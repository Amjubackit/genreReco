[Verse 1]
Look out, they're closing in on you now
Wake up or you'll wake up six feet down
Nobody's got your back in this town
Knock 'em in the teeth now
Out here, there's no negotiation
No room to start a conversation
Before you get a taste, it's taken
Never let your guard down
[Pre-Chorus]
Get back, put your hands up
Kinda messed up, but it's tough luck
And I'm sorry, but I don't feel bad for you
'Cause I know if you could switch this
You'd be dishin' out the same shit
Sayin' sorry, but I don't feel bad
[Chorus]
Now I know
There's no one I can trust
I used to think there was
Tell me that I'm cutthroat
I think you got your eyes closed
Feel the fear
And swallow back the tears
Let weakness disappear
There's nobody but me here
The killer in the mirror
Killer in the, killer in the, killer in the mirror (Er-er-er, er-er-er)
Killer in the, killer in the, killer in the mirror (Er-er-er, er-er-er)[Verse 2]
Where did all of the good people go?
They hide behind the bars on windows
In hopes they can forget we're close
Tryna get some of what they've got
'Cause I used to believe in justice
A place where there was better judgment
But now I'm feeling so disgusted
By the "have its" and the "have nots"
[Pre-Chorus]
Get back, put your hands up
Kinda messed up, but it's tough luck
And I'm sorry, but I don't feel bad for you
'Cause I know if you could switch this
You'd be dishin' out the same shit
Sayin' sorry, but I don't feel bad
[Chorus]
Now I know
There's no one I can trust
I used to think there was
Tell me that I'm cutthroat
I think you got your eyes closed
Feel the fear
And swallow back the tears
Let weakness disappear
There's nobody but me here
The killer in the mirror
Killer in the, killer in the, killer in the mirror (Er-er-er, er-er-er)
Killer in the, killer in the, killer in the mirror (Er-er-er, er-er-er)[Bridge]
Knock 'em in the teeth now
Never let your guard down
Get some of what they've got
"Have its" and the "have nots"
Knock 'em in the teeth now
Never let your guard down
When they step in your house
Knock, knock, knock, knock 'em all the fuck out
[Chorus]
Now I know
There's no one I can trust
I used to think there was
Tell me that I'm cutthroat (Yeah, tell me that I'm cutthroat)
I think you got your eyes closed (I think you got your eyes closed)
Feel the fear
And swallow back the tears
Let weakness disappear
There's nobody but me here
The killer in the mirror
Killer in the, killer in the, killer in the mirror (Killer in the mirror, yeah)
Killer in the, killer in the, killer in the mirror (Kill, oh)
[Outro]
Feel the fear
And swallow back the tears
Let weakness disappear
There's nobody but me here
The killer in the mirror
Killer in the, killer in the, killer in the mirror (Er-er-er, er-er-er)
Killer in the, killer in the, killer in the mirror (Er-er-er, er-er-er)
