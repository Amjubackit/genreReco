[Chorus]
California, rescue me
I've been so low, I've been weak
It's too long since I've had peace
Well, California, California, rescue me
[Verse 1]
In a meditative state, feeling great in the south of it
Medicated weight, think I need another ounce of it
Child of the sun and the sun of the sea
Salt water when I bleed, see eras when I dream, uh
[Pre-Chorus]
What a day, what a day, what a day now
Living like a weekend in the middle of the wave out
What you say, what you say, what you say now?
Never gonna leavе her down
[Chorus]
California, rescue mе
I've been so low, I've been weak
It's too long since I've had peace
Well, California, California, rescue me
[Post-Chorus]
Rescue me
Rescue me
California, California, rescue me[Verse 2]
I'm trippin'
California sun drippin'
Palm trees on the weekend
Suicides on the Lincoln
Got that Cali, Cali all day
Smoke that Cali, Cali, Bombay
Close my eyes, I rest in the shade
Follow me and come feel the fade, yeah
[Pre-Chorus]
What a day, what a day, what a day now
Living like a weekend in the middle of the wave out
What you say, what you say, what you say now?
Never gonna leave her down
[Chorus]
California, rescue me
I've been so low, I've been weak
It's too long since I've had peace
Well, California, California, rescue me
[Post-Chorus]
Rescue me
Rescue me
California, California, rescue me[Bridge]
This meditative state's got me feeling right
California dreamin' on a winter's night
Everywhere I look, all the leaves are brown
All the skies are gray, try to bring me down
This meditative state's got me feeling high
All the clouds are partin', only blue skies
Always catching vibes from my hometown
As long as I'm alive, can't bring me down
[Chorus]
California, rescue me
I've been so low, I've been weak
It's too long since I've had peace
Well, California, California, rescue me
[Post-Chorus]
Rescue me
Rescue me
California, California, rescue me
