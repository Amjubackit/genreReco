[Verse 1]
Wake up in the morning feelin' like P. Diddy
 
(
Hey, what up, girl?
)
Grab my glasses, I'm out the door, I'm gonna hit this city
 
(
Let's go
)
Before I leave, brush my teeth with a bottle of Jack
'Cause when I leave for the night, I ain't coming back
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm talkin' pedicure on our toes, toes
Tryin' on all our clothes, clothes
Boys blowin' up our phones, phones
Drop-toppin', playin' our favorite CDs, pullin' up to the parties
Tryna get a little bit tipsy
[Chorus]
Don't stop, make it pop, DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'ma fight 'til we see the sunlight
Tick tock on the clock, but the party don't stop, no
Oh, woah, woah, oh, oh, woah, woah, oh
Don't stop, make it pop, DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'ma fight 'til we see the sunlight
Tick tock on the clock, but the party don't stop, no
Oh, woah, woah, oh, oh, woah, woah, oh
[Verse 2]
Ain't got a care in the world, but got plenty of beer
Ain't got no money in my pocket, but I'm already here
And now the dudes are linin' up, 'cause they hear we got swagger
But we kick 'em to the curb unless they look like Mick Jagger
