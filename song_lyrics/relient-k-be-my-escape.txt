[Verse 1]
I've given up on giving up slowly
I'm blending in so you won't even know me
Apart from this whole world that shares my fate
This one last bullet you mention
Is my one last shot at redemption
'Cause I know to live, you must give your life away
[Pre-Chorus]
And I've been housing all this doubt and insecurity
And I've been locked inside that house
All the while You hold the key
And I've been dying to get out and that might be the death of me
And even though there's no way of knowing where to go
I promise I'm going because
[Chorus]
Ooh, I gotta get outta here
I'm stuck inside this rut that I fell into by mistake
Ooh, I gotta get outta here
And I'm begging You, I'm begging You
I'm begging You to be my escape
[Verse 2]
I'm given up on doing this alone now
'Cause I've failed and I'm ready to be shown how
You've told me the way and now I'm trying to get there
And this life sentence that I'm serving
I admit that I'm every bit deserving
But the beauty of grace is that it makes life not fair
