[Verse 1]
Send me some lovin'
Send it, I pray
How can I keep loving you
Honey, when you're so far, far away?
[Verse 2]
Ooh, send me your kisses
Why don't you send it, my dear?
So I can hold you
And pretend, yeah, you are here
[Bridge]
Why don't you send me your kisses?
Honey, I can feel that great love
I need you so bad
I miss you, you so much
[Outro]
My, my days are so lonely
Honey, my nights, nights are so blue
I'm here and I'm lonely
I'm waitin' for you now, all night, all night long
