[Verse 1]
Oh I'm just a kid
I never use my brain
I only use my heart
And my imagination
[Verse 2]
Oh I'm just a kid
I always make mistakes
And I never say I'm sorry
'Cause they're mistakes that I made
(Get ready, now)
[Verse 3]
Oh I'm just a kid
I've never seen the world
And I haven't quite decided
If I'm a boy or a girl
[Verse 4]
Oh I'm just a kid
I'm afraid of the dark
But I'm obsessed with ideas
One day I'll go far
[Verse 5]
Oh I'm no longer a kid
And everything has changed
There's nothing in my heart
And lightning in my brain
[Verse 6]
So listen up you kids
And hear what I say
Don't listen to your brain
And follow your dreams
