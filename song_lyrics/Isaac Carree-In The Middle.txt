[Intro]
Hello
Am I on?
Okay go
Ladies and gentlemen thank you for coming tonight
I got a young man I'd like to introduce you to
We call him "Ike Nice" (
Ike Nice
)
[Verse 1]
Tears rolling down your face
And your heart feelin' like it's gon' break
And your earth feels like it's 'bout to shake
And you've taken all that you can take
Just remember where your help comes from
Realizing you got somewhere to run
Don't worry 'bout what you're going through
Instead of worrying, here's what you can do
[Chorus]
Praise him anyway
In the middle of it
In the middle of it
In the middle of it
You should praise him anyway
In the middle of it
In the middle of it
In the middle of it
