[Intro]
Get ready for action!
[Verse 1: Tom DeLonge & (Mark Hoppus)]
I got no regret right now (I'm feelin' this!)
The air is so cold and null (I'm feelin' this!)
Let me go in her room (I'm feelin' this!)
I wanna take off her clothes (I'm feelin' this!)
Show me the way to bed (I'm feelin' this!)
Show me the way you move (I'm feelin' this!)
Fuck it, it's such a blur (I'm feelin' this!)
I love all the things you do (I'm feelin' this!)
[Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna
[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge & (Mark Hoppus)]
Where do we go from here?
Turn all the lights down now
Smiling from ear to ear (I'm feelin' this!)
Our breathing's got too loud (I'm feelin' this!)
Show me the bedroom floor (I'm feelin' this!)
Show me the bathroom mirror (I'm feelin' this!)
We're taking this way too slow (I'm feelin' this!)
Take me away from here (I'm feelin' this!)
