[Intro]
(The fuck?)
[Refrain]
You got a Slurpee for free
I caught you lookin' at me in the 7-Eleven
Under fluorescent lights
[Verse 1]
We walked in comfy silence
Footsteps down familiar sidewalk
Knowing that we were here in our dreams last night
[Chorus]
All my ghosts are with me
I know you feel them too
Ridinâ€™ shotgun next to your free Slurpee
They know all of my habits, but they don't know about you
I hope that's true
Mmm
Mmm, hmm
[Verse 2]
We made sangria and failed
I spilled mac and cheese on my pants
And thought about kissing you underneath kitchen lights
