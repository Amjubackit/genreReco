[Verse 1]
There's something right about you
Something right about you
That I wanna get to
You're stuck inside my head
[Pre-Chorus]
Keep my cool
With you here by my side, make my move
Now everything's in line
Ain't no way
That I'm changing my mind
Ain't no way
[Chorus]
Can I replace all your lonely nights?
Lonely nights
Can I replace all your lonely nights?
Lonely nights
[Verse 2]
It's everything about you
Everything about you
That I wanna get to
Is something gonna take?[Pre-Chorus]
Keep my cool
With you here by my side
Make my move
[Chorus]
Can I replace all your lonely nights?
Lonely nights
Can I replace all your lonely nights?
Lonely nights
(Lonely nights)
(Lonely nights)
[Bridge]
If you need somebody
I could be the one
If you need somebody
I could be the one
If you need somebody
I could be the one
If you need somebody
[Chorus]
Can I replace all your lonely nights?
Lonely nights
Can I replace all your lonely nights?
Lonely nights[Outro]
If you need somebody (Lonely nights)
I could be the one
If you need somebody (Lonely nights)
I could be the one
If you need somebody (Lonely nights)
I could be the one
If you need somebody (Lonely nights)
