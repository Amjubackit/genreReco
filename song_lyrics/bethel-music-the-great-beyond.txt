[Verse 1: Brian Johnson]
In the silence, in the still
In the mystery revealed
You're the anchor I will cling to
Holy Spirit lead me on
You're the peace that overcomes
Take heart, have courage
[Chorus: Brian Johnson]
I lift my eyes up to the Heavens
I know Your love will break through
I fix my eyes on the horizon
I know Your love will break through
[Verse 2: Amanda Cook]
You're the whisper on the wind
A true and constant friend
Full of hope and quiet confidence
You're the voice that never sleeps
Always singing over me
Take heart, have courage
Take heart, have courage
[Chorus: Brian Johnson & Amanda Cook]
I lift my eyes up to the Heavens
I know Your love will break through
I fix my eyes on the horizon
I know Your love will break through[Interlude]
[Bridge: Amanda Cook]
I'm resting in the great beyond
What we know and what will come
'Cause You are a world without an end
And even in the great unknown
We have a hope, we have a home
'Cause You are a world without an end
I'm resting in the great beyond
What we know and what will come
'Cause You are a world without an end
And even in the great unknown
We have a hope, we have a home
'Cause You are a world without an end
Oh God, You are a world without an end
[Chorus: Brian Johnson & Amanda Cook, 
Amanda Cook
]
I lift my eyes up to the Heavens
I know Your love will break through (
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
)
I fix my eyes on the horizon
I know Your love will break through
(
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, oh
)
I lift my eyes up to the Heavens
I know Your love will break through
I fix my eyes on the horizon
I know Your love will break through (
You're breaking through
)[Post-Chorus: Brian Johnson, 
Brian Johnson & Amanda Cook
]
Even when my heart is breaking
Even when my strength is failing
I know Your love will break through
And even in the darkest night
Even when I've lost the fight
I know Your love will break through
