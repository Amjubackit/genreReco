[Verse 1]
We get some rules to follow
That and this, these and those
No one knows
We get these pills to swallow
How they stick in your throat
Tastes like gold
Oh, what you do to me
No one knows
[Chorus]
And I realize you're mine
Indeed a fool am I
And I realize you're mine
Indeed a fool am I
[Verse 2]
I journey through the desert
Of the mind with no hope
I follow
I drift along the ocean
Dead lifeboat in the sun
End come undone
Pleasantly caving in
I come undone
