[Intro]
Let the bodies hit the floor
Let the bodies hit the floor
Let the bodies hit the floor
Let the bodies hit the... floor!
[Verse 1]
Beaten why for (Why for)
Can't take much more
(Here we go, here we go, here we go now)
[Pre-Chorus]
One, nothing wrong with me
Two, nothing wrong with me
Three, nothing wrong with me
Four, nothing wrong with me
One, something's got to give
Two, something's got to give
Three, something's got to give
Now!
[Chorus]
Let the bodies hit the floor
Let the bodies hit the floor
Let the bodies hit the-
Let the bodies hit the floor
Let the bodies hit the floor
Let the bodies hit the-
