She said, "Be honest with how you feel"
I said, "That's easier said than done"
I said, "Don't worry about the future"
She said, "That's easier said than done"
[Pre-Chorus]
Well, it is
'Cause true love, it ain't easy, no
[Verse 2]
She said, "Just show me this love is real"
I said, "That's easier said than done"
I said, "Just trust the way you feel"
She said, "That's easier said than done"

Well, it is
'Cause true love, it ain't easy, no
[Chorus]
True love, true love
It's worth it in the end (Ooh, yes, it is)
True lovе, true love
It's worth it in the еnd (Ooh, yes, it is)
