[Verse 1]
You can't lie to yourself after lovin' somethin' true
And I've never loved a soul quite the way that I love you
You told me you despise everything that I've become
How we always turn into everything we're runnin' from
[Verse 2]
And I miss the way you followed when you jaywalked in the street
How you always talked more trash than any boy bad mouthin' me
And the way that the oak creaked when you snuck up from my bed
The way that missin' someone will have you seein' steady red
[Chorus]
Take it slow as you leave me
Don't you go home this evenin'
With someone that you're actin' like is me
And I will try my hardest darlin'
Wait on a star that's fallin'
And I will wait so patiently
One thing I have quickly come to know
Nothing kills you slower than lettin' someone go
[Chorus]
Take it slow as you leave me
Don't you go home this evenin'
With someone that you're actin' like is me
And I will try my hardest darlin'
Wait on a star that's fallin'
And I will wait so desperately
One thing I have quickly come to know
Nothing kills you slower than lettin' someone go[Refrain]
You can't lie to yourself after lovin' something true
And I've never loved a soul quite the way that I loved you
And you told me you despise everything that I've become
How we've always turn into all the things we're runnin' from
[Chorus]
Take it slow as you leave me
Don't you go home this evenin'
With someone that you're actin' like is me
And I will try my hardest darlin'
Wait on a star that's fallin'
And I will wait so desperately
One thing I have quickly come to know
Nothing kills you slower than lettin' someone go
