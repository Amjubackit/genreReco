[Verse 1]
I saw your name on a street sign
In the middle of nowhere
And that has to mean something
I know your zodiac sign
Me and Leos get along great
And that has to mean something
[Chorus]
But for some reason
You're not here
And I refuse to believe
That means something
[Break]
Oh, oh
[Verse 2]
I felt the way that you hugged me
When I was broken inside
And that has to mean something
I felt the way that you kissed me
When we got too drunk that night
And that had to mean something (Something, something)
[Chorus]
But for some reason
You're not here
And I refuse to believe
That means something
