[Intro]
You, ooh-ooh, ooh
You, ooh-ooh, ooh
[Verse 1]
Why do I depend on you?
Six then I'm about to pull up
Think about your body too much
I'm feeling you for real
Missing the party for what?
There ain't nobody but us
[Pre-Chorus]
Love me like I'm gonna die
Fuck me like you fantasize
Touch me like you know you provide to
Ain't one to lie to
Just one to slide through, oh
[Chorus]
What I do makes me wonder if I'm alright
Holding back feelings like it's the end of my life
That's right, you're killing me
That's right, you're killing me
[Verse 2]
Te lo juro, solo pienso en ti
Cuando me tocas y me llamas, vuelo
Adrenaline, gentlemеn right there
Skelеtons that I don't hold back
Try to stop, do you feel relaxed?
Love it when you make me feel like that, oh
[Pre-Chorus]
Love me like I'm gonna die
Fuck me like you fantasize
Touch me like you know you provide to
Ain't one to lie to
Just one to slide through, oh
[Chorus]
What I do makes me wonder if I'm alright
Holding back feelings like it's the end of my life
That's right, you're killing me (That's, right, that's right, that's right, that's, right, that's right, that's right)
That's right, you're killing me (That's, right, that's right, that's right, that's, right, that's right, that's right)
[Outro]
That's right, that's right, that's right
That's right, that's right, that's right (Ooh, ooh-ooh)
That's right, that's right, that's right (Ooh, ooh-woah)
That's right, that's right, that's right (Oh, why I kissed you?)
