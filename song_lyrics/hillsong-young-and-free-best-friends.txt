[Verse 1]
I don't want to be on my phone but I can’t be alone
Welcome to the modern way
Trying to be somebody I'm not but it's not what I want
Tell me there’s another way
[Pre-Chorus]
All of the lights I chased are now faded
All the cheap thrills were only time wasted
Tell me why society's plan should define who I am
Surely there's a higher way
[Chorus]
All of my best friends are sick of pretending
We want the truth (Na-na, na-na)
So much is missing
So give us the real thing
I know it's You
(Na-na, na-na, na)
(Na-na, na-na, na)
(Na-na, na-na, na)
[Verse 2]
I don't want a stereotype
To decide who I am
It never knew me anyway
I'm over trying to find the next hype
'Cause the high never lasts
Imma go another way
[Pre-Chorus]
All of the lights I chased are now faded
Dylan was right the times they are changing
Tell me why society's plan should define who I am
Surely there’s a higher way
[Chorus]
All of my best friends are sick of pretending
We want the truth (Na-na, na-na)
So much is missing
So give us the real thing
I know it’s You
(Na-na, na-na, na)
(Na-na, na-na, na)
(Na-na, na-na)
[Ending]
All of my best friends are sick of pretending
We want the truth (Na-na, na-na)
So much is missing
So give us the real thing
I know it's You
I know it’s You
