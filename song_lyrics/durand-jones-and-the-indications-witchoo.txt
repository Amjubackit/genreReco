[Verse 1: Aaron Frazer]
Let’s relax, unwind, and groove
And let your soul feel the fire
If you wanna get higher
Any vibe you ride, I’ll provide
Like it’s your own fantasy
Long as you are with me
[Verse 2: Aaron Frazer]
I know a place, spinnin’ records ‘til late
And my man says he’s workin’ the door
I’m on the way, full of anticipation
For a chance with you out on the floor
[Pre-Chorus: All]
Hey!
Come through!
Bring the crew!
Come through!
Bring the crew!
Come through!
Bring the crew!
I just wanna be witchoo, ayyyy!
[Chorus: Aaron Frazer and Durand Jones]
I wanna go 85
With the deuce coupe purrin’ like king of the pride
Put the soft top down, they can see me shinin’
Witchoo
Baby, witchoo
We’ll ball out like we livin’ the life
Headed uptown drippin’, lookin’ extra fly
And if the drinks keep flowin’, I can go all night
Witchoo
Baby, witchoo
[Verse 3: Durand Jones]
I know you came with your friends
But who you leaving with?
Bodies talk between the lines
And we’re both reading it
Woo!
[Verse 4: Aaron Frazer]
Know you can’t wait
To get back to my place
‘Cause you been asking where I’m finna go
I got the space if you’re bringing the case
So tell your friends I got some friends of my own
[Pre-Chorus: All]
Hey!
Come through!
Bring the crew!
Come through!
Bring the crew!
Come through!
Bring the crew!
I just wanna be witchoo, ayyyy!
[Chorus: Aaron Frazer and Durand Jones]
I wanna go 85
With the deuce coupe purrin’ like king of the pride
Put the soft top down, they can see me shinin’
Witchoo
Baby, witchoo
We’ll ball out like we livin’ the life
Headed uptown drippin’, lookin’ extra fly
And if the drinks keep flowin’, I can go all night
Witchoo
Baby, witchoo
I wanna go 85
With the deuce coupe purrin’ like king of the pride
Put the soft top down, they can see me shinin’
Witchoo
Baby, witchoo
We’ll ball out like we livin’ the life
Headed uptown drippin’, lookin’ extra fly
And if the drinks keep flowin’, I can go all night
Witchoo
Baby, witchoo, yeah!
Baby, witchoo
[Chorus: All]
I wanna go 85
With the deuce coupe purrin’ like king of the pride
Put the soft top down, they can see me shinin’
Witchoo
Baby, witchoo
We’ll ball out like we livin’ the life
Headed uptown drippin’, lookin’ extra fly
And if the drinks keep flowin’, I can go all night
Witchoo
Baby, witchoo
I wanna go 85
With the deuce coupe purrin’ like king of the pride
Put the soft top down, they can see me shinin’
Witchoo
Baby, witchoo
We’ll ball out like we livin’ the life
Headed uptown drippin’, lookin’ extra fly
