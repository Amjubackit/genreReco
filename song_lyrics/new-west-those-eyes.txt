[Verse 1]
When we’re out in a crowd laughing loud and nobody knows why
When we’re lost at a club getting drunk and you give me that smile
Going home in the back of a car and your hand touches mine
When we’re done making love and you look up and give me those eyes
[Chorus]
'
Cause all of the small things that you do
Are what remind me why I fell for you
And when we’re apart and I’m missing you
I close my eyes and all I see is you
And the small things you do
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 2]
When you call me at night while you’re out getting high with your friends (Out with your friends)
Every "hi", every "bye", every "I love you" you’ve ever said (You've ever said)
[Chorus]
'Cause all of the small things that you do
Are what remind me why I fell for you
And when we’re apart and I’m missing you
I close my eyes and all I see is you
And the small things you do
