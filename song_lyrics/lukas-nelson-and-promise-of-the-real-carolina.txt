Lord I love you Carolina
I like you beach and your beer
I park my bus up on the levee
Next to a sandy pier
I like your waves and your women
I like to dance all night
If my baby doesn't love me
I'm going to Carolina tonight
Carolina
Carolina
If my baby doesn't love me
I'm going to Carolina tonight
I'll give her two more hours
To let her clear her head
I'm gonna roll me up a number
Waiting naked in bed
I'll take my Texas time
Because I'm feeling alright
Well, if my baby doesn't love me
I'm going to Carolina tonight
Carolina
Carolina
If my baby doesn't love me
I'm going to Carolina tonightCarolina
Carolina
Carolina
Carolina
Carolina
Carolina
Well, if my baby doesn't love me
I'm going to Carolina tonight
