[Intro]
Hey, let's go
’Cause there's a miracle in this room
With my name on it
I need some radical praisers back in the back to wave at me
There's a healing in this room, I see you back there
And it’s here for me
Can I declare it over your life?
There's a breakthrough, it's in this room
And it's got my name on it
I need somebody to holler right there
Oh! Oh-oh-oh-ohhh
So I'm gonna put a praise on it
Can I sing it like I feel it?
I'm gonna put a praise on it (Oh, yeahhh)
Can I sing it like I feel it? Somebody say, yeah
'Cause there's a miracle in this room
With Tasha’s name on it
There’s a healing in this room
Anybody need healing?
And it's here for me
There’s a breakthrough, it's in this room
And it's got my name on it
Hey! Hey!! Hey!!!
I'm gonna put a praise on it
Somebody put a praise on it (Oh, yeahhh)
You outta put a praise on it (Oh, yeahhh)
I need you to lean on your neighbor like this and say
"Can you help me put a praise on it?" (Oh, yeahhh) 141
Let’s go, let's go
Clap, clap, clap, clap
Clap, clap, clap, clap
Let's turn it up Passion, let's go, come on
Let's say it together
[Verse]
There's a miracle in this room
There's a miracle in this room
With my name on it
There's a healing in this room
Anybody need it
And it is here for me
There's a breakthrough
There's a breakthrough in this room
With my name on it
I see you dancing back there, I've got a question
So what you gone do? Put your hands up, say
[Chorus]
So I'm gonna put a praise on it
You got it
I'm gonna put a praise
I'm gonna put a praise on it
Where are the radical praisers at?
So I'm gonna put a praise
So I'm gonna put a praise on it
'Cause a miracle just dropped in my house
I'm gonna put a praise
I'm gonna put a praise on it
Praisers, one more time, you all say
So I'm gonna put a praise
So I'm gonna put a praise on it
We might as well go to church
I'm gonna put a praise
I'm gonna put a praise on it
Dancing like that I'm gonna join ya
So I'm gonna put a praise
So I'm gonna put a praise on it
I'm gonna put a praise
I'm gonna put a praise on it
One more time
So I'm gonna put a praise
So I'm gonna put a praise on it
Somebody clap your hands
I'm gonna put a praise
I'm gonna put a praise on it
So I'm gonna put a praise on it
So I'm gonna put a praise on it
I'm gonna put a praise
I'm gonna put a praise on it
[Spontaneous]
Break it down for me, break it down for me
If you feel good, somebody scream
So a lotta times in church
We clap our hands to transition a moment
But the clapping of the hands is actually a praise called "The Takrah Praise"
And it's the clapping of the hands
And what it says is: Every time I clap my hands
Everything that's been declared over me prophetically, when I put my hands together
I'm saying: And it is so
So we prophesy to our health
We prophesy to our finances
We prophesy to our relationships
We prophesy to our education
And we speak wholeness over our lives
If you believe that God is doing a miracle in your life tonight
I need you to put your hands together
Somebody clap it up: one, two, three
Clap, clap, clap, clap
[Outro]
Hey, I feel real good in the room
Somebody clap between ourselves
Clap, clap, clap
One more time, leap for joy
We got one more time
I need everybody in this room
To get your feet off the floor and leap
Leap, leap, leap
I'm gonna put a praise
I'm gonna put a praise on it
Clap, clap, clap
Last time
I'm gonna put a
I'm gonna put a praise on it
Somebody shout "Yeah"
