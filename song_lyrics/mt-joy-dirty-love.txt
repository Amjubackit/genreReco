[Verse 1]
I know you think I think too much
But I don't know if it's enough
Dirty love, all I want are your eyes on mine
And underneath of it all
I dream of our fall six shooters
Hallelujahs, aren't able to save us
[Chorus]
But did I ever want love?
Or, did I ask too much?
Young dirty love, come get us drunk
Let's cover up what we really want
[Verse 2]
And, all you see and all you feel
Are skin and bones they don't hold the soul like real love
No, you can't control who you really are or what you really want
So, I met you in the hotel, dim lit, lobby
Iâ€™ve been on the road since you last saw me
And I don't need a reason to bleed until we're even
[Chorus]
But did I ever want love?
Or, did I ask too much?
Young dirty love, come get us drunk
Let's cover up what we really want[Outro]
Oh, is it any wonder our love
Isn't what we thought it was?
Is it any wonder our love
Isn't what we thought it was?
Is it any wonder, oh lord
Is it any wonder our love
Isn't what we thought it was?
When all we do is hurt ourselves
