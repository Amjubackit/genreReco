[Chorus: Kali Uchis]
I gotta take some time to grow
But I don't wanna let you go
How did we get too comfortable?
I gotta take some time to grow
But without you, I’m miserable
I think I got too comfortable
[Verse 1: Kali Uchis]
We could take it to the day that I saw you
On your way to the top
Or we could take it to the time that I saw you
Lose your mind and give up
Everybody gets down on luck
Every time you fall, I try to pick you up
But I need reciprocation
[Pre-Chorus 1: Kali Uchis]
You got what I need to
Get through the night
But can you be my rock? (Boy)
Slippin', can you pull me up? (No)
I just want to be your girl and not your mom
Is that so wrong?
[Chorus: Kali Uchis]
I gotta take some time to grow
But I don't wanna let you go
How did we get too comfortable?
I gotta take some time to grow
But without you, I’m miserable
I think I got too comfortable
[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Look at me watering seeds, it's time to grow
I get out of control when I'm alone
If you can make it with me, you can make it on your own
So quit the bullshit and playing on my phone
We just need some time
Keep watching, let it all unwind
You get yours, of course, I get mine
And in the end, everything will be fine, that's by design
Well, I don't trip, but I slip, I fall
Sleep all day, maybe miss your calls
Like I been missing you
Still, I continue, tied up and tripping up
I'm making the wrong decisions and you sick of it all
But don't leave me, don't leave me
Because it feel too good to be easy (Yeah)
It’s been a while, and I’m even different now
Shit, I'll probably make it better when you see me
[Chorus: Kali Uchis]
I gotta take some time to grow
But I don’t wanna let you go
How did we get too comfortable?
I gotta take some time to grow
But without you, I'm miserable
I think I got too comfortable
[Pre-Chorus 2: Kali Uchis]
You got what I need to
Get through the night
See, I don't ask for much (No)
I just want to talk and touch (No)
I just want to be your girl and not your mom
Is that so wrong?
[Chorus: Kali Uchis]
I gotta take some time to grow
But without you, I'm miserable
I think I got too comfortable
