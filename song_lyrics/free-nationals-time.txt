[Chorus: Kali Uchis]
I gotta take some time to grow
But I don't wanna let you go
How did we get too comfortable?
I gotta take some time to grow
But without you, I’m miserable
I think I got too comfortable
[Verse 1: Kali Uchis]
We could take it to the day that I saw you
On your way to the top
Or we could take it to the time that I saw you
Lose your mind and give up
Everybody gets down on luck
Every time you fall, I try to pick you up
But I need reciprocation
[Pre-Chorus 1: Kali Uchis]
You got what I need to
Get through the night
But can you be my rock? (Boy)
Slippin', can you pull me up? (No)
I just want to be your girl and not your mom
Is that so wrong?
[Chorus: Kali Uchis]
I gotta take some time to grow
But I don't wanna let you go
How did we get too comfortable?
I gotta take some time to grow
But without you, I’m miserable
I think I got too comfortable
