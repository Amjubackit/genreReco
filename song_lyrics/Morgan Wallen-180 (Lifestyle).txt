[Intro]
Woo
[Chorus]
She don't come from it but, nah, she ain't runnin' from me, yeah, she lovin' the lifestyle
Took a Broadway city girl, turned her into a red dirt wild child (Woo)
Woah, oh-oh-oh, she get the mood right
Woah, oh-oh-oh, chasin' the moonlight
She don't come from it but, nah, she ain't runnin' from me, yeah, she lovin' the lifestyle (Woo)
[Verse 1]
She used to show up in her high heels
Now she's barefoot in a Friday night field
She turn her nose up at the whiskey
Now she tastes like number seven whеn she kiss me
Daddy ain't sure about it
Shе wants to move on out to who knows where
She got some down home, she just found it
She got the whole town thinkin' that she grew up there, yeah (Woo)
[Chorus]
She don't come from it but, nah, she ain't runnin' from me, yeah, she lovin' the lifestyle
Took a Broadway city girl, turned her into a red dirt wild child (Woo)
Woah, oh-oh-oh, she get the mood right
Woah, oh-oh-oh, chasin' the moonlight
She don't come from it but, nah, she ain't runnin' from me, yeah, she lovin' the lifestyle (Woo)
