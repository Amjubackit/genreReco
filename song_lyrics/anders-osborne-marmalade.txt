Baby don't tell me that i'm doing wrong
I know where i'm headin' and i'm going strong
You think she's stupid and way too young
If anybody's stupid you're the one
You believe she's naive
She only got a different way to perceive
She really speaks freely
But she never talk when there ain't no need
Oh mama, oh mama, oh mama yeah
Oh mama, oh mama, who are you to talk?
Our memories are getting vague and dim
When you meet me on the street you are short and grim
Don't block the light with your stubborn face
I'm happy again and up ahead i gaze
A second chance and i got plans
To change my way of thinking in a positive way
If you don't like it it's time to quit
Tell me what to do, and what to say
Oh mama, oh mama, oh mama yeah
Oh mama, oh mama, who are you to talk?
There's no regrets from my side
But you seem to fight with your personal pride
If you don't care if i'm dead or alive
How come you're handing out good advise?
You're in a dead end and all you send
Is a desperate need for someone to blame
Don't worry your head find your own way instead
I found my heaven, i wish you the sameOh mama, oh mama, oh mama yeah
Oh mama, oh mama, who are you to talk?
(instrumental break)
(4x)
Oh mama, oh mama, oh mama yeah
Oh mama, oh mama, who are you to talk?
