[Verse 1]
Their human bones are as fragile as mine
I have my flaws, but they have the same kind
I was ashamed 'cause I couldn't see
That grace says that they're in the same boat as me
[Chorus 1]
But what I lack
You are full of
And where I'm broken
You are whole
And what I'm doubting
You are sure of
So I'll trust the Lover
Lover of my soul
[Verse 2]
I'm not afraid of the arrows by day
Nor the darkness that comes when the sun rolls away
Lord, You know that my strength never lasts
But You make up for every weakness I have
[Chorus 1]
And what I lack
You are full of
And where I'm broken
You are whole
And what I'm doubting
You are sure of
I'll trust the Lover
Lover of my soul, yeah
