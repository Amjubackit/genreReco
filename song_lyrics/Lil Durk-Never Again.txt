[Verse 1]
I was too lazy, I had to get up
He died from cancer, he ain't get a check-up
I went Travis Barker, tatted the neck up
I feel better, gettin' deep in religion
Court for child supports visits, I'm better
Say you love me with a hidden agenda
Low self-esteem, I took down the mirror
Stole from me, old management devils
Trenches broke, I gotta hold 'em together
Tryna claim thе lil' boy, I'm better
If I'ma change, I'ma changе forever
I ain't tryna stay in this lane forever
He was that nigga, now servin' cheddar (Cheese)
I die, niggas won't T up for me
You wasn't there for who helped you
You think you gon' be there for me?
[Pre-Chorus]
Feel like a dream, pourin' up the lean
Turned me a to man, they plan's just to leave
