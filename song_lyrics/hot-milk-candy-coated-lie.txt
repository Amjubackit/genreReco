[Verse 1: Hannah Mee]
Just about done livin' this life
Look at my face when you're talking to me, talking to me
Brought a blunt knife to a gun fight
Words and phrases lock me in cages
I'm taking my time if it's alright
Hold the world up but it's weighing on me, weighing on me
Watch it all fall from a great height
All these rats that are running races
[Pre-Chorus: Jim Shaw]
Stay away, you push me to the edge
I need a tidal wave to drown out all the pain in me
[Chorus: Hannah Mee]
Just about to break, I can't stand the taste of
Candy coated lies, these candy coated lies
Every day the same, driving me insane
Candy coated lies, these candy coated lies
[Verse 2: Jim Shaw & Hannah Mee]
You're killin' my vibe for the last time
Vultures up high started preying on me, preying on me
Take a step back to the broadside
'Cause I'm not as brave as I'm letting on to be
Losing my breath but I'm alive
Should have spent more time fighting for me, fighting for me
Making my way to the bright side
Is there paradise?[Chorus: Hannah Mee]
Just about to break, I can't stand the taste of
Candy coated lies, these candy coated lies
Every day the same, driving me insane
Candy coated lies, these candy coated lies
[Bridge: Jim Shaw]
Talons digging deep down inside of me
Holding this absentee, guilty and desperately
[Chorus: Hannah Mee]
Just about to break, I can't stand the taste of
Candy coated lies, these candy coated lies
Every day the same, driving me insane
Candy coated lies, these candy coated lies
Just about to break, I can't stand the taste of
Candy coated lies, these candy coated lies
Every day the same, driving me insane
Candy coated lies, these candy coated lies
[Outro: Jim Shaw, 
Hannah Mee
]
Stay away, you push me to edge
Candy coated lies, these candy coated lies
I need a tidal wave, to drown out all the pain in these
Candy coated lies, these candy coated lies
