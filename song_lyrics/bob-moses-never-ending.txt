[Verse 1]
Fading, slowly time erases
Memories I've made in
These nights with you
Somehow wish the world would slow down
When I turn the lights out
I finally see the truth
[Refrain]
Oooh, ooooh
Oooh, ooooh
[Verse 2]
Leaving isn't ever easy
Staring at the ceiling
Before the dawn
Breathe in, hold onto this feeling
I can't quite believe it
The time has come
[Refrain]
Oooh, ooooh
I'm leaving you
[Chorus]
Don't want to give you up
There's never time enough
I want to live like this is nеver ending
Just want to feel your touch
No need to say too much
I wanna live likе this is never ending
I'm running out of luck
Promises ain't enough
Wonder how long I can go on pretending
Don't wanna give you up
There's never time enough
I wanna live like this is never ending[Verse 3]
You say there's no use contemplating the path not taken
It's dead and gone
Maybe we could have it our way
If not now then someday
So I keep holding on
[Refrain]
Oooh, ooooh
Holding you
[Chorus]
Don't want to give you up
There's never time enough
I want to live like this is never ending
Just want to feel your touch
No need to say too much
I wanna live like this is never ending
I'm running out of luck
Promises ain't enough
Wonder how long I can go on pretending
Don't wanna give you up
There's never time enough
I wanna live like this is never ending
