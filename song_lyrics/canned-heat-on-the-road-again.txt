[Verse 1]
Well, I'm so tired of cryin' but I'm out on the road again
I'm on the road again
Well, I'm so tired of cryin' but I'm out on the road again
I'm on the road again
I ain't got no woman just to call my special friend
[Verse 2]
You know the first time I traveled out in the rain and snow
In the rain and snow
You know the first time I traveled out in the rain and snow
In the rain and snow
I didn't have no payroll, not even no place to go
[Verse 3]
And my dear mother left me when I was quite young
When I was quite young
And my dear mother left me when I was quite young
When I was quite young
She said "Lord, have mercy on my wicked son"
[Harmonica Solo]
[Verse 4]
Take a hint from me, mama, please, don't you cry no more
Don't you cry no more
Take a hint from me, mama, please, don't you cry no more
Don't you cry no more
'Cause it's soon one mornin' down the road I'm goin'
[Verse 5]
But I ain't goin' down that long, old lonesome road
All by myself
But I ain't goin' down that long, old lonesome road
All by myself
I can't carry you, baby, gonna carry somebody else
