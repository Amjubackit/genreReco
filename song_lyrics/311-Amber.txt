[Intro]
Brainstorm, take me away from the norm
I got to tell you somethin'
This phenomenon, I had to put it in a song
And it goes like
[Chorus]
Whoa, amber is the color of your energy
Whoa, shades of gold displayed naturally
[Verse 1]
You wanna know what brings me here, oh
You glide through my head, blind to fear
And I know why
[Chorus]
Whoa, amber is the color of your energy
Whoa, shades of gold displayed naturally
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
Whoa, amber is the color of your energy
Whoa, shades of gold displayed naturally
[Bridge]
You live too far away
Your voice rings like a bell anyway
Don't give up your independence
Unless it feels so right
Nothing good comes easily
Sometimes you've got to fight
