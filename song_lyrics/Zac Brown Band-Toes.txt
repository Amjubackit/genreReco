[Intro]
I got my toes in the water, ass in the sand
Not a worry in the world, a cold beer in my hand
Life is good today, life is good today
[Verse 1]
Well, the plane touched down just about three o'clock
And the city's still on my mind
Bikinis and palm trees danced in my head
I was still in the baggage line
Concrete and cars are their own prison bars
Like this life I'm living in
But the plane brought me farther, I'm surrounded by water
And I'm not going back again
[Pre-Chorus]
I got my toes in the water, ass in the sand
Not a worry in the world, a cold beer in my hand
Life is good today, life is good today
[Chorus 1]
Adios and vaya con Dios
Yeah, I'm leaving GA
And if it weren't for tequila and pretty se√±oritas
I'd have no 
reason
 to stay
Adios and vaya con Dios
Yeah, I'm leaving GA
Going to lay in the hot sun and 
roll a big fat one
And grab my guitar and play
