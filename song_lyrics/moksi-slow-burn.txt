[Verse 1]
I was broken, feelin' the burn
Living half a life
Wanting to be okay
Dying to be okay
Heart open, and trembling
Smoke fillin' in my lungs
Wanting to be okay
Dying to be okay
Still fallin', memory forgotten
And my lovin'? Only good at losin'
The question adding to the burning
Through the flames shown how I was hearing
[Chorus]
That's a
Slow
Burn, baby
Slow
Burn, baby
(burn, burn, burn, ...)
[Verse 2]
And the light of the fire
Fighting with my doll
Why it gotta be so hard?
Why is it so hard?Wounded but moving
Nothin' is holdin' me
I just want to breath
Oh, I, I know I got to breath
Still fallin', memory forgotten
And my lovin'? Only good at losin'
The question adding to the burning
Through the flames shown how I was hearing
[Chorus]
A slow...
Slow
Burn, baby
Slow
Burn, baby
(burn, burn, burn, ...)
