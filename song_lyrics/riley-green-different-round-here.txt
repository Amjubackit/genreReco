[Verse 1]
'Round here fast is how the grass grows
Lost  is what you find on a back road
Proof's  in the whiskey, red's in the dirt
And hard work stops at the fence row
We stand for the flag and if you don't like it we don't care
'Cause  we do things a little different 'round here
[Chorus]
Brave  is 18 wearin' army green
Truth is in the words, in red we read
Proud  is what you say about where you're from
Heroes are daddies and mamas are love
The right is right and wrong is wrong
Yeah, we're doin' things a little different 'round here
[Verse 2]
Easy's  at the end of a long day
Free's how you feel not what you pay
Simple's how we live, thanks is what we give
Roots in the ground's why we stay
[Chorus]
Brave is 18 wearin' army green
Truth is in the words, in red we read
Proud is what you say about where you're from
Heroes are daddies and mamas are love
The right is right and wrong is wrong
Yeah, we're doin' things a little different 'round here
