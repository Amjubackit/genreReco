[Verse 1]
I should move
'Cause New York is getting muddy out
There's LA
But it's always kinda sunny out
And I don't wanna hurt no more
So I set my bar real low
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm a-okay, I'm a-okay
You say it but you just don't mean it
You're so insane, you're so insane
Shut up and just enjoy this feeling
[Chorus]
Don't you love it? Don't you love it?
No, I ain't happy yet, but I'm way less sad
Don't you love it? Don't you love it?
No, I ain't happy yet, but I'm way less sad
[Post-Chorus]
But I'm way less sad
But I'm way less sad
[Verse 2]
I wake up
And I'm not so mad at Twitter now
Living sucks
But it's sucking just a little now
And I don't wanna cry no more
So I set my bar real low[Pre-Chorus]
I'm a-okay, I'm a-okay
You say it but you just don't mean it
You're so insane, you're so insane
Shut up and just enjoy this feeling
[Chorus]
Don't you love it? Don't you love it?
No, I ain't happy yet, but I'm way less sad
Don't you love it? Don't you lovе it?
No, I ain't happy yet (Happy yet), but I'm way less sad
I may bе wrong, I may be wrong
It's stupid but it's all I have
Don't you love it? Don't you love it?
No, I ain't happy yet, but I'm way less sad
[Bridge]
Well, I can't fall asleep, and I'm losing my mind
'Cause it's half-past three and my brain's on fire
I been counting sheep, but the sheep all died
And I'm trying too hard, but I can't not try
Well, I can't fall asleep, and I'm losing my mind
'Cause it's half-past three and my brain's on fire
I been counting sheep, but the sheep all died
And I'm not dead yet, so I guess I'll be alright[Chorus]
Don't you love it? Don't you love it?
No, I ain't happy yet (Happy yet), but I'm way less sad
Don't you love it? Don't you love it?
No, I ain't happy yet, but I'm way less sad
I may be wrong (I may be wrong)
I may be wrong (I may be wrong)
It's stupid but it's all I have
Don't you love it? Don't you love it?
No, I ain't happy yet, but I'm way less sad
[Outro]
