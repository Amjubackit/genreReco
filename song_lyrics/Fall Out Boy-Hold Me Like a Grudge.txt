[Verse 1]
When you ask how I've been
I know you mean well, I know you mean well
Who am I dialing tonight? That's a bummer
Thaw out my freezer 
burn feelings for twenty summers
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm just a cherub riding comets through the night sky
Screaming at the stars like night lights
And I love my life, love my life
Running middle fingers through the red lights
And I guess I'm getting older 'cause I'm less pissed
When I can't get onto the guest list
To the end of the world, the end of the world
Fever-dream tangerine sweat
When I get down, down
Silent killers are these years coming like waves
(You put the "fun" into dysfunction)
[Chorus]
Hold me, hold me like a grudge
The world is always spinning, and I can't keep up, woah
Faster and faster, 
can't do it on my own
Part-time soulmate, full-time problem, yeah
So, hold me like a grudge
