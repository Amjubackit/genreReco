[Intro]
(Right?)
(Right?)
(Right?)
(Right?)
[Verse 1]
Well, she said she'd only take me
If I were the only man alive
When she's standin' right in front of me
I'm about to lose my mind
I feel it breakin'
No, my heart ain't worth the savin' tonight (Woo-hoo)
[Verse 2]
It's like I'm movin' in slow motion
And I'm blinded by the sound
See, my body's in the ocean
But my head is underground
I tried to pin it
But her heart, I'll never win it, so goodnight
[Chorus]
Even though the girl's a looker
We're only blood and sugar, right?
(Blood and sugar, only blood and sugar)
No, I never understood her
We're only blood and sugar, right?
[Verse 3]
Well, she said she wouldn't comе for me
She's gonna leavе me high and dry
See, our love could be a symphony
But she'd rather let it die than be together
Yeah, she swears I'll never ever get inside (Inside)
[Chorus]
Well, I wish I knew what shook her
We're only blood and sugar, right?
(Blood and sugar, only blood and sugar)
No, I never understood her
We're only blood and sugar, right?
[Post-Chorus]
Only blood and sugar, right?
(Na-na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na)
(Na-na-na-na-na-na-na)
Only blood and sugar, right?
[Bridge]
I gotta taper off the medicine
Pick my back up off the floor
Need a fix of some adrenaline
Get my ass up out the door and find another
I could use a better lover in my life (In my life)
[Chorus]
Still I wish I knew what took her
We're only blood and sugar, right?
(Blood and sugar, only blood and sugar)
No, I never understood her
We're only blood and sugar, right?
(Blood and sugar, only blood and sugar)
Why's my heart still in the cooker
If we're only blood and sugar, right?
[Outro]
Yeah, blood and sugar, baby
Ooh, only blood and sugar, right?
(Na-na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na, blood and sugar, only blood and sugar)
(Na-na-na-na-na-na-na, blood and sugar, only blood and sugar)
Yeah, we're only, yeah (Just blood and sugar, yeah)
No, I never understood her
We're only blood and sugar, right?
