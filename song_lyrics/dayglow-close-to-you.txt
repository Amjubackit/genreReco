[Verse 1]
I saw you looking for the side door
You didn't want to stick around for
The rest of the night
I guess that's alright
They all left when you walked home
It makes sense that they all know
It was only for you
If only you knew
[Pre-Chorus]
What good is love
Without any strings?
Held it above
Stuck in between
Tell me for once
What that even means
I wanna know you
But can't make it right
[Chorus]
There's something on my mind
There's something that I
(Wish I would've told you, but you just don't seem)
(To wonder what I'm doing when you're close to me)
Oh yeah
There's somеthing on my chest
I wish I would've said
(I think it over and it might bе true)
(I'm only overthinking when I'm close to you)[Verse 2]
We locked eyes from a distance
So close, but I missed it
Now you're walking away
When I wish you would stay
I get stuck in a conversation
A different night, same situation
I beat myself up
For not speaking up
[Pre-Chorus]
Every night I can't make it right, yeah
[Chorus]
There's something on my mind
There's something that I
(Wish I would've told you, but you just don't seem)
(To wonder what I'm doing when you're close to me)
Oh yeah
There's something on my chest
I wish I would've said
(I think it over and it might be true)
(I'm only overthinking when I'm close to you)
[Outro]
Only overthinking when I'm close to you
I'm only overthinking when I'm close to you
I'm only overthinking when I'm close to you, oh yeah
I'm only overthinking when I'm close to you
I'm only overthinking when I'm close to you
I'm only overthinking when I'm close to you, oh yeah
