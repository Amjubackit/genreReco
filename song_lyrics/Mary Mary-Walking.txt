[Intro: Warryn Campbell]
Boom
Now that I got your attention, yeah, hey
How ya doin' (How ya doin')
How ya doin' (How ya doin')
How ya doin', c'mon'
Baby doll, may remember (Hey)
Come back again (Yeah)
Yeah, I might walk a little
Just a second, talk to 'em
[Verse 1]
Tell me what you see when I pass by
Shadow, a cloud, or a line in the sky
Am I gettin' you wrong or am I gettin' you right?
Well, all I can take is one, one step at a time
[Pre-Chorus]
Look at me, I'm trying
Everyday, I fall down
Make mistakes, get back up
Try again, next time that you see me
[Chorus]
I'm walkin', I'm walkin', I'm walkin'
I'm walkin', I'm walkin', I'm walkin'
I'm walkin', I'm walkin', I'm walkin'
I'm walkin', I'm walkin', I'm walkin'
