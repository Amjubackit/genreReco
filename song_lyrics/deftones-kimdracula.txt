[Verse 1]
The earth will see
Our eyes go blank tonight
And the earth will rot away
Go blink tonight
[Chorus]
I, I really wish these snakes were your arms
I, I really wish you'd make up your mind
[Verse 2]
The earth disguised away
Don't blink tonight
And the earth will see our eyes
Don't blink tonight
[Chorus]
I, I really wish these snakes were your arms
I, I really wish you should make up your mind
[Bridge]
I know, know
Know, know
Know
[Chorus]
I, I really wish these snakes were your arms
I, I really wish you'd make up your mind[Outro]
I know, know, know
