[Verse 1]
I'm looking up at you, yeah
Are you looking up at me, yeah?
Our teeths shining
Teeths are shining, yeah
[Chorus]
Now I know, I know, I know I do
Even if it looks like I thought this through
We could drive into the sea
I saw you looking up at me, yeah
[Chorus]
Now I know, I know, I know I do
Even if it looks like I thought this through
We could drive into the sea
I saw you looking up at me, yeah
[Verse 2]
Are you looking up at me, yeah?
I'm looking up at you, yeah
I'm looking up at you, yeah
Are you looking up at me, yeah?
[Verse 3]
I've got nothing on
So, what are you thinking?
I'm looking up at you, yeah
Are you looking up at me, yeah?
