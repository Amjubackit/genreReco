[Intro: Theo Katzman]
All the world, yeah
All the world, yeah
All the world, yeah yeah
Ooh yeah yeah
[Verse 1: Theo Katzman]
This is a true love story song
A triumph, and a Glory song
With only one small caveat
This one hasn't happened yet
It's not the strongest narrative
But details aren't imperative
What matters is the way it ends
They've got sixteen mutual friends
[Chorus: Theo Katzman, 
Christine Hucal & Theo Katzman
]
And she's got
Animal Spirits
And he's got
Heartfelt lyrics
Put them together and
You can hear it
It's the song everyone knows
And she's got
Animal Spirits
And he's got
Heartfelt lyrics
Put them together and
You can hear it
It's the way the story goes[Verse 2: Theo Katzman]
Now everyone seems unaware
That these two are a destined pair
But I checked out their astral chart
This one is a work of art
Now I know she reads astrology
And he can't stand astrology
But he's quick with an apology
When he wisecracks the zodiac
[Chorus: Theo Katzman]
And she's got
Animal Spirits
And he's got
Heartfelt lyrics
Put them together and
You can hear it
It's the song everyone knows
And she's got
Animal Spirits
And he's got
Heartfelt lyrics
Put them together and
You can hear it
It's the way the story goes[Bridge: Theo Katzman]
Oh oh oh
And when the rising action rises
There is only one thing left, and that's the climax
[Break Down: Woody]
[Count in: Jack Stratton]
2, 3, 4
[Ad lib: Theo Katzman]
Oh oh oh yeah
Oh
[Outro: Christine Hucal]
Twitter on your telly
Ramen in your belly
Economics
Put it in my pocket
Milty, Marx and Maynard
Aries penny saver
Set a market order
Because I'm pretty sure I got this
Boulder, Colorado
Take a break at Yaddo
Economics
Put it in my pocket
Milty, Marx, and Maynard
Fairmount and Brainard
I can stay
You can stay, L.A
