It's a stolen love in the middle of the night
It's the story of you and I
Hearts on fire like a Marlboro light
Burning up, and it feels alright
A stolen love, you and I
We tore up the room
We blurred out the lines
Breaking hearts and rules at the same time
God knows it's wrong, but it feels so right
It's a stolen love, keeps us up at night
A stolen love, keep me up all night
(Chorus)
Stolen love, I keep on falling
Damn, is that your old man calling?
Tell him I'll give you back in the morning
Stolen love, I keep on falling
Falling
Baby, cut the cord
Cross that line
In the name of love
Give mе one more night
Hey, comе on, love
Give me one more night(Chorus)
Stolen love, I keep on falling
Damn, is that your old man calling?
Tell him I'll give you back in the morning
Stolen love, I keep on falling
Hey
Stolen love, this is what you wanted
You can run into my arms when he stops calling
Hey baby, he's calling
Tell him I'll give you back in the morning
Stolen love, I keep on falling
Falling
