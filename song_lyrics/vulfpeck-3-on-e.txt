[Verse 1]
I found the private key to get you off your feet
I've got the special sauce to get you out your seat
An ancient secret that's been passed down orally
Just take your lowest guitar string and hit it on the beat
[Chorus]
Three on E
Three on E
I said three on E
Three on E
[Verse 2]
A universal cheat code to unlock your funky self
A simple bass notation beneficial to your health
I have traveled far and wide to find this prophecy
So humankind and every mind could feel this three on E
[Bridge]
I go three, three on E, E, E, E, E
I like that right there!
I said three on E, E, E, E, E
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Uh
[Chorus]
I go three on E
Three on E
I-I said three on E
Whoo! Three on E
Y-y-y-y-yeah[Coda]
Three on E
Come on, come on, come on, I said
Three on E
Three on E
Sweeter than a sweet sixteen, come on
Three on E
Three on E
Three on E
Ain't nothing wrong with that
I said three on E
Three on E
One more time, y'all
Three on E!
