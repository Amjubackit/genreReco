[Verse 1]
Once was a sweet thing, baby
Held that love in our hands
Now I reach to kiss your lips
It just don't mean a thing
[Chorus]
And that's a cold shot, baby
Yeah that's a drag
A cold shot, baby
I've let our love go bad
[Verse 2]
Remember the way that you loved me
Do anything I say
Now I see you out somewhere
You won't give me the time of day
[Chorus]
And that's a cold shot, girl
Yeah that's a drag
And that's a cold shot, baby
We'd better learn from that
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
I really meant I was sorry
Forever causing you pain
You showed your appreciation
By walking out anyway
[Chorus]
And that's a cold shot, baby
Yeah that's a drag
That's a cold shot, baby
We'd better learn from that
So sad
Too bad
So sad
[Outro: Spoken]
Don't let our true love run cold
