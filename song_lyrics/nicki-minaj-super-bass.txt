[Intro: Nicki Minaj]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, hey
[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
This one is for the boys with the boomin' system
Top down, AC with the cooler system
When he come up in the club, he be blazin' up
Got stacks on deck like he savin' up
And he ill, he real, he might gotta deal
He pop bottles and he got the right kind of build
He cold, he dope, he might sell 
coke
He always in the air, but he never fly coach
He a mothafuckin trip, trip, sailor of the ship, ship
When he make it drip, drip, kiss him on the lip, lip
That's the kinda dude I was lookin' for
And yes, you'll get slapped if you're lookin', ho
[Pre-Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
I said, excuse me, you're a hell of a guy
I mean, my, my, my, my, you're like pelican fly
I mean, you're so shy and I'm loving your tie
You're like slicker than the guy with the thing on his eye, oh
Yes, I did, yes, I did
Somebody please tell em who the F I is
I am Nicki Minaj, I mack them dudes up
Back coupes up and chuck the deuce up
