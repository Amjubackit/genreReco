[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
Look at the stars, look how they shine for you
And everything you do
Yeah, they were all yellow
I came along, I wrote a song for you
And all the things you do
And it was called "Yellow"
So then I took my turn
Oh, what a thing to have done
And it was all yellow
[Chorus 1: Chris Martin, 
Jonny Buckland & Will Champion
]
(
Aah
) Your skin, oh, yeah, your skin and bones
(
Ooh
) Turn into something beautiful
(
Aah
) You know, you know I love you so
You know I love you so
[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I swam across, I jumped across for you
Oh, what a thing to do
'Cause you were all yellow
I drew a line, I drew a line for you
Oh, what a thing to do
And it was all yellow
[Chorus 2: Chris Martin, 
Jonny Buckland & Will Champion
]
(
Aah
) Your skin, oh, yeah, your skin and bones
(
Ooh
) Turn into something beautiful
(
Aah
) And you know, for you, I'd bleed myself dry
For you, I'd bleed myself dry
