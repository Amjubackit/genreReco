This day is gonna be the greatest memory
Making history, let's go
You don't need no luck with that golden touch
Time to light it up, let's go
[Pre-Chorus]
Get ready for it
Get ready for it
Get ready for it
Yeah, this is it

Go, go, go
Yeah, this is it
Go, let 'em know, let's go
(This is it) Yeah, this is it
[Verse 2]
Yeah, it's about to break, got what it's gonna take Go
Ahead and own that stage, let's go
When you're made for this, yeah, it's obvious
Top another list, let's go
[Pre-Chorus]
Get ready for it
Get ready for it
Get ready for it
Yeah, this is it
