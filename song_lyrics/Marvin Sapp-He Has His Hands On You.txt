[Spoken Intro]
[Instrumental Break]
Listen
(He sees) He sees the tears you cry
(And He shares) He shares your pain inside
(And sometimes) And sometimes you wonder why
He allows you to go through what you go through
(Listen) just know He has His hands on you
[?]
(See your days) your days are filled with dark clouds
(Even when the sun is out) even when the sun is out
(And from the top of your lungs) and from the top of your lungs
You shout, will there ever be a change, what shall I do?
Just know He has His hands on you
[Chorus]
He has His hands on you
He says He'll see you through
When you cry, He's holding you
So just lift your hands up high
For He will provide
Just know He has His hands on you
Sometimes you feel so alone
Like a child lost with no home
They keep telling you to be strong
But you say, when will it end, when will I, when will I win?
But just know He has His hands on you, He has His hands on you
