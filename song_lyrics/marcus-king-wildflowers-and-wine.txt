[Verse 1]
Wildflowers and wine
An old scratchy record plays in the background of our lives
We're still here dancing after all this time
Wildflowers and wine
[Verse 2]
I walk through fields of evergreen
A golden sun like I've never seen
I picked them one at a time
Wildflowers and wine
[Chorus]
No, I can't help it (Help it)
Feeling the way I do
I know you feel it
Feel it the same way, too
No, I can't help it (Help it)
You're all I need tonight
You know I mean it
When I look, look in your eyes
[Verse 3]
Wildflowers and wine
Old scratchy record plays in the background of our lives
We're still here dancing after all this time
Wildflowers and wine
[Chorus]
No, I can't help it (Help it)
Feeling the way I do
I know you feel it
Feel it the same way, too
No, I can't help it (Help it)
You're all I need tonight
You know I mean it
When I look, look in your eyes
[Verse 4]
Wildflowers and cheap red wine
Just an old scratchy record plays in the background of our lives
And we're still out here dancing, Lord, after all this time
Wildflowers and wine
[Outro]
We're still out here dancing, Lord, after all this time
Wildflowers, wildflowers and wine
