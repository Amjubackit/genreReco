[Chorus]
Think we can talk it out? Maybe
Or we can talk about your daydreams
Feels like a million miles between you and me
So if you can go without it, I want you to leave
I want you to leave
[Verse]
Take control, and let me know
'Cause I can't stay here, I need to go
If I give you my name, I know I'm sure (About you)
If you play them mind games, I'll show you the door
I'm tryna learn from my mistakes, 'cause I know I only got one more chance
I know you've been burned by all these games, I'm just tryna be a better man
[Chorus]
Think we can talk it out? Maybe
Or we can talk about your daydreams
Feels likе a million miles between you and me
So if you can go without it, I want you to lеave
I want you to leave
[Outro]
Oh my God
Oh my God
Oh my God
Oh my God
Oh my God
Oh my God
