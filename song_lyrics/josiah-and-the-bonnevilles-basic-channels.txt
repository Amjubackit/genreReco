[Verse 1]
When I think of you, I think of growin' old easy
Settlin' down real early in the evenin'
On a twin size mattress in the middle of a snowstorm
Stealin' them covers and keepin' each other warm
[Pre-Chorus]
Lovin' on you 'til we both go six feet
Ain't got much, but we're livin' that big dream
[Chorus]
It's you and me and the basic channels
Yard full of weeds and some beat up flannels
Little house out of town, hunker down through the highs and lows
When the sky comes down, baby, I'm gonna hold you close
It's you and me and the basic channels
[Verse 2]
When I think of you, I think of lettin' go of misery
Turnin' my past into ancient history
A lovе that'll last and a little country baby
Growin' up fast in a world gone crazy
[Chorus]
It's you and me and thе basic channels
Yard full of weeds and some beat up flannels
Little house out of town, hunker down through the highs and lows
When the sky comes down, baby, I'm gonna hold you close
It's you and me and the basic channels[Outro]
All we need are the basic channels
You and me and the basic channels
