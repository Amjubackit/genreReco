[Verse 1]
The door slammed loud and rose up a cloud of dust on us
Footsteps follow down through the hollow sound, torn up
[Chorus 1]
And you will go to Mykonos
With a vision of a gentle coast
And a sun to maybe dissipate
Shadows of the mess you made
[Verse 2]
Pallid animals in the snow-tipped pines I find
Hatching from the seed of your thin mind all night
[Chorus 1]
And you will go to Mykonos
With a vision of a gentle coast
And a sun to maybe dissipate
Shadows of the mess you made
[Verse 3]
Brother, you don't need to turn me away
I was waiting down at the ancient gate
[Chorus 2]
You go
Wherever you go today
You go today
[Verse 4]
I remember how they took you down
As the winter turned the meadow brown
[Chorus 2]
You go
Wherever you go today
You go today
[Verse 5]
When out walking, brother, don't you forget
It ain't often that you'll ever find a friend
[Chorus 2]
You go
Wherever you go today
You go today
[Outro]
You go
Wherever you go today
You go today
You go
Wherever you go today
You go today
You go
Wherever you go today
You go today
You go
Wherever you go today
You go today
You go
Wherever you go today
You go today
You go
Wherever you go today
You go today
