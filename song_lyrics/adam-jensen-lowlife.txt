[Verse 1]
I tried to outrun my addiction
But all I found was a new one
I tried to outlive my affliction
A different bullet but the same gun
[Pre-Chorus]
If it makes you less sad I'll just lay down and die
So you can forget the look deep in my eyes
Goodbye, goodbye
[Chorus]
I'm a lowlife tryna get my head right
Stuck inside a dream
Kickin' ketamine
I'm a lowlife tryna get my head right
I'm too young to die
Ain't too old to cry
[Verse 2]
I think I got some pieces missin'
I'm a puzzle in a minefield (Ooh)
I can't tell if I'm real or fiction
As I'm flyin' through the windshield (Ooh)
[Pre-Chorus]
If it makes you less sad I'll just lay down and die
So you can forget the look deep in my eyes
Goodbye, goodbye[Chorus]
I'm a lowlife tryna get my head right
Stuck inside a dream
Kickin' ketamine
I'm a lowlife tryna get my head right
I'm too young to die
Ain't too old to cry
[Bridge]
I'm cold and alone
I'm on shaky bones
I've loved and I've lost
I'm cold and alone
I'm on shaky bones
I've loved and I've lost
[Chorus]
I'm a lowlife tryna get my head right
Stuck inside a dream
Kickin' ketamine
I'm a lowlife tryna get my head right
I'm too young to die
Ain't too old to cry
