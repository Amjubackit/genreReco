[Intro: Kanye West 
& 
Young Jeezy
]
La, la, la la 
(
Yeah)
Wait 'til I get my money right
[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I had a dream I could buy my way to heaven
When I awoke, I spent that on a necklace
I told God I'd be back in a second
Man, it's so hard not to act reckless
To whom much is given, much is tested
Get arrested, guess until he get the message
I feel the pressure, under more scrutiny
And what I do? Act more stupidly
Bought more jewelry,
 
more Louis V
My mama couldn't get through to me
The drama, people suing me
I'm on TV talking like it's just you and me
I'm just saying how I feel, man
I ain't one of the Cosbys, I ain't go to Hillman
I guess the money should've changed him
I guess I should've forgot where I came from
[Chorus: Kanye West 
& 
Young Jeezy
]
La, la, la la (
Ayy!
)
Wait 'til I get my money right
La, la, la la (
Yeah!
)
Then you can't tell me nothing, right?
Excuse me, was you saying something?
Uh-uh, you can't tell me nothing (
Yeah! Haha!
)
You can't tell me nothing (
Yeah! Yeah!
)
Uh-uh, you can't tell me nothing (
Yeah!
)
