[Verse 1]
6 AM, Mulholland Drive
"Moonlight Sonata" and I
First movement, you and I
And a screwtop bottle of wine
I've unspooled on the floor
I feel so "A Star Is Born"
Kiss my cheek, baby, please
Would you read my eulogy?
[Refrain]
I will never ask you for anything
Except to dream sweet of me
I will never ask you for anything
Except to dream sweet of me
[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me when the party ends
Will you still love who I am?
I am
[Chorus]
Scar-crossed lovers, forever
I'm checking myself out forever
I'm saving this all for later
Scar-crossed lovers, forever
Hеre we are untouchеd forever
I'm saving this all for later, oh[Verse 2]
And they don't know how much they’ll miss
At least until you're gone like this
Talking to the mirror, say, "Save your breath
Half your life you've been hooked on death"
Twice the dreams, but half the love
Be careful what you bottle up
The chemistry is a mess it seems
But me, I'm still a sunbeam
[Refrain]
I will never ask you for anything
Except to dream sweet of me
I will never ask you for anything
Except to dream sweet of me
[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me when the party ends
Will you still love who I am?
I am
[Chorus]
Scar-crossed lovers, forever
I'm checking myself out forever
I'm saving this all for later
Scar-crossed lovers, forever
Here we are untouched forever
I'm saving this all for later[Bridge]
I closed my eyes inside of your darkness
And found your glow
Shake things up, shake things up, shake things up
Shake things up and see what comes down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down
[Chorus]
Scar-crossed lovers, forever
I'm checking myself out forever
I'm saving this all for later
Scar-crossed lovers, forever
Here we are untouched forever
I'm saving this all for later
Scar-crossed lovers, forever
I'm checking myself out forever
I'm saving this all for later
Scar-crossed lovers, forever
Here we are untouched forever
I'm saving this all for later, yeah
