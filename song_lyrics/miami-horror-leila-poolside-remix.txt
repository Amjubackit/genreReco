[Verse 1]
I just can't believe it, you left me here alone
When you coming back now?
Looking in the mirror for all I used to know
I just can't believe it
[Chorus]
Leila, why did you leave again?
Stay home
Leila, can you believe again?
Stay home
[Verse 2]
It's never like the first time, where did it go wrong?
It's always in your head now
I always had to wonder why you let it go
It's never like the first time
[Chorus]
Leila, why did you leave again?
Stay home
Lеila, can you believe again?
Stay homе
[Verse 3]
Been lonely since you left me, when you coming home?
Please come back to bed now
I always had to wonder why you let it go
You drive me into madness[Pre Chorus]
Leila, why did you leave again?
Leila, can you believe again?
[Chorus]
Leila, why did you leave again?
Stay home
Leila, can you believe again?
Stay home
