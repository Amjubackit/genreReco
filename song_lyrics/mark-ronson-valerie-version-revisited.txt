[Spoken Intro: Mark Ronson, 
Amy Winehouse
]
Aight, it's rolling
I'm sorry, Charlie Murphy, I was having too much fun
[Verse 1]
Well, sometimes, I go out by myself
And I look across the water
And I think of all the things, what you're doin'
And in my head, I paint a picture
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause since I've come on home
Well, my body's been a mess
And I've missed your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress
Won't you come on over?
Stop makin' a fool out of me
[Chorus]
Why don't you come on over, Valerie?
Valerie
Valerie
Valerie
[Verse 2]
Did you have to go to jail?
Put your house on up for sale?
Did you get a good lawyer?
Hope you didn't catch a tan
Hope you found the right man
Who'll fix it for you
Are you shoppin' anywhere?
Changed the colour of your hair?
Are you busy?
Or did you have to pay that fine
That you was dodgin' all the time?
Are you still busy?[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause since I've come on home
Well, my body's been a mess
And I've missed your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress
Won't you come on over?
Stop makin' a fool out of me
[Chorus]
Why don't you come on over, Valerie?
Valerie
Valerie
Valerie
[Verse 3]
Well, sometimes, I go out by myself
And I look across the water
And I think of all the things, what you're doin'
And in my head, I paint a picture
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause since I've come on home
Well, my body's been a mess
And I've missed your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress
Won't you come on over?
Stop makin' a fool out of me[Chorus]
Why don't you come on over, Valerie?
Valerie
Valerie
Valerie
Mm, Valerie
Valerie
Valerie
Valerie
[Outro]
Why don't you come on over, Valerie?
