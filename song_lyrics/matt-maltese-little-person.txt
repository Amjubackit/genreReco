[Verse]
I'm just a little person
One person in a sea
Of many little people
Who are not aware of me
I do my little jobs
Live my little life
Eat my little meals
Miss my little kid and wife
[Chorus]
And somewhere, maybe someday
Maybe somewhere far away
I’ll find a second little person
Who will look at me and say
"I know you, you're the one I've waited for
Let’s have some fun"
[Bridge]
Life is precious, every minute
And more precious with you in it
So let's have some fun
We'll take a road trip way out west
You're the one I like the best
I'm glad I found you
I like hangin' 'round you
You're the one I like the best[Outro]
Somewhere, maybe someday
Maybe somewhere far away
Somewhere, maybe someday
Maybe somewhere far away
Somewhere, maybe someday
Maybe somewhere far away
I’ll find a second little person
And we’ll go out and play
