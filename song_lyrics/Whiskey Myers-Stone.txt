[Verse 1]
Well, the night is my 
companion
And the highway is my home
Got me seekin' for one last beacon
Every single place I roam
[Verse 2]
They say Jesus was a poor man
I guess I wish I had a little more of him in me
Make it easier goin' on livin'
Heartache, misery
[Chorus]
Sweet, sweet heart of mine
I'm gonna break again a million times
Or is this too far gone?
Or have you turned to stone?
[Verse 3]
Well, I guess I got my bottle
I still hold it all the time
But it keeps me smilin' and singin'
Helps me fall asleep a little bit better at night
[Verse 4]
They say life is like a dagger
Backstage is full of parasites
They love you and drain you of everything you own
Just to feel better about their life
