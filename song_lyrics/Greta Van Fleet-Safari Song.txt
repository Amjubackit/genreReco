[Intro]
Ah yeah
[Verse 1]
Oh, lady, when you come on down
Won't you come on down
I said, to my town?
Oh, mama, when you come on down
Won't you come on down
I said, to my home?
Oh, lady, won't you move my way?
Can't you move my way?
I'm getting hazy
Oh, mama, when you give your lovin'
When you give your love
You drive me crazy
[Chorus]
Ah, mama, what you gonna do
With all that love in your heart?
Ah, mama, what you gotta say
About that love in your heart?
Oh, mama, when you walk this way
Why don't you give some lovin'?
Oh, mama, what you gonna do
With all that lovin' in your heart?
