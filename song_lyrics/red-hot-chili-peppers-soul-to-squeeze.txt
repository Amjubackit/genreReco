[Verse 1]
I got a bad disease
Up from my brain is where I bleed
Insanity it seems
Has got me by my soul to squeeze
Well all the love from me
With all the dying trees I scream
The angels in my dreams, yeah
Have turned to demons of greed, that's mean
[Chorus]
Where I go, I just don't know
I got to, got to, gotta take it slow
When I find my peace of mind
I'm gonna give you some of my good time
[Verse 2]
Today love smiled on me
It took away my pain, said please
Iâ€™ll let your ride be free
You gotta let it be, oh yeah
[Chorus]
Where I go, I just don't know
I got to, gotta, gotta take it slow
When I find my peace of mind
I'm gonna give you some of my good time
