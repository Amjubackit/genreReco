[Intro]
Let's just stop
Drop everything
(Forget each other's names) Forget each other's names
And just walk away
[Verse 1]
Turn around and head in different directions
Like we never, it's like we never knew each other at all
We say what we feel, then we stop ourselves
And just walk away
Never looking back
Loving every second of it
We just walk away
[Chorus]
This is probably the best
Not to mention the worst idea
That I have ever had
[Verse 2]
Ignoring what we've felt
Overlooking what we've done
No awkward silences, no hiding any truths
Ignoring what we've felt
Overlooking what we've done
What do you say?[Chorus]
This is probably the best
Not to mention the worst idea
That I have ever had
[Verse 3]
We say what we feel
Then we stop ourselves
And just walk away
Never looking back
Loving every second of it
We just walk away
[Bridge]
Let's just stop
Drop everything
Forget each other's names
Can we please just walk away?
It could be...It could be...
Like we never knew each other at all
Walk away!
All egos aside, what do you say?
All egos aside, what do you say?
[Verse 4]
Ignoring what we've felt
Overlooking what we've done
No awkward silences, no hiding any truths
Ignoring what we've felt
Overlooking what we've done
What do you say?[Outro]
We say what we feel
Then we stop ourselves
And just walk away
Never looking back
Loving every second of it
We just walk away
We just walk away
