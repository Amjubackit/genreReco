[Verse 1]
Wait another minute, can't you see
What this pain has fuckin' done to me?
I'm alive and still kickin', what you see, I can't see
And maybe you'll think before you speak
[Chorus]
I'm alive, for you
I'm awake, because of you
I'm alive, told you
I'm awake, swallowin' you
[Verse 2]
Take another second, turn your back on me
And make-believe that you're always happy
It's safe to say, you're never alive, a big part of you has died
And by the way, I hope you're satisfied
[Chorus]
I'm alive, for you
I'm awake, because of you
I'm alive, told you
I'm awake, swallowin' you
I'm alive, for you
I'm awake, because of you
I'm alive, told you
I'm awake
