[Chorus]
Tellin' all the stars her name
Hopin' they just tell her "hey", and
I love ya, baby
I love ya, baby
Runnin' all through my brain
Wishin' that I could stay
And just hold you, baby
Just to hold ya, baby
[Verse 1]
Lookin' down from my orbit
Captain, can you get her to call me?
Though I may be far gone
Know that she's my only desire
Stay in her arms
Where the moon is shaded
Lose control and I
Might go crazy
[Pre-Chorus]
Air is gone so
Now I'm never comin' home
Air is gone so
Now I'm never comin' home[Chorus]
Tellin' all the stars her name
Hopin' they just tell her "hey", and
I love ya, baby
And I love ya, baby
Runnin' all through my brain
Wishin' that I could stay
And just hold you, baby
Just to hold ya, baby
[Verse 2]
Gravity is so crazy
It's the only way I ever could touch you
Captain, can you hear me?
I wish I was the one that told you
Stuck in moon dust
Try to call my baby
Tried to reach her but
Now it's goin' hazy
[Pre-Chorus]
Air is gone so
Now I'm never comin' home
Air is gone so
Now I'm never comin' home[Chorus (Extended)]
Tellin' all the stars her name
Hopin' they just tell her "hey", and
I love ya, baby
And I love ya, baby
Runnin' all through my brain
Wishin' that I could stay
And just hold you, baby
Just to hold ya, baby
Tellin' all the stars her name
Hopin' they just tell her "hey"
And I love you, baby
And I love ya, baby
Runnin' all through my brain
Wishin' that I could stay
And just hold you, baby
[Outro]
I can't let ya, I can't let ya
I can't let you go, baby
I can't let ya, I can't let ya
I can't let you go
Baby, baby
Don't you love me?
Baby, please
But please feel me, darling
[?] please
