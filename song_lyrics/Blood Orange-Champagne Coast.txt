[Verse 1]
Finishing eight or nine?
Tell me, what's the perfect time?
Told you I'll be waiting
Hiding from the rainfall
[Hook]
Come into my bedroom
Come into my bedroom
Come into my bedroom
Come into my bedroom
[Verse 2]
Tell me, what's the joy of giving if you're never pleased?
On my last strength against all that you believed
[Hook]
Come into my bedroom
Come into my bedroom
Come into my bedroom
Come into my bedroom
[Verse 3]
Young as I want to know
I'll never let you go
Trading a baseball lover as I face the snow
