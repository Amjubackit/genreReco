[Verse 1]
Taking it slow, saving up, she
Before she knows it, all I ask before she goes home
She's tired of crying and sick of his lies
She's suffered him for far too many years of her life
Feeling low and scared that he'll say
Do you know how, over time, you drove her away?
Saving up for the day when she goes
The day that she stands up for everything that she chose
[Chorus]
She can say, she can say
She can say, she can say
She can say, she can say
Who knows what she's gonna say?
She can say, she can say
She can say, she can say
She can say, she can say
Who knows what she's gonna say?
She can say, she can say
She can say, she can say
She can say, she can say
Who knows what she's gonna say?
She can say, she can say
She can say, she can say
She can say, she can say
Who knows what she's gonna say?
She can say
