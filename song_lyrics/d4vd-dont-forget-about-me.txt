[Chorus]
Tell me it was all in your head
Don't tell me you forgot about me
Don't tell me you forgot about me
Don't tell me you forgot about me
Tell me I'd be better off dead
But don't tell me you forgot about me
Don't tell me you forgot about me
Don't tell me you forgot about me
[Verse]
'Cause I don't wanna relive this feelin' of alone
And I don't wanna keep cryin' on your shoulder
Swear I thought we'd be together 'til we're older
Too many thoughts inside my head, thеy're spillin' over
[Pre-Chorus]
Stay for me, can you say somеthin'?
Take me away, baby
But I'm holdin' my tongue 'cause it's over now
[Chorus]
Tell me it was all in your head
Don't tell me you forgot about me
Don't tell me you forgot about me
Don't tell me you forgot about me
Tell me I'd be better off dead
But don't tell me you forgot about me
Don't tell me you forgot about me
Don't tell me you forgot about me
