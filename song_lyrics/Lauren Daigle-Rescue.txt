[Verse 1]
You are not hidden
There’s never been a moment
You were forgotten
You are not hopeless
Though you have been broken
Your innocence stolen
[Pre-Chorus 1]
I hear you whisper underneath your breath
I hear your SOS, your SOS
[Chorus 1]
I will send out an army
To find you in the middle of darkest night
It’s true
I will rescue you
[Verse 2]
There is no distance
That cannot be covered
Over and over
You’re not defenseless
I’ll be your shelter
I’ll be your armor
