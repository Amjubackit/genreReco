[Verse 1]
Oh, I’m headed to the mountains
I’ll be back in a week or two
Don’t you try to reach me 'cause I won’t pick up for you
I’ve got some things I need to do
[Interlude]
Hmmmm
[Verse 2]
Oh I’m headed to the mountains
Where the air is sweet and new
Don’t you try to reach me 'cause I don’t want to talk to you
I’ve got some thinking to do
[Chorus]
I’m trying to let go
I think it could help being alone
And I’m trying not to let you make me cry
I’ve spilled too many tears
And I think I deserve to be alone
[Bridge]
And don’t you try to reach me while I pick myself up and go
I’ve got to do this on my own
I need to build myself a home
