[Bridge 1: Lil Jon]
If you ain't getting drunk, get the fuck out the club
If you ain't taking shots, get the fuck out the club
If you ain't come to party, get the fuck out the club
Now where my alcoholics? Let me see yo' hands up (What you drinkin' on?)
Jägerbombs,
 
Lemondrops
Buttery Nipples,
 
Jello shots
Kamikaze,
 
Three Wise Men
Fuck all that shit, give me some gin[Verse 3: Redfoo & 
Lil Jon
]
Shots
Patrón's on the rocks and I'm ready for some shots
The women come around every time I'm pouring shots
Their panties hit the ground every time I give 'em shots
So cups in the air, everybody, let's take shots
[Bridge 2: Redfoo]
If you feeling drunk, put yo' hands in the air
And if you tryna fuck, put yo' hands in the air
Now say, "I'm fucked up" (I'm fucked up)
I'm fucked up (I'm fucked up)
I'm tryna fuck (I'm tryna fuck)
I'm tryna fuck (I'm tryna fuck)
[Verse 4: LMFAO]
Shots
Patrón's on the rocks and I'm ready for some shots
The women come around every time I'm pouring shots
Their panties hit the ground every time I give 'em shots
So cups in the air, everybody, let's take shots
I'm fucked up (Let's go)
