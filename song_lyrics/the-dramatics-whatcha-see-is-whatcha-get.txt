[Verse 1]
Hey, some people are made of plastic
And you know, some people are made of wood
Some people have hearts of stone
Some people 
(Some people)
Are up to no good, ah
But baby, I'm for real
I'm as real as real can get
If what you're looking for is real lovin'
Then what you see is what you get
Ha!
[Chorus]
Whatcha see 
(Whatcha see)
Is whatcha get 
(Is whatcha get)
Whatcha see 
(Whatcha see)
Is whatcha get 
(Is what you get)
I said, what you see 
(Whatcha see)
Is whatcha get now, baby 
(Is what you get)
And the real thing 
(The real thing)
Is the best thing yet 
(The best thing yet)
[Verse 2]
(You know)
Some people are made of lies 
(Ooh, ooh, ah-ah)
To bring you down and shame your name 
(Ooh, ooh, ah-ah)
But baby, I have good intentions 
(Good intentions)
'Cause breakin' hearts just ain't my game 
(Breakin' hearts ain't my game)
All I want to do is love you
And sugar, I won't fill you with regret, no, no, ow
If what you're looking for is real lovin' 
(Real lovin')
Then what you see is what you get
I got to say it again, ha!
