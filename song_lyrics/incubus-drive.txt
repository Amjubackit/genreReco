[Verse 1]
Sometimes I feel the fear of uncertainty, stinging clear
And I, I can't help but ask myself, how much I let the fear take the wheel and steer
[Pre-Chorus 1]
It's driven me before, and it seems to have a vague
Haunting mass appeal
But lately I'm beginning to find that I
Should be the one behind the wheel
[Chorus]
Whatever tomorrow brings I’ll be there
With open arms and open eyes, yeah
Whatever tomorrow brings I’ll be there
I’ll be there
, 
yeah, ohh
[Verse 2]
So if I decide to waiver my chance to be one of the hive
Will I choose water over wine, and hold my own and drive?
Ohh-oh-ohh
[Pre-Chorus 2]
It's driven me before, and it seems to be the way
That everyone else gets around
But lately I'm beginning to find that when I
Drive myself my light is found[Chorus]
And whatever tomorrow brings I’ll be there
With open arms and open eyes, yeah
Whatever tomorrow brings I’ll be there
I’ll be there
, 
yeah, ohh
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge]
Would you choose the water over wine?
Hold the wheel and drive
[Chorus]
Whatever tomorrow brings I’ll be there
With open arms and open eyes, yeah
Whatever tomorrow brings I’ll be there
I’ll be there
, 
yeah, ohh
[Outro]
Do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do
Whoa-oh-oh, do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do
Who-a-oh-oh-oh-oh
