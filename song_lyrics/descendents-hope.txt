[Verse 1]
Why can't you see you torture me?
You're already thinking about someone else
When he comes home, you'll be in his arms and I'll be gone
[Chorus]
But I know my day will come
I know someday, I'll be the only one
[Verse 2]
So now you wait for his spark, you know it'll turn you on
He's gonna make you feel the way you want to feel
When he starts to lie, when he makes you cry
[Chorus]
You know I'll be there, my day will come
I know someday, I'll be the only one
[Bridge]
Call me selfish, call me what you like to think is right
To want someone for all your own and not to share her love
'Cause I'll have my way, you won't have a say anyway
'Cause I've got you, you don't stand a chance
[Verse 3]
So now you wait for his 
cock
, you know it'll turn you on
He's gonna make you feel the way you want to feel
When he starts to lie, when he makes you cry[Chorus]
You know I'll be there, my day will come
I know someday, I'll be the only one
My day will come
I know someday, I'll be the only one
[Outro]
So now you want perfection
I see your self destruction
You don't know what you want
It's gonna take you years to find out
I'm not giving up
And when you've had enough
You'll take your bruised little head and you'll come
Running back to me
You know that I'm gonna be the only one
(I'm gonna be the only one)
