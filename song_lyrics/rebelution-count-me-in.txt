Now I gotta make my rounds
Where can I lay you down?
I’m gonna miss your love tonight
You know I really love your sound
Where can I leave you now?
I’m gonna miss your love tonight
Well I say hey
Count me in
Always
That’s all I wanted
Was to say
Always
Maybe in another life
You I tried to find
But all had been neglected
And you’re so true to form
Nah you know I can’t ignore
The way that we connected
Well I say hey
Count me in
Always
That’s all I wanted
Was to say
AlwaysWell I say hey
Count me in
Always
That’s all I wanted
Was to say
Always
