[Verse 1]
How I long to breathe the air of Heaven
Where pain is gone and mercy fills the streets
To look upon the One who bled to save me
To walk with Him for all eternity
[Chorus]
Oh, there will be a day when all will bow before Him
There will be a day when death will be no more
Standing face to face with He who died and rose again
Holy, holy is the Lord
[Verse 2]
Every prayer we've prayed in despеration
The songs of faith we’ve sang through doubt and fеar
But in the end, we'll see that it was worth it
When He returns to wipe away our tears
[Chorus]
Oh, there will be a day when all will bow before Him
There will be a day when death will be no more
Standing face to face with He who died and rose again
Holy, holy is the Lord
[Verse 3]
On the day we join the resurrection
And stand beside the hero's of the faith
With one voice, a thousand generations
Sing worthy is the Lamb who was slain
Forever He shall reign[Chorus]
Oh, there will be a day when all will bow before Him
There will be a day when death will be no more
Standing face to face with He who died and rose again
Holy, holy is the Lord
So let it be today we shout the hymn of Heaven
With angels and the saints we raise a mighty roar
Glory to our God who gave us life beyond the grave
Holy, holy is the Lord
So there will be a day when all will bow before Him
There will be a day when death will be no more
Standing face to face with He who died and rose again
Holy, holy is the Lord
[Verse 3]
On the day we join the resurrection
And stand beside the hero’s of the faith
And with one voice, a thousand generations
Sing worthy is the Lamb who was slain
Forever He shall reign
And on the day we join the resurrection
And stand beside the hero's of the faith
And with one voice, a thousand generations
Sing worthy is the Lamb who was slain
Forever He shall reign[Chorus]
Oh, there will be a day when all will bow before Him
There will be a day when death will be no more
Standing face to face with He who died and rose again
Holy, holy is the Lord
So let it be today we shout the hymn of Heaven
With angels and the saints we raise a mighty roar
Glory to our God who gave us life beyond the grave
Holy, holy is the Lord
Holy, holy is the Lord
