[Verse 1]
Do you ever go to sleep
Wondering if you're gonna wake up
And you're lying
Dreamin, I'm dreamin I'm dying
Drift away into the deep
Wandering out there in darkness
And I'm crying
Screamin', I'm screamin' I'm dying
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm a dreamer, I'm a man
I'm doing whatever I can to make the bad things go away
When I'm beat up and alone
I feel it wherever I go, It's like a poison in my veins
Everyday I wonder
Maybe when I'm six feet under
[Chorus]
Someone help me
Screamin' out
I'm down on my knees
This will be the death of me
I feel it in my bones
The devils at my door
So help me
This will be the death of me[Verse 2]
Close my eyes and feel the heat
Keeping my head up when I'm walking through the fire
Filling me with the desire
See the chains around my feet
Wondering if I'm gonna wake up
And be flying
It's killing me, killing me trying
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm a dreamer, I'm a man
I'm doing whatever I can to make the bad things go away
When I'm beat up and alone
I feel it wherever I go, It's like a poison in my veins
Everyday I wonder
Maybe when I'm six feet under
[Chorus]
Someone help me
Screamin' out
I'm down on my knees
This will be the death of me
I feel it in my bones
The devils at my door
So help me
This will be the death of me[Bridge]
My soul's vibrating
I'm levitating
[Chorus]
Someone help me
Screamin' out (I'm down on my knees)
I feel it in my bones
The devils at my door
So help me
This will be the death of me
[Chorus]
Someone help me
Screamin' out
I'm down on my knees
This will be the death of me
I feel it in my bones
The devils at my door
So help me
This will be the death of me
