[Verse 1]
Without no iPhone
Me have a likkle, Blackberry
To keep the lights on
Me touchin road  early
[Pre-Chorus]
Is that why have no option?
Why
Trappin' in the slums?
Why
Black man sellin' it?
Why
[Chorus]
Me have me nine always
Keep it by my waist
Me keep it for protection
Me have me gun always
Keep it by my waist
The 
nina
, no option
Me have me nine always
Keep it by my waist
Me keep it for protection
Me have me gun always
Keep it by my waist
The 
nina
, no option
