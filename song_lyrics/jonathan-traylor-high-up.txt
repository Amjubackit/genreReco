[Verse 1]
People always tryna bring you down
They be throwing stones like it's going out of style
Seeking for the ones they can devour, yeah
But you can't let 'em have it, you can't let 'em take that power
Don't forget who you were made to be, be
Royal priesthood you're a child of the King
Don't give in to negativity
Just keep smiling in the face of all your enemies
[Chorus]
You can't bring me down, I'm way too high up, high up
Thoughts above the clouds, I'm caught in Your love, Your love
And nothing that you say can change a thing
There's a greater voice affirming me
You can't bring me down I'm way too high up, high up
High
[Verse 2]
People always got a lot to say
World full of noise, voices drowning by the day
Everything is up for debate
She say, he say, we say, can't nobody get it straight
Don't forget who you were made to be
Royal priesthood you're a child of the King
Don't give in to negativity
Just keep elevating above all your enemies
