[Intro]
Mmm, oh
Higher, higher
Saying higher-er-er-er, ayy
[Verse 1]
Tell me why you're crying now kini big deal
When you gave me something I don't really feel
But you knew that already
When I found you on the ground you were dying
Now why you come into my yard, uninvited?
Can you see me on the edge? I'm enlightened
[Chorus]
If the world was ending
Would you cry or would you try to get me?
Tell me now, I want you to be clear, yeah
Tell me now, I need you to be clеar, yeah
I will wait for you, for you
I will wait for you, I will wait for you
[Verse 2]
Get me, can you put thе time on a rewind, yeah
Help me understand, can you tell me now
Why you made the war that we're fighting now
And you fall and you run when you see my big guns
Run around, run away as the rebel comes out
Then you call, call on me when you call me I come
But there you go again[Verse 3]
With your deaf ears
Open your mind to the sound of the trumpet
What do you want from a life of the hopeless
Now here you are, you're begging and crying
I want to fly, yeah, I'm flying till morning
Running away to the land of discovery
Running away from the suffering, I'm gone, yeah
Running away from the darkness, I'm out here, yeah
[Chorus]
Higher than all the limits
Going way beyond the noise and your feelings
When you speak all I can hear is silence
Running back from all the pain and violence
Big tunes, now it's big tunes I'm killing
Cry now from the side now, call my name
Fall down when you see me, you know that
You know that I will stay for you
I will wait for you, for you
I will wait for you, I will wait for you
