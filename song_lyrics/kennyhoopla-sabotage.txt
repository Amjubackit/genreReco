[Verse 1]
I'm coming to terms with death and the stages of grief
In the town that I'm from, you're lucky to make it this far
Show 'em the light and it goes bad, they all go blind
I'm not positive I'm in love, but I know I'm your type
[Pre-Chorus]
The pictures never do justice
Pictures never do justice
[Chorus]
Always find another way to ruin things
Through suffering and sabotage
As if this life was ever in your odds
It takes so long to fall apart
[Verse 2]
And all this hate is institutional
His heart is ruined from your sorrow
Her architecture always facial
A humble building 'til it crumbles
[Pre-Chorus]
The pictures nevеr do justice
The pictures nеver do justice[Chorus]
Always find another way to ruin things (Ruin things)
Through suffering (Suffering), and sabotage
As if this life was ever in your odds (In your odds)
It takes so long (It takes so long), to fall apart
[Bridge]
It's like the whole world
Went and jumped on top of my shoulders
Haunted houses that
I'm never scared to walk through with you
[Chorus]
Always find another way to ruin things (Always find another way)
Through suffering (Suffering), and sabotage
As if this life was ever in your odds (In your odds)
It takes so long (It takes so long), to fall apart
[Outro]
Always find another way to ruin things (Always find another way)
Through suffering (Suffering), and sabotage
As if this life was ever in your odds (In your odds)
It takes so long (It takes so long), to fall apart
