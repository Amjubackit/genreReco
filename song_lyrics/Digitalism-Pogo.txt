[Chorus]
Yeah, woah-oh
There's somethin' in the air, oh
There's somethin' in the air
There's somethin' in the air
[Verse 1]
Now where has it been?
I mean the good old wild days
Became a bit too lame
Just take a look at my place
It's such a mess
But I'll be out of this space
As soon as you tell me where the night is
[Pre-Chorus]
You have to set up
Bring it on
Forward
[Chorus]
Yeah, woah-oh
There's somethin' in the air, woah-oh
There's somethin' in the air, woah-oh
There's somethin' in the air
