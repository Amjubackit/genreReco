[Verse 1]
When you ask how I've been
I know you mean well, I know you mean well
Who am I dialing tonight? That's a bummer
Thaw out my freezer burn feelings for twenty summers
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm just a cherub riding comets through the night sky
Screaming at the stars like night lights
And I love my life, love my life
Running middle fingers through the red lights
And I guess I'm getting older 'cause I'm less pissed
When I can't get onto the guest list
To the end of the world, the end of the world
Fever-dream tangerine sweat
When I get down, down
Silent killers are these years coming like waves
(You put the "fun" into dysfunction)
[Chorus]
Hold me, hold me like a grudge
The world is always spinning, and I can't keep up, woah
Faster and faster, can't do it on my own
Part-time soulmate, full-time problem, yeah
So, hold me like a grudge
[Post-Chorus]
Hold me like a grudge, yeah, yeah
Hold me like a grudge
Hold me like a grudge
[Verse 2]
I guess, somehow, we made it back
And with a few dreams of ours still intact
I am a diamond on the inside, just add the pressure
Know it's inside me but I got no map to my own treasure
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm just a cherub riding comets through the night sky
Screaming at the stars like night lights
And I love my life, love my life
Running middle fingers through the red lights
And I guess I'm getting older 'cause I'm less pissed
We didn't make to your year-end best list
Not the end of the world, the end of the world
Fever-dream tangerine sweat
When I get down, down
Silent killers are these years coming like waves
(You put the "fun" into dysfunction)
[Chorus]
Hold me, hold me like a grudge
The world is always spinning, and I can't keep up, woah
Faster and faster, can't do it on my own
Part-time soulmate, full-time problem, yeah
So, hold me like a grudge
[Post-Chorus]
Hold me like a grudge, yeah, yeah
Hold me like a grudge
Hold me like a grudge
[Bridge]
I thought I knew better, I thought it would get better
I figured somehow by now, I would have got it together
And if you put your, put your heart in it, heart in it
Then we'll do more than just get by together, yeah
Call you up and demand, you have no fun without me
I'm like a storm on the horizon, storm on the horizon
(You put the "fun" into dysfunction)
[Chorus]
Hold me, hold me like a grudge
The world is always spinning, and I can't keep up, woah
Faster and faster, can't do it on my own
Part-time soulmate, full-time problem, yeah
Hold me like a grudge
[Outro]
Hold me like a grudge (Hold me), yeah, yeah
Hold me like a grudge (Hold me, hold)
Hold me like a grudge (Hold me like a)
Hold me like a grudge
