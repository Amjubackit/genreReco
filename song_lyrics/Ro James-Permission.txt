[Verse 1]
Ooh-uh
With your permission
I just wanna spend a little time with you
With your permission
Tonight I wanna be a little me on you
Ooh yeah
With your permission
I wanna spend the night sipping on you
[Pre-Hook]
You know what I'm talking about baby, yeah
Now it's time for you to show me what it's hitting for
Sip a little jack, maybe blow a little dro
Love you from behind, but I hate to see you go
[Hook]
Ooh-oh
Come on give me that green light
You can let your hair hang down
Well only if it feels right
Oho, give me that green light
I need you, to give me that green light
[Verse 2]
With your permission
I just wanna put a little smile on you
With your permission
There's a whole lot of motherfuckin' lovin' that's way past due
I owe you
With your permission
I'ma do all the things that I said I'm gonna do
