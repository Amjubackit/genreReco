[Intro]
You got Woods in here? Backwoods
(Backwoods)
[Chorus]
It ain't no Backwoods on this side of town
Wanna ride with me to get some more?
Pick a couple of Wild Irish Roses (Roses)
You lookin' mm-mm-mm delectable
Made arrangements for that edible
Double booked, it's cool, your friend can roll through
Casa su casa, how's yo' Spanish?
You kick it off, home field advantage
Got Gatorade on ice, lil' boo, stay cool
Second stop we done made
Can't find no Woods and it's gettin' late
I might just pull over
Mm-mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm-mm
[Verse]
Lil shawty got me standin' at attention
Cuidado
This that two-a-day bench press repetition
Equinox, oops, I mean Equinox
Smeezy F Baby and the F is for Faneto
Triangles, down, up, circle
My dick a cheat code, I stick for the joy
She sayin' it's sweet, callin' me chico
I dig in her earth deep and she quakin'
I'm from Jupiter, baby, get with an alien
Crazy, I popped a little somethin'
I'm seein' 3D (Ooh)
We saw Nefertiti, you won't believe me (Ooh)
Posted up like a lamp, come rub on a genie
I know you wish for forever, ever, you see me
My stones rolling, but fuck it, you rockin' with me
Yeah, you rockin' with me
Somethin' 'bout your lil' convo, you do somethin' for me
And I ain't cold with geometry, but you a cute mothafucka
[Chorus]
It ain't no Backwoods on this side of town
Wanna ride with me to get some more?
Pick a couple of Wild Irish Roses (Roses)
You lookin' mm-mm-mm delectable
Made arrangements for that edible
Double booked if it's cool, your friend can roll through
Casa su casa, how's yo' Spanish?
You kick it off, home field advantage
Got Gatorade on ice, lil' boo, stay cool
Second stop we done made
Can't find no Woods and it's gettin' late
I might just pull over
Mm-mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm-mm
[Outro]
It ain't no Backwoods on this side of town
Wanna ride with me to get some more?
Pick a couple of Wild Irish Roses
