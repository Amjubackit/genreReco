Mama don't you know how much I miss you
But I am stronger, stronger now
All these children cold faces Lord they followed me some how
I got to get away right now
Mama ain't a day goes by I don't think about him
Well I can see his face still
Dull grey eyes burnt out to ash Lord to hell and gone again
I got to get away from him
I'm walking on moonlight
Walking in the starlight place in my mind
Walking on moonlight in the day
Sipping on dew drops
Float above the green treetops and it all
Walking on moonlight in the day
I'm walking on moonlight
Walking in the starlight place in my mind
Walking on moonlight in the day
Sipping on dew drops
Float above the green treetops and it all
Walking on moonlight in the day
