[Verse 1]
Hold up!
It's the motherfuckin' concrete, suicidal nightshift
Loaded with a vice grip, poppin' all you copies who keep waterin' down shit
Thinking you can rap with that artificial outfit
Your baggy pants and your bottle of crack hits, fuck all of that shit!
Fuck all of you posers! Let go of the mic, kid
And step into a world that you never seen
When I'm fiendin' for a microphone, I'm a microphone fiend
[Pre-Chorus]
(Mic, mic, microphone fiend)
(Mic-mic, mic, microphone fiend)
(Mic, microphone fiend, fiend, fiend)
[Verse 2]
Bring on the motherfuckin' cutthroat, 
territorial piss off
Spit the deadly and ready for lift-off
Who's getting their shit tossed?
Is it the one kid running his mouth that he's sucking his thumb with?!
You're damn straight! I'll put it right in 'em
No anti-venom for the buck-buck!
See a world that you never seen
When I'm fiendin' for a microphone, I'm a microphone fiend
[Pre-Chorus]
(Mic, mic, microphone fiend)
(Mic-mic, mic, microphone fiend)
(Mic, microphone fiend, fiend, fiend)[Chorus]
Gimme a motherfuckin' mic, y'all, gimme a mic, y'all
Gimme a mic so I can rock it right, y'all
I'm out of sight, y'all, I'm out of sight, y'all
I'm out of sight when I'm blowin' up the mic, y'all
You know it!
You know it!
[Verse 3]
Hold up!
Check out the motherfuckin' TV
The same songs, same bands everyday, fuck that!
I'll blow those motherfuckers away!
You wantin' to hear some heavy ass metal
That can penetrate deep into your ear drums?
Turn it up, motherfucker! Turn it up, motherfucker! Turn it up!
And step into a world that you never seen
When I'm fiendin' for a microphone, I'm a microphone fiend
[Pre-Chorus]
(Mic-mic, microphone fiend)
(Microphone fien-fiend)
(Mic, mic, microphone fiend, fiend, fiend)
[Chorus]
Gimme a motherfuckin' mic, y'all, gimme a mic, y'all
Gimme a mic so I can rock it right, y'all
I'm out of sight, y'all, I'm out of sight, y'all
I'm out of sight when I'm blowin' up the mic, y'all
You know it!
You know it![Bridge]
It's a crazy, crazy world playing crazy, crazy shit
On this crazy radio, I'm really sick of it
I'm a crazy, crazy man with a crazy, crazy plan
To destroy all you crazy ass wannabe ba-ba-ba-bands, ha-ha!
[Chorus]
Gimme a motherfuckin' mic, y'all, gimme a mic, y'all
Gimme a mic so I can rock it right, y'all
I'm out of sight, y'all, I'm out of sight, y'all
I'm out of sight when I'm blowin' up the mic, y'all
Gimme a mic, y'all (Yeah!), gimme a mic, y'all (Yeah!)
Gimme a mic so I can rock it right, y'all (Yeah!)
I'm out of sight, y'all (What?), I'm out of sight, y'all (What?)
I'm out of sight when I'm blowin' up the mic, y'all
You know it!
