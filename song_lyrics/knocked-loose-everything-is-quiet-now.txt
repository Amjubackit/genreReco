[Verse 1: Bryan Garris, Isaac Hale and Both]
If I were God, I'd blind the youth
The gnawing weight of final night
To all the pain that hides in truth
Unwilling, I have been fed to life
Bellowing for just a crumb
Static in the constant hum
To drink from life's flowing stream
Poisoned
[Verse 2: Bryan Garris, Isaac Hale and Both]
Upon loss
Upon loss, we're reminded of Hell
Existence of pain and free will
Denial
A cancer that eats at the shell (Lost forever)
Loss
Upon loss, lives denial
Upon loss, how can I move on now?
[Breakdown: Bryan Garris and Bryan Garris & Isaac Hale]
Are you washed in, in the blood? (Are you washed in the blood?)
It sinks in it's teeth
It comes for us all (I can't see the roots of his shadow)
Are you washed in, in thе blood?
It comes for me in the dеad of night
In the dead of night
[Outro: Bryan Garris]
I was visited by death again
Upon loss
Everything is quiet now
