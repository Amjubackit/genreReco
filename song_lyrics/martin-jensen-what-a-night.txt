[Verse 1]
I'm on a whole 'another level
Lose myself in flashing lights
One touch of you is like heaven
The crowd is freaking out till five
[Pre-Chorus]
Never seen such a night with my own eyes
'Cause we're breaking the silence with love
Running circles it never felt so right
I can't hold it back no more
[Chorus]
What a magic, what a night
Take me to your paradise
I don't know a lot but, I know I'm alright
As long as I got you
What a magic, what a night
Like we're legends in the sky
I don't know a lot but, I know I'm alright
As long as I got you
[Drop]
[Pre-Chorus]
Never seen such a night with my own eyes
'Cause we're breaking the silence with love
Running circles it never felt so right
I can't hold it back no more
[Chorus]
What a magic, what a night
Take me to your paradise
I don't know a lot but, I know I'm alright
As long as I got you
What a magic, what a night
Like we're legends in the sky
I don't know a lot but, I know I'm alright
As long as I got you
[Bridge]
As long as I got you
As long as I got you
As long as I got you
As long as I got you
As long as I got you
As long as I got you
As long as I got you
As long as I got you
As long as I got you
As long as I got you!
[Chorus]
What a magic, what a night
Take me to your paradise
I don't know a lot but I know I'm alright
As long as I got you
What a magic, what a night
Like we're legends in the sky
I don't know a lot but I know I'm alright
As long as I got you
