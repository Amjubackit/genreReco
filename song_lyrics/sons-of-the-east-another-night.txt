[Verse 1]
There's a light in the ocean, in my eyes
As I ride the burning skies
20 miles and dirty smiles in my way
I'm on the road half the day
I heard a voice from inside, rattling my ears
I heard it all crystal clear
There's heavy smoke in my eyes breaking up my view
Still I got the shape of you
[Chorus]
Another night I had you living in my head
And I'm trying to work it out
Another night without you, wishing you were there
And I'm going down
Yeah, I'm going down
[Verse 2]
All my nights are blurry
Cold water is yet to wait
And many things I've gotta say
Holes up in my pockеt and mud all on my shoes
I think I need a drink or two
Memories comе rolling, falling out like tears
Lonely times, lonely years
'Cause all I ever wanted is another time with you
What the hell you put me through?[Chorus]
Another night I had you living in my head
And I'm trying to work it out
Another night without you, wishing you were there
And I'm going down
Yeah, I'm going down
Another night I had you living in my head
And I'm trying to work it out
Another night without you, wishing you were there
And I'm going down
Yeah I, I'm going down
[Outro]
There's a light in the ocean, in my eyes
As I ride the burning skies
