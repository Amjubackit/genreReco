[Verse 1]
Oh, my heart needs some headspace
Every night try to escape
Got me calling for your name
Feel you touching
[Pre-Chorus]
You take me to a place only we know
Away from all the noise and the people
You take me to a place only we know
When I hear your voice
Say the word and we'll go
[Chorus]
'Cause darling when we pull close
I know we call pull through
I just wanna let go (Let go) of everything but you
'Cause nothing even matters
If it's me you're holding on to
I just wanna lеt go of everything but you
Everything but you
[Post-Chorus]
Evеrything but you
[Verse 2]
I'm so tired of the hollow
Show me signs I can follow
Baby, I go where you go
Don't you know that[Pre-Chorus]
You take me to a place only we know
When I hear your voice
Say the word and we'll go
[Chorus]
'Cause darling when we pull close
I know we call pull through
I just wanna let go of everything but you
'Cause nothing even matters
If it's me you're holding on to
I just wanna let go of everything but you
Everything but you
[Bridge]
If I lose, if I'm losing myself tonight
I'll be fine if I'm finding me by your side
If I lose, if I'm losing myself it'll be alright
[Chorus]
'Cause darling when we pull close
I know we call pull through
I just wanna let go of everything but you
Everything but you
(Everything but you)
(Everything but you)[Outro]
Everything but you
