[Intro]
[Chorus: The Raelettes, 
Ray Charles
]
Hit the road Jack, and don't ya come back
No more, no more, no more, no more
Hit the road Jack, and don't ya come back no more
What'd you say?
Hit the road Jack, and don't ya come back
No more, no more, no more, no more
Hit the road Jack, and don't ya come back no more
[Verse 1: Ray Charles, 
The Raelettes
]
Old woman old woman, don't treat me so mean
You're the meanest old woman that I've ever seen
I guess if you say so
I'll have to pack my things and go (
That's right
)
[Chorus: The Raelettes, 
Ray Charles
]
Hit the road Jack, and don't ya come back
No more, no more, no more, no more
Hit the road Jack, and don't ya come back no more
What'd you say?
Hit the road Jack, and don't ya come back
No more, no more, no more, no more
Hit the road Jack, and don't ya come back no more
