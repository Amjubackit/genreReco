[Black Pistol FIRE - Hipster Shakes]
[G minor pentatonic]
[VERSE-Black Pistol Fire]
My baby talks so much she lose her mind
Her violent hips and she know how to treat me right
I don't worry and I pay no mind
Chugging gasoline and she know how to start a fire
Knee high, just a baby child
Little heart breaker, old enough to tow the line
A cheeky smile and her daddy's good looks
She grew up hard, stealin' hearts just like a crook
[PRE-Chorus-Black Pistol Fire]
Roll me over time again, papa don't approve
I said roll me over, time again, papa don't approve about the way she walks
[Chorus-Black Pistol Fire]
You better watch your man, before she steals him too
You better watch your man, I won't be made a...
[VERSE-Black Pistol Fire]
I've got mind to give ya a talking to
Turn the other cheek, darlin' I ain't done with you
C'mon sugar, won't you take my shot
Arms folded across, show me what you really got
Knee high, just a baby child
Little heart breaker, old enough to tow the line
A cheeky smile and her daddy's good looks
She grew up hard, stealin' hearts just like a crook[PRE-Chorus-Black Pistol Fire]
[Chorus-Black Pistol Fire]
[BREAKDOWN-Black Pistol Fire]
Hey mama the way you roll that cone, oh see you cuppin' and a rattlin' those bones
C'mon down and do the hipster shake, someone let me out my cage
[Chorus ALT-Black Pistol Fire]
You better watch your man, before she steals yours too
You better watch your man, I won't be made a fool
