[Verse 1: Dia Frampton]
Where we are, we stay this way
Wrapped up in a summer daze
Try to find that piece of time
That lets me freeze you in my mind
[Pre-Chorus: Dia Frampton]
I don't want us to change, don't want us to chip away
Oh, I am trying to save our bodies against the waves
[Chorus: Dia Frampton]
Could we stay in bloo-ooo-oom?
Everything is new, ooh, ooh
I don't want to leave this room, just let me stay
Let me stay with you
Could we stay in bloo-ooo-oom?
[Drop: Dia Frampton]
Could we stay in?
Could we stay in?
Could we stay in?
Could we stay in?
[Verse 2: Dia Frampton]
Holding tight to what we had
If it's lost, will it come back?
Tell me if this windin' road
Is made of dirt or made of gold[Pre-Chorus: Dia Frampton]
I don't want us to change, don't want us to chip away
Oh, I am trying to save our bodies against the waves
[Chorus: Dia Frampton]
Could we stay in bloo-ooo-oom?
Everything was new, ooh, ooh
I don't want to leave this room, just let me stay
Let me stay with you
Could we stay in bloo-ooo-oom?
I don't want to leave this room, just let me stay
Let me stay with you
Could we stay in bloo-ooo-oom?
[Drop: Dia Frampton]
Could we stay in?
Could we stay in?
Could we stay in?
Could we stay in?
Could we stay in?
Could we stay in?
[Outro: Dia Frampton]
Could we stay in bloom?
Could we stay in bloom?
Could we stay in bloom?
Could we stay in bloom?
Could we stay in bloom?
Could we stay in bloom?
