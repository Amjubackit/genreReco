[Verse 1]
The city street is hot
The heat is escalating
Every corner in the town
There's a paycheck waiting
[Chorus]
Put a flower in your pocket
If you see them boy you drop it
And you run
You run
They may pretend they like you
But man's best friend will bite you
Just for fun
For fun
If they're gunning for you boy
You've already won
[Verse 2]
I had a dream today
About a hustler who lost
He paid his dues
Then he paid the cost
Wish I knew back then
All I know right now
Things would be much different
Than time has allowed
