[Verse 1: Luke Smallbone]
I am a little unstable
Loose wires always gettin' tangled now
I am a little bit difficult
I can be a little self-critical now
I am a little unable
To put all my cards on the table now
But somehow You're still with me
[Chorus: Joel Smallbone]
It's amazing that You can
Love me like I am
And even when I can't
You still love me as I am
Oh, I don't know how You do it
And I know I put You through it
It's amazing that You can
Love me like I, love me like I
[Post-Chorus: Joel & Luke Smallbone, 
Joel Smallbone
]
Am, 
ooh-ooh-ooh
You love me like I
Am, 
oh-oh-oh
You love me like I
Am[Verse 2: Luke & Joel Smallbone, 
Luke Smallbone
]
I am a little uneven
In need of a little more healing now
Yes, I am
 (
Yes, I am
)
And I feel a little unfixable
You're nothing short of a miracle now
'Cause somehow You're still with me
[Chorus: Joel Smallbone]
It's amazing that You can
Love me like I am
And even when I can't
You still love me as I am
Oh, I don't know how You do it
And I know I put You through it
It's amazing that You can
Love me like I, love me like I
[Post-Chorus: Joel & Luke Smallbone, 
Joel Smallbone
]
Am, 
ooh-ooh-ooh
You love me like I
Am, 
oh-oh-oh
You love me like I
Am
You love me like[Outro: Luke Smallbone]
It's amazing that You can
Love me like I am
And even when I can't
You still love me as I am
Yeah, I don't know how You do it
And I know I put You through it
It's amazing that You can
Love me like I, love me like I
Am
