I hurt so many nights
Cried so many hours
Trying to make it right
Just didn't have the power
You ignored all of my tears
In hopes they'd disappear
I tried to let it show
But I guess... you just don't wanna know
I came to you in love
I came to you in earnest
Could you possibly explain?
Why the flames, why the furnace?
Just needing to get it clear
I was hoping you would hear
I tried to let it go
But I guess... you just don't wanna know
Now it's true that God is always there
He said He'd never leave
But at times the human touch is what I need
And if I had a dime for every time
I tried to call your name
Some tell me, I'd be wealthy
But I learned that I could cope
I discovered I could make it
In nights so long and cold
So cold, you don't know how cold
I learned that I could take it
Now I wouldn't change a thing
Not for the knowledge
Not for the knowledge that I've gained
I learned that I could grow
I really did
I tried to let it show
I did. I tried to let it go
But I guess... you just don't wanna know
