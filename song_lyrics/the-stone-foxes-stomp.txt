Smoke keeps rising from the coal
Feed the fire and burn it slow
I don't need my eyes to see it's wrong
Everything I know will soon be gone
Whoa oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh-oh whoa oh-oh
Kill the crops and steal the stones
To make the streets and build the homes
Let it down and keep moving on
Everything I know will soon be gone
Whoa oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh-oh whoa oh-oh
There's no more water down in the well
The dirt is dry and it's hot as hell
The sun keeps beating and the days are long
Everything I know will soon be gone
Whoa oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh-oh whoa oh-oh
Oh keep the skins and leave the bones
For warm fur coats and leather thrones
I don't need my eyes to see it's wrong
Everything I know will soon be gone
Whoa oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh-oh whoa oh-oh
Whoa oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh-oh whoa oh-oh
