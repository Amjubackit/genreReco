[Verse 1]
How can I decide what's right
When you're clouding up my mind?
I can't win your losing fight
All the time
Nor can I ever own what's mine
When you're always taking sides
But you won't take away my pride
[Pre-Chorus]
No, not this time
Not this time
[Chorus]
How did we get here
When I used to know you so well?
But how did we get here?
Well, I think I know
[Verse 2]
The truth is hiding in your eyes
And it's hanging on your tongue
Just boiling in my blood
But you think that I can't see
What kind of man that you are
If you're a man at all
Well, I will figure this one out
