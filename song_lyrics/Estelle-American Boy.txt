[Intro: Kanye West & 
Estelle
]
This a number one champion sound (
Yeah
)
Yeah, Estelle, we 'bout to get down (
Get down
)
Who the hottest in the world right now? (
Uh
)
Just touched down in London town (
Uh
)
Bet they give me a pound (
Uh
)
Tell 'em put the money in my hand right now (
Yes
)
Tell the promoter we need more seats
We just sold out all the floor seats
[Chorus 1: Estelle]
Take me on a trip, I'd like to go some day
Take me to New York, I'd love to see LA
I really want to come kick it with you
You'll be my American boy
[Verse 1: Estelle]
He said, "Hey, sister, it's really, really nice to meet ya"
I just met this 5-foot-7 guy who's just my type
Like the way he's speakin', his confidence is peakin'
Don't like his baggy jeans but I might like what's underneath them
And, no, I ain't been to MIA
I heard that Cali never rains
 
and New York's wide awake
First let's see the West End, I'll show you to my bredrin
I'm likin' this American boy, American boy
