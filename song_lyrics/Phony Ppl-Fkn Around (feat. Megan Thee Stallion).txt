[Chorus: Elbee Thrie]
You got a man, but you're fuckin' around
Risking it all, baby, just to get down
You got a man, but you're fuckin' around
Risking it all, baby, just to get down
[Verse 1: Elbee Thrie]
Don't know if you know just what you're starting
But I can see you like to play with fire, darling
Your man just hit the bar to grab a chalice for you two
He turned his back just for a second, look at what you do
Sending me the supersonic signal
You ain't lay a finger, but I feel you
Independent woman, I won't tell you how to act
But you and I both know we could be gone 'fore he gets back
[Chorus: Elbee Thrie & 
Megan Thee Stallion
]
You got a man, but you're fuckin' around
Risking it all, baby, just to get down (
Ayy, ah, ayy, ayy
)
[Verse 2: Megan Thee Stallion]
Don't ask questions if we just sexing (Hey)
I got situations, no conformations (Mwah)
Everybody wanna know who Megan dating (Huh?)
Well that depends on whatever the day is (Hey, hey, woah)
I got me a European papi out in Italy
 (Okay)
And he like to model, but he always love to picture me
Flying overseas in these Giuseppes (Hey)
Send a pic from the back just to give him a tease (Hey, hey)
I keep a man in Texas, that's where the best is (Best is)
Down south daddy and he cool, never stress me (Yeah)
West coast thang, I'm in love with his slang (Ooh)
Ooh, I love a thug, keep it hood when we bang
