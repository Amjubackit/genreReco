[Verse 1]
You said that I've been actin’ different, yeah
Funny how I finally flipped the script on you
When you the one who's double-dippin', yeah
You so sloppy, how I caught you slippin’ up
You're off the lease
Run me my keys
No more poppin' up to hit it, yeah
I ain't even got the miles to trip on you
[Pre-Chorus]
New phone (Who is this?)
Brand new like the whip
Rack it up, no assist
Main bitch, I ain't average
Wake up, need a zip
Hennessy, take a sip
Look at my jeans, I'm too thick
I ain't got the room for extra baggage
[Chorus]
Don't forget to come and pick up your, ooh, feelings
Don’t leave no piеces (Oh, oh)
You need to hurry and pick up your, ooh-ooh, feelings
While I’m up cleaning
