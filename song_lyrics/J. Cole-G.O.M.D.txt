[Verse 1]
You wanna know just where I'm at?
Well, let me tell you 'bout it

But let me tell you 'bout it
They tryna say I can't come back
Ayy, let me tell you 'bout it
Man, fuck them niggas, I come back
Ayy, let me tell you 'bout it
I wanna tell you 'bout it:
Heads up, e'rybody run
Cole outside and he say he got a gun
Niggas like, "Man, that's what e'rybody said" (Uh-huh)
Go and pop the trunk and now e'rybody dead
E'rybody scared of the nigga, aware that the nigga is better (Better)
All my bitches the pick of the litter (Yeah,) never bitter
Niggas is fake, they anime
Me, I never hate, get cake like Anna Mae, woah
Eat the cake bitch, eat the damn cake (Cake), uh
Fuck good, nigga, we demand great (Great)
Order Domino then she take off all her cloth'
Nigga you know how it go, make the pizza man wait (Hol' up! Hol' up! Hol' up!)
The best-kept secret

Rest in peace any nigga want beef
Secret service couldn't keep the man safe
