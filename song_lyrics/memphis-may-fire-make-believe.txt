[Verse 1]
It's not the same as it used to be
And I'm afraid it's pointin' back at me
I have to question what I still believe
I just hope I find the missin' piece
[Pre-Chorus]
Feels like every day's the same
Chemicals inside my brain
Make me think I'm in a simulation
Nothing ever seems to change
And it's written on my face
Am I livin' in my own creation?
[Chorus]
Am I alive or am I just breathin'?
I'm so numb that sometimes I fear
It's all make-believe
Is it make-believe?
I'vе been lost, lookin' for a reason
To carry on, but I'm losin' hope
Is this all a dream?
Tеll me, is it make-believe?
[Verse 2]
I'm not the same as I used to be
I think I'm haunted by the things I've seen
Is anybody else the same as me?
(Is anybody else the same as me?)[Pre-Chorus]
It feels like every day's the same
Chemicals inside my brain
Make me think I'm in a simulation
Nothin' ever seems to change
And it's written on my face
Am I headed for my own damnation?
[Chorus]
Am I alive or am I just breathin'?
I'm so numb that sometimes I fear
It's all make-believe
Is it make-believe?
I've been lost, lookin' for a reason
To carry on, but I'm losin' hope
Is this all a dream?
Tell me, is it make-believe?
[Bridge]
Am I glitchin' in and out again?
When the game is over, will I see the end?
Maybe they just forgot to plug me in
The screen is black and now I'm seein' red
Now I'm seein' red
When the game is over, will I see the end?[Chorus]
Am I alive or am I just breathin'?
I'm so numb that sometimes I fear
It's all make-believe
Is it make-believe?
I've been lost, lookin' for a reason
To carry on, but I'm losin' hope
Is this all a dream?
Tell me, is it make-believe?
