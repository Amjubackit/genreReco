[Verse 1]
Darling, speak to me but don't you say a word
Light a cigarette, I'll watch it as it burns
Remember telling me that you thought you were cursed?
I'm in love with every song you've ever heard
[Verse 2]
If I could lose you, I would
We buried your bones in plywood
If I could lose you, I would
We buried your bones in plywood
[Pre-Chorus]
I said love is fast asleep
On a dirt road with your head on my shoulder
[Chorus]
Strawberry wine
, and all the time we used to have
Those things I miss but know are never coming back
For you, darling, for you
No thing definеs a man like love that makes him soft
And sеntimental like a stranger in the park
For a few moments, I see you
[Bridge]
If I was empty space and you were a formless shape, we'd fit
But love leaves little runway and every time we run straight over it
If I was empty space and you were a formless shape, we'd fit
But love leaves little runway and every time I run straight over it[Outro]
