[Verse 1]
No matter what they tell you
The future's up for grabs and no
No matter what they sell you
Is there a word for bad miracle?
Nobody said the road was endless
Nobody said the climb was friendless
But could we please pretend this won't end?
[Pre-Chorus]
It was an uphill battle
But they didn't know, but they didn't know
We were gonna use the roads as a ramp to take off
[Chorus]
We could cry a little, cry a lot
Don't stop dancing, don't dare stop
We'll cry later or cry now
You know it's heartbreak
We could dance our tears away, emancipate ourselves
We'll cry later or cry now, but baby
Heartbreak feels so good (No, oh, no)
Heartbreak feels so good (No, oh, no, oh)
[Verse 2]
We said we'd never grow up
It's open season on blue moods
Light from a screen of messages unsent
[Pre-Chorus]
It was an uphill battle
But they didn't know, but they didn't know
We were gonna use the roads as a ramp to take off
[Chorus]
We could cry a little, cry a lot
Don't stop dancing, don't dare stop
We'll cry later or cry now
You know it's heartbreak
We could dance our tears away, emancipate ourselves
We'll cry later or cry now, but baby
Heartbreak feels so good (No, oh, no)
Heartbreak feels so good (No, oh, no)
Heartbreak feels good (No, oh, no)
(Heartbreak feels good)
[Bridge]
It was an uphill battle (No)
But they didn't know, but they didn't know (Oh, no)
We were gonna use the roads as a ramp to take off
[Chorus]
And we could cry a little, cry a lot
Don't stop dancing, don't dare stop
We'll cry later or cry now
You know it's heartbreak
We could dance our tears away, emancipate ourselves
We'll cry later or cry now, but baby
Heartbreak feels good (No, oh, no)
Heartbreak feels good (No, oh, no, oh)
