[Verse 1]
You steady me
Slow and sweet, we sway
Take the lead and I will follow
[Verse 2]
Finally ready now
To close my eyes and just believe
That You won't lead me
Where You don't go
[Chorus]
When my faith gets tired
And my hope seems lost
You spin me round and round
And remind me of that song
The one You wrote for me
And we dance
And we dance
[Verse 3]
And I've been told
To pick up my sword
And fight for love
Little did I know
That Love had won for me
[Verse 4]
Here in Your arms
You still my heart again
And I breathe You in
Like I've never breathed 'till now
[Chorus]
When my faith gets tired
And my hope seems lost
You spin me round and round
And remind me of that song
The one You wrote for me
And we dance
Oh, we dance
Oh, we dance, we dance
Oh, a dance just You and me
[Bridge]
And I will lock eyes with the One who's ransomed me
The One who gave me joy for mourning
And I will lock eyes with the One who's chosen me
The One who set my feet to dancing
Oh, I will lock eyes with the One who's ransomed me
The One who gave me joy for mourning
Oh, I will lock eyes with the One who's chosen me
The One who set my feet to dancing
[Chorus]
Oh, we dance
Oh, we dance
Oh, we dance, we dance
Oh, we dance
Just You and me
[Outro]
It's nice to know I'm not alone
I found my home here in Your arms
It's nice to know I'm not alone
I found my home here in Your arms
It's nice to know I'm not alone
I found my home here in Your arms
It's nice to know I'm not alone
I found my home here in Your arms
