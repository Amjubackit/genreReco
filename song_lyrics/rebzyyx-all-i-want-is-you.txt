[Intro: Rebzyyx]
I know what you want, girl
Let me be the one to
Hold your— Hold your e—ver
We-We could toge—
[Verse 1: Rebzyyx]
I know what you want, girl
Let me be the one to
Hold your hand forever
We'd be good together
I’ll make you feel special
Help you feel less stressful
Fix the holes in your heart
It's what I wanted from the start
I got mental issues
Always fuckin' miss you
Tons of bloody tissues
All over my room
I need to clean them up
Baby, I’m fucked up
Baby, will you help me?
Because I'm gonna help you
[Chorus: Rebzyyx]
All I want is you now
All I wanna do now
Is wait for you to call me
Baby, I'm so sorry
Do you wanna hurt me?
Are you gonna hurt me?
Please don't desert me
Please don't desert me
All I want is you now
All I wanna do now
Is wait for you to call me
Baby, I'm so sorry
Do you wanna hurt me?
Are you gonna hurt me?
Please don't deserve me
Please don't deserve me[Verse 2: hoshie star]
Please don’t deserve me
I was up early
Up all night
I was scratchin’ off the 30s
You make me feel dirty
Tell me I'm disgustin’
Tell me that you love me
But really you mean nothin'
I don't wanna talk
No, it's not up for discussion
You control my life
I feel like a fuckin’ puppet
Keep tellin' me to shut it
Okay baby, alright
I remember nights
We were dancin' in the moonlight
I remember hidin'
I was shy and I had stage fright
I remember cryin'
I just want you to be alright
Want you to be okay
Okay baby, alright
Want you to be okay
Okay baby, alright[Chorus: Rebzyyx]
All I want is you now
All I wanna do now
Is wait for you to call me
Baby, I'm so sorry
Do you wanna hurt me?
Are you gonna hurt me?
Please don't deserve me
Please don't deserve me
All I want is you now
All I wanna do now
Is wait for you to call me
Baby, I'm so sorry
Do you wanna hurt me?
Are you gonna hurt me?
Please don't deserve me
Please don't deserve me
