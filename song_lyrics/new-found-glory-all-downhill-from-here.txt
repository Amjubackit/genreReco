[Verse 1]
You're hidin' something, 'cause it's burning through your eyes
I try to get it out, but all I hear from you are lies
[Pre-Chorus]
And I can tell you're going through the motions
Figured you were actin' out your part
Once again, we're playing off emotion
Which one of us will burn until the end?
[Chorus]
Catalyst, you insist to pull me down
You contradict the fact that you still want me around
And it's all downhill from here
And it's all downhill from here
[Verse 2]
Your good intentions slowly turn to bitterness
(Turn to bitterness)
Recurring episodes with each and every kiss
(Let's go!)
[Pre-Chorus]
And I can tell you're going through the motions
Figured you were actin' out your part
Once again, we're playing off emotion
Which one of us will burn until the end?[Chorus]
Catalyst, you insist to pull me down
You contradict the fact that you still want me around
And it's all downhill from here
And it's all downhill from here
[Bridge]
And I can't believe you pulled it off again
Or notice 'til it all sets in
You'll deny it 'til you're at your bitter end
[Pre-Chorus]
And I can tell you're going through the motions
Figured you were actin' out your part
Once again, we're playing off emotion
Which one of us will burn until the end?
[Chorus]
Catalyst, you insist to pull me down
You contradict the fact that you still want me around
And it's all downhill from here
And it's all downhill from here
[Outro]
And you keep pulling me down!
Pulling me down
Pulling me down
You contradict the fact that you still want me around
And it's all downhill from here
And it's all downhill from here
