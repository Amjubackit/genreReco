[Chorus]
Lovin' you
Has made my life much sweeter, baby
Baby, since I've got you
Everything is alright
[Verse 1]
When I'm lovin' you
I feel so good inside, ooh baby
When I make love to you
I'm in paradise, I'm in paradise, oh
[Pre-Chorus]
You know you make me feel
You make me feel so good
From my head down to my toes
And sometimes I wanna shout, I wanna scream
Tell the world about it
There's a girl in my mind
Your love is so good, so good, so good, so good to me
[Chorus]
Needing you
I need you in everything I do
Baby, since I've got you
My life is complete
[Pre-Chorus]
(I'm in paradise, I'm in paradise)
You know you make me feel
You make me feel so good
From my head down to my toes
And sometimes I wanna shout, I wanna scream
Oh and tell the world about it
There's a girl in my mind
Your love is so good, so good, so good to me, oh
[Chorus]
Lovin' you
Has made my life much sweeter, baby
Baby, since I've got you
Everything is alright
Everything is alright
[Outro]
The way you love me
Feels so right
The way you hold me
Feels alright
Everything is alright
When you kiss me, baby
Everything, everything is just, just
Feels so good it's not true
Everything is alright
As long as I keep food on the table
Long as I keep the bills paid, baby
Long as I'm lovin' you
Long as you're lovin' me
Everything is alright
As long as I'm taking care of you, baby
And every little thing is alright
The way you love me
(Everything, everything's alright)
The way you hold me
(Everything, everything's alright)
The way you wrap your arms
(Everything, everything's alright)
Wrap your arms around me
(Everything, everything's alright)
