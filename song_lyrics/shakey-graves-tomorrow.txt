I'm tired of losing
I used to win every night of the week
Yeah, back when sex and amphetamines
Were the staples of our childhood physique
You used to tell me we'd turn into something
Oh, you said life was much better than this
Yeah, but the closest I've come to perfection
Is when you turned around to steal a kiss
But you never trusted tomorrow
Yeah, baby is that anyway to live your life?
Well, you love this heart and this six string, girl
But they've been outta tune (yeah) for some time
Well, you said, "Oh, I love so many women
There's so many women, love, driving me wild"
Yeah, they say you get lost in complexion
And the structure of a well-placed smile
But luckily you, oh, you never smile
Yeah, you, oh you, you never smile
And it looks better that way to me
Sometimes it does
But, you know, you never trusted tomorrow
Oh, baby, that's just a problem of mine
Yeah, I've been thrown around by some bad ones, girl
Oh, and a good one was a new thing this time
