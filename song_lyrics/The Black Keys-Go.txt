[Verse 1]
In the summer time, when it's hot outside
The streets are bare, there's no one there, and the valley is wide
There comes a time, two hearts of gold
Leave together, run forever on the open road
[Chorus]
They gotta go oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
They gotta go oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
[Verse 2]
In the winter time, when the day is long
You're halfway there, the field is bare, and the fire is gone
Are you all alone? Are you feeling cold?
Find your flame, call her name, and hit the road
[Chorus]
You gotta go oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
You gotta go oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
[Outro]
You gotta go oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
You gotta go oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
You gotta go oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
You gotta go oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
