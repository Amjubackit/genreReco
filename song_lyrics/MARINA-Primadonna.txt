[Chorus]
Primadonna girl, yeah
All I ever wanted was the world
I can't help that I need it all
The primadonna life, the rise and fall
You say that I'm kinda difficult
But it's always someone else's fault
Got you wrapped around my finger, babe
You can count on me to misbehave
Primadonna girl
[Verse 1]
Would you do anything for me?
Buy a big diamond ring for me?
Would you get down on your knees for me?
Pop that pretty question right now, baby
Beauty queen on a silver screen
Living life like I'm in a dream
I know I've got a big ego
I really don't know why it's such a big deal though
[Refrain 1]
(Ooh)
 
And I'm sad to the core, core, core
(Yeah)
 
Every day is a chore, chore, chore
(Wow)
 
When you give, I want more, more, more
I wanna be adored
