[Interlude]
It's all we really want
Is to be in Your presence, presence
Long for Your presence
Nobody else will do
God, we're crying out for You
Send us Your presence
Hope you have your prayer languages
Begin to, pray in the spirit
Hallelujah, Holy Spirit
Thank You, Jesus
Fill this room with Your presence
Fill every heart with Your presence
Fill everyone who is watching with Your presence
It's Your presence that make all the difference
Yes, it's Your presence, God
We can speak to the mountain and command them to move
There's fullness of joy in Your presence
Depression has to go in Your presence
Ah, yes, Lord
Life is in Your presence
Abundant life is in Your presence
Hope is in Your presence
Lord, our world needs hope
Send down Your presence
Send down Your presence
Nobody else will do
Nobody but You

In Revelation 4:9-11, it reads
9
 
And when those beasts give glory and honor and thanks to him that sat on the throne who liveth for ever and ever,
 
10
 
The four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne and worship him that liveth for ever and ever and cast their crowns before the throne saying,
 
11
 
Thou art worthy O Lord to receive glory and honor and power for thou hast created all things and for thy pleasure they are and were created
.
So God, we're here for You
We were created for Your pleasure
