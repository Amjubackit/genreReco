[Chorus]
Girl, you think you got it bad
(Da-da-da, da, da-da-da)
Girl, you think you got it bad
(Da-da-da, da, da-da-da)
Girl, you think you got it bad
(Da-da-da, da, da-da-da)
[Verse 1]
Got our different ways with the same old payout
Had our own dreams with the same old outcome
Had it to extreme and the same old break down
Work it to the bone and the same won't happen
[Chorus]
Girl, you think you got it bad
(Da-da-da, da, da-da-da)
Girl, you think you got it bad
(Da-da-da, da, da-da-da)
Girl, you think you got it bad
(Da-da-da, da, da-da-da)
[Verse 2]
Got our different ways with the same old payout
Had our own dreams with the same old outcome
Had it to extreme and the same old break down
Work it to the bone and the same won't happen
[Bridge]
You like it, like it so bad
And now you turn away
You like it, like it so bad
And now you turn away
[Chorus]
Girl, you think you got it bad
(Da-da-da, da, da-da-da)
Girl, you think you got it bad
(Da-da-da, da, da-da-da)
Girl, you think you got it bad
(Da-da-da, da, da-da-da)
