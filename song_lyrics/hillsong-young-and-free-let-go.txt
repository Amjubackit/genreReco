[Verse 1: Aodhan King]
I close my eyes and colours fly
There's no hiding from Your grace
I can't deny Your heart for mine
And its unrelenting chase
[Pre-Chorus: Aodhan King]
I was on the edge of deception
Caught up in my own hesitation
Until Your love took over me
[Chorus: Aodhan King]
So I let go and I let love
Show me life like it's supposed to be
An oasis here awaits us
All the freedom I'll ever need
Now I'm alive
Oh-la-la, oh-la-la
When I let go then I find life
Oh-la-la, oh-la-la
When I let go then I find life
[Breakdown]
La-la-la-la-la
When I let go then I find life
[Verse 2: Karina Wykes]
The higher way is calling me
To a life unlike before
The Father's heart is beckoning
And I can't resist no more
[Pre-Chorus 2: Karina Wykes w/ Aodhan King]
Lead me in the ways of devotion
I don't want to get caught in the motions
My heart is only for You, Lord
[Chorus: Aodhan King]
So I let go and I let love
Show me life like it's supposed to be
An oasis here awaits us
All the freedom I'll ever need
Now I'm alive
Oh-la-la, oh-la-la
When I let go then I find life
Oh-la-la, oh-la-la
When I let go then I find life
[Breakdown]
La-la-la-la-la
When I let go then I find life
[Chorus: Aodhan King]
So I let go and I let love
Show me life like it's supposed to be
An oasis here awaits us
All the freedom I'll ever need
Now I'm alive
When I let go then I find life
When I let go... then I find life
[Breakdown]
La-la-la-la-la
When I let go then I find life
[Outro]
Oh-la-la, oh-la-la
When I let go then I find life
Oh-la-la, oh-la-la
When I let go then I find life
