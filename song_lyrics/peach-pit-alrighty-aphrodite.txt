[Verse 1]
Take a seat back in your clamshell
If the ocean's not enough, nor am I
Rollin' in, I feel a dark swell
Crawlin' up the skin of my spine
[Chorus]
If I'd known you sold on maybe
I'd a let you waste another guy
Well alrighty Aphrodite
Go whip that red for other eyes
[Verse 2]
Run your mornin' bath in sea foam
Soak your milky skin in the tide
Little pearl you think you're in gold
But I can see the dirt in your lines
[Chorus]
If I'd known you sold on maybe
I'd a let you waste another guy
Well alrighty Aphrodite
Go whip that red
 for other eyes
If I'd known you sold on maybe
I'd a let you waste another guy
Well alrighty Aphrodite
Go whip that red for other eyes
