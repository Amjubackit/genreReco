[Verse 1]
You opened my eyes
To the unseen
Once I was blind
But now I believe
You tore down the walls
That kept us apart
What seemed like the end
Was only the start
[Chorus]
Heaven's all around
Heaven's all around
Jesus is near
I can see it now
I can see it now
Your Kingdom is here
Heaven's all around
Heaven's all around
Jesus is near
I can see it now
I can see it now
Your Kingdom is here
[Verse 2]
For all that we've seen
There's still more to come
We know You'll finish
What You've begun
Battles may rage
But we will not fear
'Cause we know our victory
Is standing right here[Chorus]
Heaven's all around
Heaven's all around
Jesus is near
I can see it now
I can see it now
Your Kingdom is here
Heaven's all around
Heaven's all around
Jesus is near
And I can see it now
I can see it now
Your Kingdom is here
[Bridge]
