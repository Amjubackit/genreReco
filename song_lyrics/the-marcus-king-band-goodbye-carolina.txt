[Verse 1]
I dreamed of the day
That I'd hold you in my arms again
Read you all the letters I wrote, never sent
Give you all the pieces of me
Put 'em back together
Put 'em back together again
Life has a way of writing your story for you
And the hero doesn't always get his girl
What if you could change the ending
To the novel they've been writing
Leave no resolution
[Chorus]
So goodbye Carolina
Searched my whole life to find you
I hate to leave you
But I hope you'll know
Where I'm going I'll be seeing you
So hold my hand as I'm leaving
Hoped my pain would be enough reason
I'll see you on the other side of the Blue Ridge sky
Now I'm going
Hate to tell you goodbye
[Verse 2]
Say it takes a selfish man
To leave on out from his old hometown
Without saying why he's going
But you can come take the rest of me
Early in the morning
Tell me your goodbyes
Where I'm going I won't have these reminders
Of what I lost and what was taken away from me
And I hope you'll understand
I was a broken man in my own hometown
Need to find my own peace
