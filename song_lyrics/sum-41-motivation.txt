[Verse 1]
What's the difference of never knowing at all
When every step I take is always too small?
Maybe it's just something I can't admit
But lately, I feel like I don't give a shit
[Chorus]
Motivation's such an aggravation
Accusations, don't know how to take them
Inspiration's getting hard to fake it
Concentration, never hard to break it
Situation never what you want it to be
[Verse 2]
What's the point of never making mistakes?
Self-indulgence, such a hard habit to break
It's all just a waste of time in the end
Don't care, so why should I even pretend?
[Chorus]
Motivation's such an aggravation
Accusations, don't know how to take them
Inspiration's getting hard to fake it
Concentration, never hard to break it
Situation never what you wanted[Bridge]
Nothing's new (Everything's the same)
Keeps on draggin' me down (It's getting kind of lame)
Falling further behind (There's nothing to explain)
No matter what you say, nothing's gonna change my mind
[Bridge]
Can't depend on doubt until the end
It seems like leaving friends has become this year's trend
And though I can't pretend, afraid to be this way
It's not the same, but who's to blame for all those stupid things I never said?
[Chorus]
Motivation's such an aggravation
Accusations, don't know how to take them
Inspiration's getting hard to fake it
Concentration, never hard to break it
Motivation's such an aggravation
Accusations, don't know how to take them
Inspiration's getting hard to fake it
Concentration, situation never what you want it to be
[Outro]
Never what you want it to be
Never what you want it to be
