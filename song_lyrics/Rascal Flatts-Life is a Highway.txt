[Intro]
Woo
Hmm, yeah
[Verse 1]
Life's like a road that you travel on
When there's one day here and the next day gone
Sometimes you bend, sometimes you stand
Sometimes you turn your back to the wind
There's a world outside every darkened door
Where blues won't haunt you anymore
Where the brave are free and lovers soar
Come ride with me to the distant shore
[Pre-Chorus 1]
We won't hesitate
To break down the garden gate
There's not much time left today, yeah
[Chorus]
Life is a highway
I wanna ride it all night long
If you're goin' my way
I wanna drive it all night long
[Verse 2]
Through all these cities and all these towns
It's in my blood and it's all around
I love you now like I loved you then
This is the road and these are the hands
From Mozambique to those Memphis nights
The Khyber Pass to Vancouver's lights
Knock me down, I'm back up again
You're in my blood, I'm not a lonely man
