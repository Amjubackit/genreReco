[Verse 1]
Nobody on the road
Nobody on the beach
I feel it in the air
The summer's out of reach
Empty lake, empty streets
The sun goes down alone
I'm drivin' by your house
Though I know you're not home
[Chorus]
I can see you
Your brown skin shinin' in the sun
You got your hair combed back and your
Sunglasses on, baby
And I can tell you, my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone
[Verse 2]
I never will forget those nights
I wonder if it was a dream
Remember how you made me crazy? (Crazy)
Remember how I made you scream?
But I don't understand what happened to our love
But baby, when I get you back
I'm gonna show you what I'm made of
