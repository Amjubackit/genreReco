[Instrumental]
[Verse]
And I've got a river of living water
A fountain that never will run dry
It's an open heaven You're releasing
And we will never be denied
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause we're stirring up deep, deep wells
We're stirring up deep, deep waters
We're gonna dance in the river, dance in the river
'Cause we're stirring up deep, deep wells
We're stirring up deep, deep waters
We're gonna jump in the river, jump in the river
[Chorus]
The deep cries out, the deep cries out to You
The deep cries out, the deep cries out to You
We cry out, and we cry out to You, You, Jesus
[Verse]
And I've got a river of living water
A fountain that never will run dry
It's an open heaven You're releasing
And we will never be denied[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause we're stirring up deep, deep wells
We're stirring up deep, deep waters
We're gonna dance in the river, dance in the river
'Cause we're stirring up deep, deep wells
We're stirring up deep, deep waters
We're gonna jump in the river, jump in the river
[Chorus]
The deep cries out, the deep cries out to You
The deep cries out, the deep cries out to You
We cry out, and we cry out to You, You, Jesus
The deep cries out, the deep cries out to You
The deep cries out, the deep cries out to You
We cry out, and we cry out to You, You, Jesus
[Bridge]
We're falling into deeper waters, calling out to You
We're walking into deeper waters, going after You
[Post-Bridge]
And if He goes to the left then we'll go to the left
And if He goes to the right then we'll go to the right
We're gonna jump-jump, jump-jump, in the river
Jump-jump, jump-jump everybody
If He goes to the left then we'll go to the left
And if He goes to the right then we'll go to the right
We're gonna dance-dance, dance-dance, in the river
Dance-dance, dance-dance everybody
If He goes to the left then we'll go to the left
And if He goes to the right then we'll go to the right
We're gonna jump-jump, jump-jump, in the river
Jump-jump, jump-jump everybody
If He goes to the left then we'll go to the left
And if He goes to the right then we'll go to the right
We're gonna shout-shout, shout-shout, in the river
Shout-shout, shout-shout! Yeah![Interlude]
[Chorus]
The deep cries out, the deep cries out to You
The deep cries out, the deep cries out to You
We cry out, and we cry out to You, You, Jesus
The deep cries out, the deep cries out to You
The deep cries out, the deep cries out to You
We cry out, and we cry out to You, You, Jesus!
