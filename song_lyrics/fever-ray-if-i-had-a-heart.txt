[Verse 1]
This will never end 'cause I want more
More, give me more, give me more
This will never end 'cause I want more
More, give me more, give me more
[Verse 2]
If I had a heart, I could love you
If I had a voice, I would sing
After the night when I wake up
I'll see what tomorrow brings
[Chorus]
Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah
If I had a voice, I would sing
[Verse 3]
Dangling feet from window frame
Will they ever ever reach the floor?
(More, give me more, give me more)
Cushion filled with all I found
Underneath and inside, just to come around
(More, give me more, give me more)[Chorus]
Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah
If I had a voice, I would sing
