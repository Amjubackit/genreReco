[Verse 1]
Over the horizon
She's smooth sailin'
These concrete seas
Now she's headed
East down the boule-, the -vard
[Refrain]
Sugar
Said I like the way (Like the way)
Said I like the way (Like the way)
You sail your ship down
Let me be your cargo
I won't weigh you down
No, honey, I won't weigh you down
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 2]
I don't really know
Her destination
But I got a feeling I
Get to be your passenger
Sugar, let me be your passenger
[Refrain]
Sugar
Said I like the way (Like the way)
Said I like the way (Like the way)
You sail your ship down
Let me be your cargo
I won't weigh you down
No, honey, I won't weigh you down
[Chorus]
She's smooth
Smooth sailin' (Smooth sailin', yeah)
She's smooth
Smooth, darling
[Instrumental Break]
[Bridge]
Sweet pretty, baby
Won't you be my lady, oh?
Sweet honey, darling
You know I'm calling
I want you
[Refrain]
Sugar
Said I like the way (Like the way)
Said I like the way (Like the way)
You sail your ship down
Let me be your cargo
I won't weigh you down
No, honey, I won't weigh you down
[Chorus]
She's smooth
Smooth sailin' (Smooth sailin' yeah)
She's smooth
Smooth, ooh darling
[Bridge]
Sweet pretty baby
Won't you be my lady, oh?
Sweet honey, darling
You know I'm calling
I want you
[Outro]
Sugar
Said I like the way (Like the way)
Said I like the way (Like the way)
You sail your ship down
Let me be your cargo
I won't weigh you down
No, honey, I won't weigh you down
