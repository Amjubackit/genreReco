[Verse 1: Jamie Paige]
Boy, you're perfect, I see it in your eyes (Eyes)
You wanna have this, don't you realize ('Lize)
Infatuated, with a little taste (Taste, taste)
Boy, you're perfect
(Don't think you can escape)
I wanna see it, wanna feel your love (Love)
I wanna touch it, I'll never have enough
Boy, I love you, you're my little steal (Steal)
Boy, you're perfect
(And I'll kill those other girls you seem to love)
[Chorus: Jamie Paige]
I want your everything, every single part of you
(If you think you can fuck with me, you're going to lose)
I want to taste your love, anything you want to do
(And I'll kill you if you try to run, you're mine and mine alone)
[Verse 2: Shiki]
Girl, taste my love, every single last drop
Won't be satisfied, baby, 'til you beggin' me to stop
Oops, there he go, it's that boy again
I mean that cocky motherfucker, all he do is win
I mean that ecchi sister lover, 
kami sama
 under cover
Fuck around and break that rubber, don't speak of it like Another
Oh my God, that's too mean, these 
kouhais
 on that lean
They say when they hear my voice, it's like promethazine
They fiend when I make 'em moist, drippin' through they jeans
So I slurp 'em up and don't stop until they clean
Shawty gettin' rough, she cut me, don't give a fuck
Shades of 
Yuno Gasai
, 
she drug, then tie me up
Good thing I'm a savage, so senpai always manage
Flip up the script, leave her pinned down to the mattress
Ecchi 'til I die, these imoutos call me senpai
Girl, I'm yandere, suck your blood 'til it runs dry
Starin' at those legs, get entranced by those thigh highs
Been hypnotized, so enthralled by those moe eyes
Oh my, it's the king of ecchi
Fangirls worldwide 
sayin' my voice is sexy
I don't care what you say, I know one thing's true
They don't love you like I do
