[Verse 1]
What do you say we pack our things and get out of here
I’ve been saving all my life just to disappear
Can I hold you, can I hold you to that
You can’t go on living life hiding behind fear
All the thoughts in my fucked up head are finally coming clear
Can I hold you, can I hold you to that
[Chorus]
We could see the world
We could see the world
We could see the world
We could see the world
We could see the world
Whoa
[Verse 2]
What do you say we pack the car and get behind the wheel
All we have to do is drive and let the feeling steer
Can I hold you, can I hold you to that
[Chorus]
We could see the world
We could see the world
We could see the world
We could see the world
We could see the world
Whoa
[Bridge]
Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh
[Outro]
See the world, see the world
See the world, see the world
See the world, see the world
See the world, see the world
