[Verse 1]
I got to have a shot
For what you got is, oh, so sweet
You got to make it hot
Like a boomerang, I need a repeat
[Chorus]
Gimme all your lovin'
All your hugs and kisses too
Gimme all your lovin'
Don't let up until we're through
[Verse 2]
You got to whip it up
And hit me like a ton of lead
If I blow my top
Will you let it go to your head?
[Chorus]
Gimme all your lovin'
All your hugs and kisses too
Gimme all your lovin'
Don't let up until we're through
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Verse 3]
You got to move it up
And work it like a screwball would
Got to pack it up
Baby, work it like a new boy should
[Chorus]
Gimme all your lovin'
All your hugs and kisses too
Gimme all your lovin'
Don't let up until we're through
