[Chorus: Paul Russell]
Ms. Poli Sci, come on over tonight
You told me
"Don't know your feelings, can we focus on mine?"
I think I'm up
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-ooo
I hope that's enough
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-ooo
[Verse 1: Paul Russell]
She wanna talk late
She wonder if we went the wrong or the long way
I said I'll bring out the effort for desserts but
She out here asking all these questions about the entrées
Girl you not Beyoncé
Baby let that paycheck hit
'Cause I just wanna be the man that you play that with
I wanna know your home friends and then make that trip
And get a couch as big as the doorway and make that fit
You feel?
[Chorus: Paul Russell]
Ms. Poli Sci, come on over tonight
You told me
"Don't know your feelings, can we focus on mine?"
I think I'm up
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-ooo
I hope that's enough
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-ooo[Verse 2: Khary]
Sometimes I wonder where the pain goes
I was feeling shitty but you lift me up, angel
Livin' in the city where the pretty people change slow
Pot of gold find you by the rainbow
I don't have an angle I just wanna see you right
Here by my side, build a child that can read and write
Hold up, never mind, we got time, I don't need a wife
Or the number fives on the dice, it's the key to life
[Chorus: Paul Russell]
Ms. Poli Sci, come on over tonight
You told me
"Don't know your feelings, can we focus on mine?"
I think I'm up
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-ooo
I hope that's enough
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-ooo
