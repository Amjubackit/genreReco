[Verse 1]
We'll take the 
copper from the worksite
Meet me there at midnight, they ain't got a camera or a guard
Write my own prescription, if I can't get a fix, son
Shit's about to get real hard
[Verse 2]
Molly don't believe me, says she's gonna leave me
The kids won't even know my name
Put a gallon in the 
step side
With a little help, by morning I won't feel no pain
[Verse 3]
Never thought I'd wind up this far behind
Just a couple years back, we had it made
I was emptying my bladder on a twеnty foot ladder
Shoulda climbed down and found myself somе shade
[Verse 4]
Doctor took a quick look and I got out the checkbook
And left with a pocket full of pills
Now my back's still hurtin' and I'm too weak for workin'
And I can't keep up with all the bills
[Chorus 1]
She used to wake me up with coffee every morning
And I'd hear her homemade house shoes slide across the floor
She used to make me feel like the king of Oklahoma
But nothing makes me feel like much of nothing anymore[Verse 5]
I was all set up to do it but some bastard beat me to it
Ain't a copper pipe left on the lot
Got a loan out on the truck but I'm runnin' out of luck
And the title is the only thing I've got
[Verse 6]
Molly's gonna leave me, says she don't believe me
I got nothing left to lie about
She's going back to Bixby, tired of trying to fix me
Says I got some shit to figure out
[Chorus 1]
She used to wake me up with coffee every morning
And I'd hear her homemade house shoes slide across the floor
And she used to make me feel like the king of Oklahoma
But nothing makes me feel like much of nothing anymore
[Chorus 2]
She used to wake me up with coffee every morning
And I'd act like I was sleepin' til she'd walk back through the door
She used to make me feel like the king of Oklahoma
But nothing makes me feel like much of nothing anymore
