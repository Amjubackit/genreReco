[Verse 1]
Am I-
Am I still tough enough?
Feels like Iâ€™m wearing down, down, down, down, down
Is my viciousness
L-Losing ground, ground, ground, ground, ground?
Am I taking too much
Did I cross a line, line, line?
I need my role in this
Very clearly defined
[Chorus]
I need your discipline
I need your help
I need your discipline
You know once I start I cannot help myself
[Verse 2]
And now it's starting up
Feels like I'm losing touch
Nothing matters to me
Nothing matters as much
I see you left a mark
Up and down my skin, skin, skin
I don't know where I end
And where you begin[Chorus]
I need your discipline
I need your help
I need your discipline
You know once I start I cannot help myself
[Post-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
[Bridge]
(I cannot stop myself)
(Once I start I cannot stop myself)
And you
Once I start I cannot stop myself
And you know
Once I start I cannot stop myself
And you
Once I start I cannot stop myself
And you know
Once I start I cannot stop myself
[Outro]
I need your discipline
(And you)
I need your help
(Once I start I cannot stop myself)
I need your discipline
(And you know)
Because once I start I cannot stop myself
I need your discipline
(And you)
I need your help
(Once I start I cannot stop myself)
I need your discipline
(And you know)
Because once I start I cannot stop myself
(And you)
Once I start I cannot stop myself
(And you know)
Once I start I cannot stop myself
I need your discipline
(And you)
Once I start I cannot stop myself
I need your discipline
(And you know)
Cannot stop myself
