[Verse 1]
Cannot spend another night in this home
I close my eyes and take a breath real slow
The consequence is if I leave, I'm alone
But what's the difference when you beg for love?
'Cause I run through glass in the street
Kerosene hearts carry
 
the name that my father gave me
And take the face of the wolf
[Chorus]
'Cause this is a wasteland, my only retreat
With heaven above you, there's hell over me
[Verse 2]
I met a girl who never looked so alone
Like sugar water in your mouth lukewarm
She tied a cherry stem for me with her tongue
We fell in love and now we're both alone
'Cause I don't need any more friends
And another kiss like a fire on pavement
We'll burn it down to the end
Oh, oh
[Chorus]
This is a wasteland, my only retreat
With heaven above you, there's hell over me
The water is rusted, the air is unclean
And there for a second, I feel free
This is a wasteland, my only retreat
