[Verse 1]
I need you more than you want me
Hold a candle till it burns into nothing
'Cause I've been around the world and drowned in love a hundred times
And every time I start to fall you turn around and change your mind
[Verse 2]
I lost my fortune betting on people
Left my heart in the Bay of San Francisco
'Cause I've been around the world and drowned in love a hundred times
And every time I start to fall you turn around and change your mind
