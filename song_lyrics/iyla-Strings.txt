[Chorus]
Why do I feel like your puppet?
You pull my strings while you play me
Why do I move with your movement?
Up on your stage I'm performing
Left you but I'm back here on your sofa
Thought I needed space I want you closer
So why do I move with your movement
Under your strings like a puppet?
[Verse 1]
I'm too up front to turn my back on this
Swear you did a number on me like some raffle tickets
Lucky you, you stuck with me might as well tattoo this ****
Be like that sometimes, you show up I be acting different (Different)
[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe I'm crazy, but if I lose you
Oh, I don't know if I'll survive
You drive me crazy for your amusement
And I'm along-long for the ride
Got me talking to myself, saying to myself, "Oh no"
Sweet nightmare not a beautiful dream
Should move it to the left, move it to the left
Oh I, know I know better, know I know better
