[Verse 1]
Ayy
Homer hanging on my neck
The bracelet matches the set
My brother named his ting Nadal
Let's stop all that back and forth over the 'net
My mama wish I woulda went corporate
She wish I woulda went exec'
I still turn to a CEO so the lifestyle she respect
Ayy, two sprinters to Quebec
Chérie, où est mon bec?
They only givin' niggas plus ones, so I never pull up to the Met
You know I gotta bring the set
You know I gotta bring the G-Block
You know I gotta bring the D-Block
[Chorus]
'Causе you know how sticky it get (Ayy)
You know how sticky it get (Ayy)
You know how sticky it get (Ayy)
You know how sticky it gеt (Ayy)
She want me to play with that cat (Ayy)
She lovin' how I'm makin' her wet (Ayy)
You know how sticky it get (Ayy)
[Verse 2]
Ayo Eric, bring them girls to the stage
'Cause somebody's getting paid and
Free Big Slime out the cage and
Shawty try to play it cool but
Now she wish she woulda stayed 'cause
Every song that I made is
Ringin' like I got engaged (Yeah)
Love my guys, I wouldn't trade (Ayy)
From the cradle to the grave (Ayy)
Gordo got me on the wave (Ayy)
Ant got me on the wave (Ayy)
Couple hits, now you brave, boy
You niggas better behave (What)
All that pumpin' up your chest (What)
All that talk about the best (What)
You know how sticky it gets
