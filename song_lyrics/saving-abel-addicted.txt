[Chorus]
I'm so addicted to
All the things you do
When you're going down on me
In between the sheets
Oh, the sounds you make
With every breath you take
It's unlike anything
When you're loving me
[Verse 1]
Ooh, girl, let's take it slow
So as for you, well, you know where to go
I wanna take my love and hate you 'til the end
[Pre-Chorus]
It's not like you to turn away
From all the bullshit I can't take
It's not like me to walk away
[Chorus]
I'm so addicted to
All the things you do
When you're going down on me
In between the sheets
Oh, the sounds you make
With every breath you take
It's unlike anything
When you're loving me
Yeah
