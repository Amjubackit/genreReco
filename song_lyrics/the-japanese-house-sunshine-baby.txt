[Verse 1: Amber Bain]
I wanna be a part of it, I wanna sing along
The feeling when the windscreen wipers line up with the song
Perform my stupid rituals, everything is cyclical
[Pre-Chorus]
Hold on to this feeling 'cause you won't feel it for long
You won't feel it for long
[Chorus: Amber Bain]
I don't know what's right anymore
I don't wanna fight anymore
Sitting in the back seat, driving with my sunshine baby
Well, I've gone a little crazy
Surely someone's gonna save me now
[Verse 2: Amber Bain]
I miss my dog and I miss falling in love
I miss the feeling that you get when someone fits just like a glove
I can't help but question, maybe this isn't helping
[Pre-Chorus]
Putting off the end 'cause in the end, it always does
In the end it always does
[Chorus: Amber Bain]
I don't know what's right anymore
I don't wanna fight anymore
Sitting in the back seat, driving with my sunshine baby
Well, I've gone a little crazy
Surely someone's gonna save me now[Bridge: Amber Bain, 
Matty Healy
]
Now we're right where we are (
Sitting in the back seat, driving with my sunshine baby
)
I don't wanna fight with her (
Well, I've gone a little crazy, surely someone's gonna save me now
)
Sitting by the seafront, lying with my sunshine baby
Well, I've gone a little crazy
Surely someone's gonna save me now
[Outro: Matty Healy, 
Amber Bain

Back seat drivin' with my sunshine baby
Well, I've gone a little crazy
Surely someone's gonna save me
Sitting in the back seat
Driving with my sunshine baby
Well, I've
 gone a little 
crazy
Surely someone's gonna save me
I don't know what's right anymore
 (Sitting in the back seat, driving with my sunshine baby)
I don't wanna fight anymore
 (Well, I've gone a little crazy, surely someone's gonna save me now)
Sitting in the back seat, driving with my sunshine baby
Well, I've gone a little crazy
Surely someone's gonna save me now
