[Verse 1]
There's a lot of boys in California
They don't get along
Like you and I
(Ooh)
So pretty that you kill me softly (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
If you were to leave me
If I were to die
You know I really wanna risk it all (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Kiss my collarbone
Found my archetype
[Chorus]
If you need me, I'll be right there waiting
Hold me 'til I break thin, don't want this to end (Don't want this to end, woo)
Could you help me?
Help you think about me
I think of you daily
I could give you all (I can give you all)
[Post-Chorus]
You're the only one that holds me
You're the only one that holds me
[Verse 2]
Yeah, I know you're feelin' paranoia (Why?)
Are you in love?
'Cause I wanna try
I can tell just by the way that you talkin' to me
You don't have a clue (You don't have a clue)
Neither do I (Neither do I)
I didn't really think you cared at all (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
What you said on the phone (Said on the phone)
Left me 
petrified
(Bah)[Chorus]
If you need me, I'll be right there waiting
Hold me 'til I break thin, don't want this to end (Don't want this to end)
Could you help me?
Help you think about me
I think of you daily
I could give you all (I can give you all)
[Post-Chorus]
You're the only one that holds me
You're the only one that holds me
(Ah-ah-ah) You're the only (Ah-ah-ah) one that holds me (Ah-ah-ah)
You're the only (Ah-ah-ah) one that holds me (Woo)
[Outro]
There's a lot of boys in California
They don't get along
Like you and I
(Woo)
