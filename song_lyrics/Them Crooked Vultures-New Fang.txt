[Verse 1]
New fang, no thing, had it made
To parade, found a sucker, now I want another
Stand up, step aside, open wide
Hangin' out another 'til the feeling's gone
Want to? Yes, I do
Found a love, takin' turns gettin' carpet burns
Loose lips, lipstick spit
Come and go, I think it's both, I gotta know
[Chorus]
Sometimes you break a finger on the upper hand
Think you've got me confused for a better man
Sometimes you break the finger on the upper hand
Say you've got me confused, oh
I ain't a better man
[Verse 2]
No slack, Cadillac, couldn't quit
Gums flap, so here's your teeth back
Accept what I left
Far behind in a time when my mind was like a landmine
Tailgate by the lake
Too much, too young, every button gonna come undone
Tightrope, no joke
Nothing left so you go baroque
