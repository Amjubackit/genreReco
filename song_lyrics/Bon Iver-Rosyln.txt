[Verse 1]
Up with your turret
Aren't we just terrified?
Shale, screen your worry
From what you won't ever find
[Chorus]
Don't let it fool you
Don't let it fool you
Down
Dancing around
Folds in her gown
[Verse 2]
Sea and the rock below
Cocked to the undertow
Bones, blood, and teeth erode
With every crashing node
[Chorus]
Wings wouldn't help you
Wings wouldn't help you
Down
Down fills the ground
Gravity's proud
