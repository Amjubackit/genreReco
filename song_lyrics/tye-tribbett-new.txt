I'm ready to go
Ready for more
I'm ready for new, like it's straight out the the store
You alrеady know
I'm ready to flow
I'm ready to move thе old is through
I'm in pappa's new bag
And it still got the tag
So you know that it's new
[Verse 1]
New mind, new heart
I got that new start
New light, new day
It's my life His way
New praise, new look
New page, new book
New flame, burn up
New wine, turn up
Looked at my hands, they look brand new
Looked at my feet, they look new too
New joy, new strength
I'm loving this newness
Past is long gone
It's time to sing a new song[Chorus]
New, new, new
Everything new, new, new, new
New, new, everything new (Everything fresh)
New, new, new
Everything new, new, new, new
New, new, everything new

I'm in pappa's new bag
And it still got the tag
So you know that it's new
[Verse 2]
It's a new beginning
 (New beginning)
It's a realm of winnin'
 (Only winnin')
It's a time to shout, it's a time to dance, we not dead, we livin'
 (Livin', livin')
It's a time of peace
 (Woo, peace)
It's a time for joy
 (Woo, joy)
No time for no games, time serve the Lord
 (No, no, no, no)
Let Him bring you out
 (Bring you out)
Let Him bring you through
 (Bring you through)
Let Him take ya old ways throw 'em all away and make you new
 (Make you, make you new)
Tried Him and I know
He changed my flow
 (Changed my flow)
And He would do the same for you
I'm tellin' you what God will do He'll make you New[Chorus]
New, new, new
Everything new, new, new, new
New, new, everything new (He makes all things new)
New, new, new
Everything new, new, new, new
New, new, everything new (He'll make you new)
[Post-Chrous]
I'm ready to go (I'm ready to go)
Ready for more (Ready for more)
I'm ready for new (I'm ready for new)
Like it's straight out the the store (Straight out the the store)
You already know (You already know)

I'm ready to move the old is through
I'm in pappa's new bag
And it still got the tag
So you know that it's new
Still got the tag so you know that it's new
You know that it's new

Old is through, I'm in pappa's new bag
And it still got the tag
So you know that it's new[Outro]
New like a beautiful day
New like my love for Shante
New like the gifts I be givin' my kids
When they open them on Christmas day (Sheesh)
