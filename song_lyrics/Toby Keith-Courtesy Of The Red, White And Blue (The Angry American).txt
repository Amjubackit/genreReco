[Intro]
American girls and American guys
We’ll always stand up and salute, we’ll always recognize
When we see Old Glory flying
 there’s a lot of men dead
So we can sleep in peace at night when we lay down our head
[Verse 1]
My daddy served in the army where he lost his right eye
But he flew a flag out in our yard 'til the day that he died
He wanted my mother, my brother, my sister and me
To grow up and live happy in the land of the free
[Verse 2]
Now this nation that I love has fallen under attack
A mighty sucker punch came flying in from somewhere in the back
Soon as we could see it clearly through our big black eye
Man, we lit up your world like the Fourth of July
[Chorus]
Hey, Uncle Sam
 put your name at the top of his list
And the Statue of Liberty started shaking her fist
And the eagle will fly and it’s gonna be hell
When you hear Mother Freedom start ringing her bell
And it feels like the whole wide world is raining down on you
Oh, brought to you courtesy of the red, white, and blue
