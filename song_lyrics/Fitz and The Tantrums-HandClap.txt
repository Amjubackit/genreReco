[Intro]
Turn it up
[Verse 1: FITZ]
Somebody save your soul
'Cause you've been sinnin' in this city, I know
Too many troubles
All these lovers got you losing control
You're like a drug to me
A luxury, my sugar and gold
I want the good life
Every good night, you're a hard one to hold
[Refrain: FITZ]
'Cause you don't even know
I can make your hands clap
Said I can make your hands clap
[Verse 2: FITZ]
Somebody save your soul
'Cause you've been sinning in this city, I know
Too many troubles
All these lovers got you losing control
You're like a drug to me
A luxury, my sugar and gold
I want your sex and your affection
When they're holdin' you close (Ha, ha, ha)
