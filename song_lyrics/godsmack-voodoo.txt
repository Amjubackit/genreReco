[Chorus]
I'm not the one who's so far away
When I feel the snake bite enter my veins
Never did I wanna be here again
And I don't remember why I came
[Verse 1]
Candles raise my desire
Why I'm so far away
No more meaning to my life
No more reason to stay
[Pre-Chorus]
Freezin' feelin'
Breathe in, breathe in
I'm comin' back again
[Chorus]
I'm not the one who's so far away
When I feel the snake bite enter my veins
Never did I wanna be here again
And I don't remember why I came
[Verse 2]
Hazing clouds rain on my head
Empty thoughts fill my ears
Find my shade by the moonlight
Why my thoughts aren't so clear
[Pre-Chorus]
Demons dreamin'
Breathe in, breathe in
I'm comin' back again
[Chorus]
I'm not the one who's so far away
When I feel the snake bite enter my veins
Never did I wanna be here again
And I don't remember why I came
I'm not the one who's so far away
When I feel the snake bite enter my veins
Never did I wanna be here again
And I don't remember why I came
[Interlude]
Voodoo
Voodoo, voodoo, voodoo
[Chorus]
I'm not the one who's so far away
When I feel the snake bite enter my veins
Never did I wanna be here again
And I don't remember why I came
I'm not the one who's so far away
When I feel the snake bite enter my veins
Never did I wanna be here again
And I don't remember why I came
[Interlude]
Voodoo, voodoo
Voodoo, voodoo
Voodoo, voodoo
Voodoo, voodoo
[Outro]
(Voodoo) So far away...
(Voodoo) I'm not the one who's so far away
(Voodoo) I'm not the one who's so far away
I'm not the one who's so far away
