[Verse 1]
Wake up to a cloudy day
Dark rolls in and it starts to rain
Starin' out to the cage-like walls
Time goes by and the shadows crawl
Crushin' candy, crushin' pills
Got no job, mom pays my bills
Textin' exes, get my fill
Sweatin' bullets, Netflix chills
World's out there singin' the blues
Twenty more dead on the evening news
Think to myself, "Really, what's the use?"
I'm just like you, I was born to lose
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Why, oh, why can't you just fix me?
When all I want's to feel numb
But the medication's all gone
Why, oh, why does God hate me?
When all I want's to get high
And forget this so-called life
[Chorus]
I am so frickin' bored
Nothin' to do today
I guess I'll sit around and medicate (Medicate)
I am so frickin' bored
Nothin' to do today
I guess I'll sit around and medicate (Medicate)
