[Verse 1]
I can feel it in the future
I can see it in the culture
I see the moon as a sunrise
See the stars with my morning eyes
Like a bear in the forest
Like the heat in the conscience
I take a walk through the treeline
Gettin' on with Father Time
[Pre-Chorus]
When do I begin? (When do I)
[Chorus]
Oh my, oh my
Surefire, yeah, the setting sun is gonna set on me
[Verse 2]
I've been waiting for a long time
I've been waiting in the sunshine
Looking 'round like it's storming
Drying out like a histamine
I'm the warden on the front line
A yellow soldier on a dead mine
Listen, lover, won't you call me?
I'm a sucker for some harmony
