[Verse 1]
To the edge, until we all get off
I will take you away with me
Once and for all
[Chorus]
Time will see us realign
Diamonds rain across the sky
Shower me into the same realm
[Verse 2]
Calculate our embrace
Hold on, come with me now
Run away, outer space with me
Once and for all
[Chorus]
Time will see us realign
Diamonds rain across the sky
Shower me into the same realm
Time will see us realign
Diamonds rain across the sky
I will lead us to the same realm
[Bridge]
Get set[Verse 3]
When the coffin shakes
And the needle breaks
Come run away with me
Come on, you'll see
Once and for all
[Chorus]
Time will see us realign
Diamonds rain across the sky
Shower me into the same realm
[Outro]
Time will lead us to the same realm
I will lead us to the same realm
