[Verse 1]
Fame is in the front seat
Trouble with the kerb
Mama's in the back seat
Singing like a bird, oh no
Take me to the good life
Stranger on the mountain
Hanging on your words
Walking in a nightmare
Everything is blurred, oh no
Take me to the good times
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't forget what you told me
I'm a wolf in sheep's clothing
[Chorus]
Watching, waiting
My prey is praying
There's no escaping
My blood's pumping
I go on hunting
The hunter, the hunted
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oooh-oooh-oooh
