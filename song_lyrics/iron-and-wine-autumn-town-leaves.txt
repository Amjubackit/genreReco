[Verse 1]
In this autumn town where the leaves can fall
On either side of the garden wall
We laugh all night to keep the embers glowing
[Verse 2]
Some are leaping free from their moving cars
Stacking stones 'round their broken hearts
Waving down any wind that might come blowing
[Chorus 1]
Mice move out when the field is cut
Serpents curl when the sun comes up
Songbirds only end up where they're going
[Verse 3]
Some get rain and some get snow
Some want love and some want gold
I just want to see you in the morning
[Chorus 2]
Dogs lay down in the evening heat
Fish do worse when they leave the sea
Songbirds only end up where they're going
[Verse 4]
In this autumn town where the lights can change
Some get mercy and some get blame
Some get lost when they feel the river flowing[Verse 5]
It's all holy smoke and the flame dies fast
We hold our hats while the days fly past
Cold wind comes and we wave but it keeps going
[Chorus 3]
Fathers, Sons and Holy Ghosts
All come back or they all come close
Songbirds only end up where they're going
[Verse 6]
Some get hard and some go home
Some want flesh and some want bone
I just want to see you in the morning
[Outro]
Yeah, I just want to see you in the morning
