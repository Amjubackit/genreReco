[Verse 1]
You said that you'd never forget me
How could you leave me behind?
Promise me you’ll be there for the good
And there for the darkest nights
You said you'd swim the deepest oceans
Rip the stars right from the sky, oh
You said that you'd never forget me
We’d have each other for life
[Chorus]
I could paint over the scars
Take an arrow to the heart
No, I don't care where you've been
Just don't leavе me lonely again
I could learn to picturе you
From a different point of view
No, I don't care where you've been
Just don't leave me lonely again
Don't leave me lonely
[Drop]
Don’t leave me lonely, lonely
Don’t leave me lonely, lonely
Don't leave me lonely, lonely
Don’t leave me lonely, lonely[Verse 2]
You are my oxygen
But somehow you still make me forget to breathe, yeah
I'd crawl through hell again for you
'Cause it feels like heaven to me
I'd crush diamonds, run from sirens
Be the world beneath your feet, ooh, yeah
You said that you’d never forget me
I'm yours for eternity
[Chorus]
I could paint over the scars
Take an arrow to the heart
No, I don't care where you've been
Just don't leave me lonely again
I could learn to picture you
From a different point of view
No, I don't care where you've been
Just don't leave me lonely again
Don't leave me lonely
[Drop]
Don't leave me lonely, lonely
Don't leave me lonely, lonely
Don't leave me lonely, lonely
Don't leave me lonely, lonely
