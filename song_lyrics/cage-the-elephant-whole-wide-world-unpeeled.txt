[Verse 1]
When I was a young boy
My mama said to me
"There's only one girl in this world for you
And she probably lives in Tahiti"
[Interlude]
Go the whole wide world
I'd go the whole wide world
Just to find her
[Verse 2]
Or maybe she's in the Bahamas
Where the Caribbean Sea is blue
Weeping in the tropical, moonlit night
Because nobody's talking 'bout you
[Chorus]
I'd go the whole wide world
I'd go the whole wide world
Just to find her
I'd go the whole wide world
I'd go the whole wide world
To find out where they hide her
I'd go the whole wide world
I'd go the whole wide world
Just to find her
(Go! Hey!)[Verse 3]
Am I hanging around in the rain right here
Trying to pick up a girl?
Why are my eyes filling up with these lonely tears
When there's girls all over the world?
Is she lying on some tropical beach somewhere
Underneath a tropical sun?
Pining away in a heatwave there
Hoping that I won't be long
[Pre-Chorus]
I should be lying on that sun-swept beach with her
Caressing her warm, brown skin
And then in a year, or maybe not quite
We'll be sharing the same next of kin
[Chorus]
I'd go the whole wide world
I'd go the whole wide world
Just to find her
I'd go the whole wide world
I'd go the whole wide world
To find out where they hide her
I'd go the whole wide world
I'd the whole wide world
Just to find her
(Go! Woo!)[Chorus]
I'd go the whole wide world
I'd go the whole wide world
Just to find her
I'd go the whole wide world
I'd go the whole wide world
To find out where they hide her
I'd go the whole wide world
I'd go the whole wide world
Just to find her
I'd go the whole wide world
I'd go the whole wide world
To find out where they hide her
(Oh! Go!)
