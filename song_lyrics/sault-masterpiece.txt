[Chorus]
Time don't make it better
I just keep on fallin' for you
We change like the weather
I just can't keep waitin' for you
You can clearly see God made a masterpiece
And it's getting so hard trying to cope living without you
[Verse 1]
Ooh, please don't change your smile
You're the only one I love, please never doubt
That you're gonna be the only one for me
I've been sitting down waiting so desperately
[Chorus]
Time don't make it better
I just keep on fallin' for you
Ahh, we change like the weather
I just can't keep waitin' on you
You can clearly see God made a masterpiece
And it's getting so hard trying to cope breathin' without you
Ooh ooh ooh
[Verse 2]
Oh, I've got no fear in me
But it feels too good tryin' to make a scene
'Cause you got me feelin' high like a kite you see
If it don't make sense, it ain't meant to be[Chorus]
But tears don't make it better
I can't just keep fallin' for you
We change like the weather
I just can't keep fallin' on you
You can cleary see God made a masterpiece
And it's getting so hard trying to find a key
[Bridge]
If I wait any longer, my heart will bleed
Can't spend my whole life in a lucid dream
When my friends tell me that I got a love disease
'Cause I said I won't live if I have to do life
Without you
[Outro]

(Ahh ahh ahh)
(All I think about is you)
(Ahh ahh ahh)
(All I think about is you)
(Ahh ahh ahh)
(All I think about is you)
(Ahh ahh ahh)
(All I think about is you)
(Ahh ahh ahh)
(All I think about is you)
