[Intro]
Let's go
[Verse 1]
I wanna go to Ibiza (Let's go)
I wanna go to Argentina (Let's go)
Yeah, I wanna go and dance (D-d-d-d-dance)
I wanna dance in Paris, France (Let's go)
I wanna go around the world (Let's go)
And party with the girls (Let's go)
And when I get there, when I get there, when I'm there
I wanna go
[Chorus]
I wanna go crazy (I wanna go)
I wanna go crazy (I wanna go)
I wanna go crazy (I wanna go)
I wanna go crazy (That's where I wanna go)
I wanna go crazy (Yeah, I wanna go there)
I wanna go crazy (With you, girl, let's go)
[Verse 2]
I need to go, need to fuckin' go
Go and celebrate life with a suicide girl
I wanna go, go, now go
I'ma celebrate life with a suicide girl
I need to go, need to fuckin' go
I'ma celebrate life with a suicide girl (Girl)
I need g-g-g-go now go
Yeah, I'ma celebrate with a suicide girl
Hey!
[Chorus]
I wanna go crazy (Crazy in the US of A)
I wanna go crazy (Crazy in the USSR)
I wanna go crazy (Moscow, here I come)
I wanna go crazy (I wanna go)
I wanna go
And when I get there
Girl, when I get there, when I'm there, I wanna go-o-o-o-o
I wanna go
I wanna go
I wanna go cra-cra-cra-cra (Go)
[Verse 3]
Where I wanna go ain't geographical
You can't Google Map it, map-quest it when I go loco
If you need to know the destination, I'm going crazy
I ain't by myself, I'm coming with a whole bunch of ladies
Celebrating life to the max, these girls are suicidal
In the club sippin' bottle after bottle after bottle
Celebration never stoppin', situation club hoppin'
Simulation panty-droppin', penetration coochie-poppin'
Then I'm out
[Breakdown]
I need to go back to Mars
We 'bout to take off
In ten (Ten, ten)
Nine (Nine)
Eight
Seven
Six
Five (Five)
Four
Three
(Two) Two
One!
[Chorus]
I wanna go crazy (I wanna go, I wanna go)
I wanna go crazy (That's where I wanna go)
I wanna go crazy (That's where I wanna go)
I wanna go crazy (With you, girl, with you)
I wanna go crazy (With you, girl, with you)
I wanna go crazy (That's where I wanna go)
I wanna go cr-cra-cra-cra-cra-cra-cra-zy-zy-zy-zy-zy
