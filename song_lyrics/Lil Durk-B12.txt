[Verse 1]
McLaren Speedtail
Six carats in my ear for detail
I be gettin' all my watches retail
Caught a murder, he tryna call Meek Mill
Sold him lean, but Doodie got his refill
I know real killers act like females
All the trenches bitches give me tea still
How you kill him? Bro, I need the details
Adderall, feel like it’s mixed with B12
You kept tellin' all my secrets, be real
Headshot, stop runnin', be still
I could shake a whole block with these pills
This a striker, I don’t know why you need L's
Pull up to a whole mosque and pray still
Follow bro car 'cause he got the switch
Only poppin' 'cause you died and you diss
Crush a Perc' inside a Sierra Mist
Bitch was poppin', had to give her a kiss
I ain't puttin’ my name on hits
Why you braggin’? Niggas ain't kill shit
Hopped out on feet like he ran out of gas
I call him Yeat ’cause he stay with his mask
How you got it, but you stay with your mans?
Legs tatted, had to go get some Vans
Fifteen million cash, that's my advance
Fuck a opp bitch to get in her head
Think I love her, I'm tryna plot on her man
Think I love her, I'm tryna kill his ass
You a killer? Jam, check his referral
Flawless diamonds, you rock it better with curls
On a date, I gotta take her to Harold’s
These Chanel, these ain't regular pearls
