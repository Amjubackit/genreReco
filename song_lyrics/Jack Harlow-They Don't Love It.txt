[Intro]
Can't live without you, baby
Live without you
It’s like (
Oh, baby
)
[Verse 1]
I been smooth for so long, I'm tryna get rough
Fuck buffin' my nails, dawg, I’m tryna get buff
Fuck shapin' my beard up, I'm likin' the scruff
And fuck the hills 'cause I'm livin' my life in the cut
Can't imagine that I’m gon’ meet my wife in the club
We gon' see though, I feel like she more of a CEO
Or maybe she doin’ volunteer work in Rio
It's not like I need her but I would love to meet her
Another day, another dollar, another phone with another feature
I don't play goalie but I'm my brother’s keeper
Surrounded by family, I'm not with other people
They say I got my pops' demeanor and mother's features
The Garden still Private as ever, the gang thrivin' together
Ya boy's strivin' to be the most dominant ever
The hardest white boy since the one who rapped about vomit and sweaters
And hold the comments 'cause I promise you I'm honestly better than whoever came to your head right then
They ain't cut from the same thread like him
They don't study, doin' work to get ahead like him
They don't toss and turn in the fuckin' bed like him
