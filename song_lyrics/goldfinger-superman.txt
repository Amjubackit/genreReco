[Intro]
Chick-a-cha, chick-a-cha, chick-a-cha
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up!
So here I am, doing everything I can
Holding on to what I am, pretending I'm a superman
[Verse 1]
I'm trying to keep the ground on my feet
It seems the world's falling down around me
The nights are all long, I'm singing this song
To try and make the answers more than maybe
[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm so confused about what to do
Sometimes I wanna throw it all away
[Chorus]
So here I am, growing older all the time
Looking older all the time, feeling younger in my mind
And here I am, doing everything I can
Holding on to what I am, pretending I'm a superman
[Verse 2]
I'm trying to sleep, I lost count of sheep
My mind is racing faster every minute
What could I do more? Yeah, I'm really not sure
I know I'm running circles but I can't quit
[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm so confused about what to do
Sometimes I wanna throw it all away
[Bridge]
Controlling everything in sight, feeling weak, I don't feel right
You're telling me I have to change, telling me to act my age
But if all that I can do is just sit and watch time go
Then I'll have to say goodbye, life's too short to watch it fly
To watch it fly
[Chorus]
So here I am, growing older all the time
Looking older all the time, feeling younger in my mind
And here I am, doing everything I can
Holding on to what I am, pretending I'm a superman
