[Intro: Cody Carson, 
Cody Carson & Scene Queen
]
Hey, Hannah, I-I mean Scene Queen
There's a song that I need you on
Like now
Let's party
[Verse 1: Scene Queen & 
Cody Carson
]
You're so bold, screaming your opinions out your window
Just so I can't hear 'em, you won't get close
And say it with your chest
You hate to see me get, you hate to see me get
Get above your lowbrow, toxic trash
I'll turn around so you can kiss my ass
I'm out in front, you're just my backing track
So send your empty threats, I love when you're upset, I'll
[Pre-Chorus: Cody Carson & 
Scene Queen
]
Kick two feet inside your mouth, you're spittin' 'em out, win-win
Crack my fist, I'm breakin' out that coffin you put me in
Swish some bleach inside your mouth, two times around, win-win
Crawlin' out from underground, 'cause bitch, wе're back again
Boo
[Chorus: Cody Carson, 
Scene Queen
, 
Both
]
You're going for blood, 
that's so adorable
You'rе cuttin' me up, 
you're so hysterical
So say what ya want, 
it's your memorial
Be mad, stay mad, win-win like that[Post-Chorus: Both]
W-I-N, W-I-N, win-win
W-I-N, W-I-N, win-win
[Verse 2: Scene Queen & 
Cody Carson
]
A bunch of whiny little bitches, could be gone, you choose to witness
Let me occupy your mind because you never mind your business
Is my success makin' you pressed? You're just too stressed?
Try to suck less, but I won't hold my breath
Look stupid, I'm ruthless, I'm massive, big unit
You talk shit, go toothless, can't hear you, you're muted, hush
[Chorus: Cody Carson, 
Scene Queen
, 
Both
]
You're going for blood, 
that's so adorable
You're cuttin' me up, 
you're so hysterical
So say what ya want, 
it's your memorial
Be mad, stay mad, win-win like that
[Bridge: Both]
Boo
W-I-N, W-I-N

You're going for blood, 
that's so adorable
You're cuttin' me up, 
you're so hysterical
So say what ya want,

Be mad, stay mad, win-win like that
You're going for blood, 
that's so adorable
You're cuttin' me up, 
you're so hysterical
So say what ya want, 
it's your memorial
Be mad, stay mad, win-win like that[Post-Chorus: Both]
W-I-N, W-I-N, win-win
W-I-N, W-I-N, win-win
W-I-N, W-I-N, win-win
Be mad, stay mad, win-win like that
