[Intro]
Gorgeous
[Verse 1]
You should take it as a compliment
That I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk
You should think about the consequence
Of your magnetic field being a little too strong
And I got a boyfriend, he's older than us
He's in the club doin' I don't know what
You're so cool, it makes me hate you so much (I hate you so much)
[Pre-Chorus]
Whisky on ice, Sunset and Vine
You've ruined my life by not being mine
[Chorus]
You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face
'Cause look at your face (
Gorgeous
)
And I'm so furious
At you for making me feel this way
But what can I say?
You're gorgeous
[Verse 2]
You should take it as a compliment
That I'm talking to everyone here but you (But you, but you)
And you should think about the consequence
Of you touching my hand in a darkened room (Dark room, dark room)
If you've got a girlfriend, I'm jealous of her
But if you're single that's honestly worse
'Cause you're so gorgeous it actually hurts (Honey, it hurts)
