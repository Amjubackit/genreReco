[Intro]
Walk right in all you sinners and saints
Tonight's the night we're gonna take off these chains
Some wounds will never mend
It came with a warning, now we're all out of time
This romance with ignorance has left us behind
[Pre-Chorus]
Sit back, relax, begin
[Chorus]
It's too early for surrender
Too late for a prayer
We can't go to hell if we're already there
They say the end is coming
And I need to prepare
We can't go to hell if we're already there
[Verse]
It's no mystery, what can I say, we're blind by design
And history keeps getting paid to change it's mind
Some wounds will never mend
Divided by deception, but together we must rise
Deafened by the naive while we silence the wise
[Pre-Chorus]
So sit back, relax, begin
[Chorus]
It's too early for surrender
Too late for a prayer
We can't go to hell if we're already there
They say the end is coming
And I need to prepare
We can't go to hell if we're already there
[Bridge]
Turn that fear into a souvenir
The world is waiting and the hour's near
So if you need a reason
If you need a sign
Open up you're eyes
You'll see they stole your water
Turned it into wine
[Pre-Chorus]
Sit back, relax, begin
[Chorus]
It's too early for surrender
Too late for a prayer
We can't go to hell if we're already there
They say the end is coming
And I need to prepare
We can't go to hell if we're already there
It's too early for surrender
Too late for a prayer
We can't go to hell if we're already there
They say the end is coming
And I need to prepare
We can't go to hell if we're already there
