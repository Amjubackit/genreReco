So glad I made it, I made it through In spite of the storm and rain
Heartache and pain, still I'm declaring that I made it through
See, I didn't lose, experience lost at a major cost
But I never lost faith in you
So if you see me cry it's just a sign
That I'm, I'm still alive, I got some scars, but I'm still alive
In spite of calamity He still has a plan for me
And it's working for my good and it's building my testimony
So glad I made it, I made it through
In spite of the storm and rain, heartache and pain
I'm still alive to say I made it through, I didn't lose
Experienced lost at a major cost but I never lost faith in You
I'm so glad I made it, so glad I made it
I made it through, I made it through
So glad I made it, so glad I made it
I made it through, I made it through, ooh
So glad I made it, so glad I made it
I made it through, I made it through, ooh
So glad I made it, so glad I made it
I made it through, I made it through, ooh
So glad I made it, so glad I made it
I made it through, I made it through, ooh
So glad I made it, so glad I made it
I made it through, I made it through, ooh
So glad I made it, so glad I made it, I made it through, ooh
So if you see me cry it's just a sign that I'm, I'm still alive
I got some scars but I'm still alive
In spite of calamity He still has a plan for me, it's working out
