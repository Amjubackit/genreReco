[Verse 1]
I will give some worn down excuse
'Bout my misguided judgements of substance abuse
I know that you'll stay out of pure sympathy
There ain't no use in lovin' a let down like me
[Chorus]
I'll let you down darlin', down babe
Just like I did before
You'll just keep on slammin' closed hollow unlocked doors
I'll let you down darlin', down babe
Just like times before
And you'll just keep on crawin' back and beggin' me for more
[Verse 2]
I will leave you broken and in ruins
Call you when the works through just to find out what you're doin'
So I can let you down for the hundredth last time
'Causе lettin' downs a pick me up for me and my boys' kind
[Chorus]
I'll lеt you down darlin', down babe
Just like I did before
You'll just keep on slammin' closed hollow unlocked doors
I'll let you down darlin', down babe
Just like times before
And you'll just keep on crawlin' back and beggin' me for more
