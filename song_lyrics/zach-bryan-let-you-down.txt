[Verse 1]
I will give some worn down excuse
'Bout my misguided judgements of substance abuse
I know that you'll stay out of pure sympathy
There ain't no use in lovin' a let down like me
[Chorus]
I'll let you down darlin', down babe
Just like I did before
You'll just keep on slammin' closed hollow unlocked doors
I'll let you down darlin', down babe
Just like times before
And you'll just keep on crawin' back and beggin' me for more
[Verse 2]
I will leave you broken and in ruins
Call you when the works through just to find out what you're doin'
So I can let you down for the hundredth last time
'Causе lettin' downs a pick me up for me and my boys' kind
[Chorus]
I'll lеt you down darlin', down babe
Just like I did before
You'll just keep on slammin' closed hollow unlocked doors
I'll let you down darlin', down babe
Just like times before
And you'll just keep on crawlin' back and beggin' me for more
[Verse 3]
And I know that you know that you make my spine shiver
But my past lives inside me and it's branched out from my liver
But I am not the evil that you make me out to be
I will let you down and that's a damn guarantee
[Chorus]
I'll let you down darlin', down babe
Just like I did before
You'll just keep on slammin' closed hollow unlocked doors
I'll let you down darlin', down babe
Just like times before
And you'll just keep on crawin' back and beggin' me for more
[Outro]
I will give a worn down excuse
'Bout my misguided judgement of substance abuse
