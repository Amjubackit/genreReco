[Verse 1: Luke Smallbone]
Sharp stones, broke bones
Truth hurts, yeah, you know
You tried, backfired
You and your busted soul
[Verse 2: Luke & Joel Smallbone]
Lost love, set back
Tough luck, off track
Rain clouds on your head
Everywhere you go
[Pre-Chorus: Joel Smallbone & 
Luke Smallbone
]
Tears come but joy will follow (
Follow
)
Like lightning, then the rainbow (
Rainbow
)
Like darkness, then the day show (
Day shows
)
Yeah, the best is yet to come
[Chorus: Joel & Luke Smallbone, 
Joel Smallbone
]
Never ever, ever, ever, ever give up
Never ever, ever, ever give up, no
Never ever, ever, ever, ever give up
Never ever, ever, ever give up
Never give up
Never give up[Verse 3: Luke & Joel Smallbone]
When gravity pins you down
Find your feet, yeah, stand your ground
Set your eyes on the sky
Stronger than you know
[Pre-Chorus: Joel & Luke Smallbone, 
Luke Smallbone
]
Tears come but joy will follow (
Follow
)
Like lightning, then the rainbow (
Rainbow
)
Like darkness, then the day show (
Day shows
)
Yeah, the best is yet to come
[Chorus: Joel & Luke Smallbone, 
Joel Smallbone
]
Never ever, ever, ever, ever give up
Never ever, ever, ever give up, no
Never ever, ever, ever, ever give up
Never ever, ever, ever give up
Never give up
Never give up
[Post-Chorus: Luke & Joel Smallbone]
Don't you ever give up, no, keep your head down
You're so much closer than you know right now
Don't you ever give up 'cause it's turnin' around
Don't you ever give up, no, keep your head down
You're so much closer than you know right now
Don't you ever give up 'cause it's turnin' around[Bridge: Joel Smallbone, 
Joel & Luke Smallbone
]
Never ever surrender
Never, no, never surrender
Never ever surrender
Never surrender
Never, never surrender
Never, no, never surrender
Never, never surrender
No
[Chorus: Joel & Luke Smallbone, 
Joel Smallbone
]
Never ever, ever, ever, ever give up
Never ever, ever, ever give up, no
Never ever, ever, ever, ever give up
Never ever, ever, ever give up
Never give up
Never ever, ever, ever, ever give up
Never ever, ever, ever give up, no
Never ever, ever, ever, ever give up
Never ever, ever, ever give up
Never give up
Never give up
[Post-Chorus: Luke & Joel Smallbone]
'Cause don't you ever give up, no, keep your head down
You're so much closer than you know right now
Don't you ever give up 'cause it's turnin' around
Don't you ever give up, no, keep your head down
You're so much closer than you know right now
Don't you ever give up 'cause it's turnin' around[Outro: Joel & Luke Smallbone]
Never give up, no
Never give up, no
No, never give up, no
Never give up
