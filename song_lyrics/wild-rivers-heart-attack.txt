I step back just to frame it
And I didn't know too much
Narrowed my eyes, tried to cut through lies
I was losing touch
Darlin’ I didn't know nothing
Hit like a head full of wine
Came like a curse, I was down in the first
You didn't use your ride
Oh my, you just gotta take a piece of me
Try to tease out the other side
Cause darlin’ I just see you've been so sweet to me
I've been waiting on the day all night
Would it kill you for some peace of mind?
Would you take me and not look back?
Good gracious, you're a heart attack
We were something like a movie
But she was more of a show
Spread roots wide in the back of my eyes
And she never let it slow
I had my hand full of aces
Ran her fingers down the back of my neck
I stepped back when she laid down that Jack
I was losing breath
Oh my, you just gotta take a piece of me
Try to tease out the other side
Cause darlin’ I just see you've been so sweet to me
I've been waiting on the day all night
Would it kill you for some peace of mind?
Would you take me and not look back?
Good gracious, you're a heart attack
