[Verse]
I was born by the river
In a little tent
And just like river, baby
I've been running ever since
[Chorus]
It's been a long
Long time coming
And I know
Change is gonna come
[Verse 2]
It's been too hard living
But I'm afraid to die
Cause I don't know what's up there,  baby
Beyond the sky
[Chorus]
It's been a long
Long time coming
And I know
Change is gonna come
[Verse 3]
Well, I go down to my brother
And I say
Brother, help me please, yeah
But he winds up
Knocking me back down
On my knees, yeah
Yeah!
