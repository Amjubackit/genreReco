There were dangers awaiting me
Destruction was sure to be
But thank God for angels
That were shielding and protecting
And looking out for me
Thank You, Lord
The Devil had a plan to kill me, I know
But God intercepted his plan
And told the Devil, "No"
God blocked it
He wouldn't let it be so
No, He wouldn't let it be so
Haven't lived a perfect life
Seems I've done wrong more than I've done right
But thank God for compassion and forgiveness
That kept me from a terrible plight
You see
My life was spinning out of control
The fact that I'm still a live today
Ain't nothing, nothing but a miracle
God blocked it
He wouldn't let it be so
No, He wouldn't let it be so
For I've got work to do, work to do
God wouldn't let me die
Because He knew I had work to do
Oh yes
And I've got life to live
There are blessings
He want is to give
God blocked it
He wouldn't let me fall
No, He wouldn't let it be so
God blocked it
He wouldn't let it be so
It was the Lord
Nobody but Jesus
