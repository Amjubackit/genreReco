Would you mind if I touched, if I kiss
If I held you tight in the morning light? Yeah
Would you mind if I said
How I felt tenderly tonight again?
'Cause I never ever (Never felt)
Felt this way in my heart before, oh
Love has found its way
In my heart, yeah
Would you mind if I looked in your eyes
'Til I'm hypnotized and I lose my pride, yeah
Would you mind (Hey, do you mind?) if I made love to you
Till I'm satisfied once again?
'Cause I never ever felt (Ever felt)
Felt this way in my heart oh before, oh
Love has found its way (Oh)
In my heart tonight
