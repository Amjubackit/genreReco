[Verse 1]
Pull me in closer, close to Your heart
May I be a pure reflection of all You are
Love that is patient, love that is kind
And love that keeps no offenses or wrongs in mind
Make me like Jesus
Make me like Jesus
[Chorus]
My heart is an open space
For You to come and have Your way
I'm open, I'm o...o-o-o-open
My heart is an open space
For You to come and have Your way
I'm open, I'm o...o-o-o-open
[Verse 2]
You're faithful to find me, right where I am
Though even in my wandering, You call me friend
And mercy receives me and lifts me to my feet
And I'm caught up in the wonder and mystery
Of knowing Jesus
Of knowing Jesus
[Chorus]
My heart is an open space
For You to come and have Your way
I'm open, I'm o...o-o-o-open
My heart is an open space
For You to come and have Your way
I'm o...o-o-open, I'm o...o-o-o-open[Bridge 1]
Do whatever You wanna do
And say whatever You wanna say
And move however You wanna move
And change whatever You wanna change
Do whatever You wanna do
And say whatever You wanna say
And move however You wanna move, God
And change whatever You wanna change
[Chorus]
My heart is an open space
For You to come and have Your way
I'm open, I'm o...o-o-o-open
My heart is an open space
For You to come and have Your way
I am o...o-o-open, I am...oo-oo-ooh (open)
[Bridge 2]
What are You saying? Where are You going?
My heart is open wide and my eyes are open wide
What are You saying? Where are You go-o-o-ing?
My heart is open wide, my eyes are open wide, 
come on
What are You saying? Where are You go-o-o-ing?
My heart is open wide, my eyes are open wide
What are You saying? Where are You go-o-o-ing?
My heart is open wide, my eyes are open wide
What are You saying? Where are You go-o-o-ing?
My heart is open wide, my eyes are open wide
What are You saying? Where are You go-o-o-ing?
My heart is open wide, my eyes are open wide[Chorus]
And my heart is an open space
For You to come and have Your way
I'm open, I'm o...o-o-open
My heart is an open space
For You to come and have Your way
I'm o...o-o-open, I'm o...o-o-open
