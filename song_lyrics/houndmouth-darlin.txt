[Verse 1]
Well, I ain't got a kiss left to give ya
'Cause you weren't good to me
Well, I ain't got no news left to feed ya
'Cause you weren't good to me
It's cold, it's dark, it's deep, and it's wet
But you ain't gonna make it if you don't
Let someone in
[Chorus]
Well, darlin', darlin', darlin'
Why don't you sleep at night?
The colder the heart (Ooo)
The warmer the gun
[Verse 2]
Shot gun Alynda, bring me your eyes
For I wish to see like you
You're looking froze and weathered, my dear
And your lips and your cheeks are turnin' blue
It's cold, it's dark, it's deep, and it's wet
But you ain't gonna make it if you don't
Let someone in
[Chorus]
Well, darlin', darlin', darlin'
Why don't you sleep at night?
The colder the heart (Ooo)
The warmer the gun
Darlin', darlin', darlin'
Why don't you sleep at night?
The colder the heart (Yeah, yeah-eah-eah)
The warmer the gun
