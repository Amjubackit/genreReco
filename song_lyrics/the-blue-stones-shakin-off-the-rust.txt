[Verse 1]
Bang my head against the wall
Try to find my stride, but I trip and I fall
Losing my attention again
Yeah, I hit the bottom, but I'm on the mend
[Pre-Chorus]
I get up
Take another step, push it to the edge
I get up
Just a little more, I can see the end
I get up
Yeah, you're finished, yeah, you're mine, always win in due time
[Chorus]
You think too much, it's in my head
So I'm shaking off the rust and
You got no trust, it's in my head
So I'm shaking off the rust
I think I broke just a little bit
Walked through the fire, made it back again
Lord knows I tried everything I can
Now I'm shaking off the rust
(I'm shaking off the rust)
[Verse 2]
Bang my head against the wall
Try to hold a smile, but I'm sick of it all
Everyone with something to say
Better hold my tongue or I'll make my mistake
[Pre-Chorus]
I get up
Show 'em what I do, show 'em how it's done
I get up
Never turn it down, never gonna run, I learn
[Chorus]
You think too much, it's in my head
So I'm shaking off the rust and
You got no trust, it's in my head
So I'm shaking off the rust
I think I broke just a little bit
Walked through the fire, made it back again
Lord knows I tried everything I can
Now I'm shaking off the rust
(I'm shaking off the rust)
[Bridge]
(I'm, oh)
(I'm shaking off the rust)
[Chorus]
You think too much, it's in my head
So I'm shaking off the rust and
You got no trust, it's in my head
Now I'm shaking off the rust
I think I broke just a little bit
Walked through the fire, made it back again
Lord knows I tried everything I can
And I'm shaking off the rust
Yeah, I'm shaking off the rust
