[Verse 1]
Why can't you love me like I need you to?
It's such a simple task at hand
Well you can't cure a broken man
Or mend his gun hot hands
And I am still the same kid you fell for when we were young
How come every song I sing you say has already been sung?
And I feel like a nuisance in my own damn mind
When I speak you say it's too much, when I scream you say I've lost my mind
[Chorus]
So don't call in the mornin' 'cause I'll already be gone
Oklahoma in the summertime's where my country ass belongs
Love is patient, love is kind
, should not make you lose your mind
Thеre's got to be more to this than bеin' pissed off all the time
All the time
[Verse 2]
Why can't I love you like you need me to?
It seems we just oppose
I'll just head out on the town for deja vu until they close
[Chorus]
So don't call in the mornin' 'cause I'll already be gone
Oklahoma in the summertime's where my country ass belongs
Love is patient, love is kind, should not make you lose your mind
There's got to be more to this than bein' pissed off all the time
All the time
