[Verse 1: Brad Petering]
Are you sick of me?
Would you like to be?
I'm tryna tell you something
Something that I already said
You like the pretty boy
With a pretty voice
Who was tryna sell you something
Something that you already had
[Chorus: Brad Petering, 
Brad Petering & F
aith Harding
]
But if you're too drunk to drive
And the music is right
She might let you stay
But just for the night
And if she grabs for your hand
And drags you along
She might want a kiss
Before the end of the song
Because love can burn like a cigarette
And leave you alone with nothing
And leave you alone with nothing
[Verse 2: Brad Petering]
While the others talked
We were listening to Lovers' Rock
In her bedroom
In her bedroom
And if you start to kiss
And the record skips
Flip it over
And sit a little closer
