[Verse 1]
Hope this is the last time, 'cause I'd never say no to you
This conversation's been dead on arrival
And there's no way to talk to you
This conversation's been dead on
[Pre-Chorus]
A rivalry goes so deep
Between me and this loss of sleep over you
[Chorus]
This is side one, flip me over
I know I'm not your favorite record
The songs you grow to like never stick at first
So I'm writing you a chorus, and here is your verse
[Verse 2]
No, it's not the last time, 'cause I'd never say no to you
This conversation's still dead on arrival
And there's no way to talk to you
When you're dead on
[Pre-Chorus]
A rivalry goes so deep
Between me and this loss of sleep over you[Chorus]
This is side one, flip me over
I know I'm not your favorite record
The songs you grow to like never stick at first
So I'm writing you a chorus, and here is your, whoo!
[Bridge]
This is side one, flip me over
I know I'm not your favorite record, no
So, this is side one
Flip me over
[Chorus]
This is side one, flip me over
I know I'm not your favorite record
The songs you grow to like never stick at first
So I'm writing you a chorus, and here is your verse
[Outro]
Here is yourâ€¦
Dead on!
