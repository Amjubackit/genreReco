[Verse 1]
Waiting, in the quiet place
Longing for embrace, Lord, I look to You
You're faithful, to reveal Your heart
From the very start I was meant for You
I am waiting, in the quiet place
Longing for embrace, Lord, I look to You
You're faithful, to reveal Your heart
From the very start I was meant for You
[Chorus]
Oh, You opened up the heavens
And You rained down Your love
Father, my heart is toward You
And You're more than enough
[Verse 2]
I am resting, in Your love for me
Open up and receive, Lord, I look to You
And Your water, it washes over me
For eternity, I just wanna sing oh-oh
[Chorus]
Oh, You opened up the heavens oh-oh-oh
And You rained down Your love (You rained down Your love)
Father, my heart is toward You, yeah-yeah
You're more than enough
You're more than enough (More than enough)
[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh, yeah-yeah You're more than enough
Oh-oh, You're more than enough
[Bridge]
You are my inheritance
You hold my world inside Your hands
You are my inheritance
You hold my world inside Your hands
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Yeah-yeah
[Chorus]
You opened up the heavens, Jesus
And You rained down Your love (You rained down Your love)
You rained down Your love
Father, my heart is toward You, toward You yeah
You're more than enough, You're more than enough
You opened up the heavens, yeah
And You rained down Your love (You rained down Your love)
Father, my heart is toward You, toward You
You're more than enough
[Outro]
Oh, You opened up the heavens, Jesus
And You rained down Your love, You rained down
Father, my heart is toward You, toward You yeah
You're more than enough, You're more than enough (You're more than enough)
You opened up the heavens, yeah
You rained down Your love (You rained down Your love)
Father, my heart is toward You, toward You
You're more than enough
