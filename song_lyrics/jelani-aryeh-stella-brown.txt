[Chorus]
Stella Brown
I don’t know what to talk about
How has my head just hollowed out
?
Thoughts use to orbit all around
On Venus we could find peace
Stella Brown
I don’t know what you want to talk about
I'm too precautious and I often doubt
How can I be the boy you dream about
Stella Brown
[Verse 1]
Fall for every woman on my set
I tend to play out what we’d be like in a sec
These words don’t
These words don’t like to leave, ooh
I see our end immediately
So I keep to myself
Ooh, and I
[Chorus]
Stella Brown
I don’t know what to talk about
How has my head just hollowed out?
Thoughts use to orbit all around
On Venus we could find peace
Stella brown
I don’t know what you want to talk about
I'm too precautious and I often doubt
How can I be the boy you dream about
Stella Brown[Verse 2]
They’re all brunette
'Bout 5’4
She’s so herself
I see her core
Adjust my belt
Eyes to the floor
[Verse 3]
Spend my time
Awaiting lying patient
Inside this racing mind
They loved me good
I raised me right
Those days are gone
A phase behind us all
[Bridge]
All, all, all, no
[Chorus]
Stella Brown
I don’t know what to talk about
How has my head just hollowed out?
Thoughts use to orbit all around
On Venus we could find peace
Stella brown
I don’t know what you want to talk about
I'm too precautious and I often doubt
How can i be the boy you dream about
Stella Brown
