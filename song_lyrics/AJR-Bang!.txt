[Verse 1]
I get up, I get down
And I'm jumpin' around
And the rumpus and ruckus are comfortable now
Been a hell of a ride
But I'm thinking it's time to grow
Bang! Bang! Bang!
So I got an apartment across from the park
Put quinoa in my fridge
Still, 
I'm not feeling grown
Been a hell of a ride
But I'm thinking it's time to go
Bang! Bang! Bang! (
Here we go!
)
[Chorus]
So put your best face on everybody
Pretend you know this song everybody
Come hang (Come hang)
Let's go out with a bang!
Bang! Bang! Bang!
I'm way too young to lie here forever
I'm way too old to try so whatever
Come hang
Let's go out with a bang
Bang! Bang! Bang!
