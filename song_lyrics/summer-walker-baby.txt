[Verse]
You got my heart working overtime
You got my mind going crazy
Either way, long you alive, you my baby
Said my heart working overtime
Got my mind going crazy, ooh
Either way, long you alive, you my baby
But I know, but I know, but I know, you're mine, yeah
Hey baby, ooh
And I just can't get right to it, ooh
If you leave I just might lose it, lose it, oh woah oh
I just can't get right to it, ooh
Baby if you leave I just might lose it
