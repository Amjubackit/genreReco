[Verse 1]
You swear that you're stayin' single, next thing you know
You meet a girl at a bar and next thing you know
You get her laughin', it's 2AM
You're tellin' your buddies, three months in
That she ain't movin' in, the next thing you know
There's a U-Haul trailer, the next thing you know
Your old apartment, is y'all's new place
There goes the carpet but the deer head stays
[Chorus]
Next thing you know
You're savin' money like never before, just to
Spend it all at a jewelry store
Gettin' down on one knee on hеr mama's porch
Just prayin' she don't say, "No"
Next thing you know
Your best man givеs a half-drunk speech and you're
Sunburnt on a honeymoon beach and your
Left hand's gettin' used to that ring
And there the next two or three years go
Next thing you know
[Verse 2]
You weren't really tryin', next thing you know
There's a test on the counter, next thing you know
She's standin' there cryin', noddin' her head yes
You're half excited, half scared to death
