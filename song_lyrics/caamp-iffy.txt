[Verse 1]
Asking for forgiveness, so forgive me for my faults
And I hope you never get this but I sent it to your door
And I’ve crossed that Mississippi at least three times before
Oh no, without your love I can’t go back there no more
Said oh no, without your love I can’t go back there no more
[Verse 2]
Locked up all your windows and bolted all your doors
And I’ve had some trouble listening, my ears glued to the floor
And oh no, you won't see me again, least a year or more
Said my bags are all packed, and my shoes are by the back door
Said my bags, they are all packed, and my shoes are by the back door
[Chorus]
And you’ve stolen and wasted all my time
And you've stolen and wasted all my time
And you've stolen and wasted all my time, time, time
Oh, I hope you never get this, for a long, long while
[Verse 3]
These days I’m a mountain man with no one to forgive
Eating soul food out of tin cans is one way you can live
Oh I let you get real close and then give you the slip
I’m just a little twig floatin' down the big ole riv
Said now I’m just a little twig floatin' down the big ole riv[Chorus]
And you’ve stolen and wasted all my time
And you've stolen and wasted all my time
And you've stolen and wasted all my time, time, time
Oh, I hope you never get this, for a long, long while
[Bridge]
Now you stand in place
And watch those planes roll by on the tarmac
And I’ll lie to your face
And tell you I’ll be right back
And disappear
[Chorus]
'Cause you’ve stolen and wasted all my time
And you've stolen and wasted all my time
Said you've stolen and wasted all my time
Said you've stolen and wasted all my time
Said you've stolen and wasted all my time, time, time
Oh, I hope you never get this
