Verse 1: I don’t like to rush things oh no
I don’t really move like that
Tonight may love your company
And tomorrow may never call you back
And I just like to have my fun yeah
Keep it simple no strings attached
We could go out for food and drinks that’s it
I’m fine with that
I could go home get in my jammies
Already told you
Can’t meet my family
So quit asking
Don’t need my address
Don’t get on Facebook thinking you can change my status
Chorus: I’ll take my beer I'll take my Netflix
Don’t need your cooking I’ll make my own breakfast
Probably get Postmates I’m kinda lazy
I wouldn’t date you even if you paid me
I’ll take my beer I’ll take my whiskey
You can kiss me but don’t do it like you miss me
And when thе suns down I’m good to cuddle
But if you touch me while I’m sleeping it’s a no no
Oh noVеrse 2: I don’t really like body heat you can miss me with that
If you don’t like to sleep with a fan on you well that’s too bad
And I don’t like to share my covers need every inch and that’s a fact
And if you got a problem with it you could always Uber back
To your car where you could head home
So I can sleep here comfy and alone
So quit askin’ yeah this is madness
Don’t get on one knee thinking you could change my last name
Chorus: I’ll take my beer I'll take my Netflix
Don’t need your cooking I’ll make my own breakfast
Probably get Postmates I’m kinda lazy
I wouldn’t date you even if you paid me
I’ll take my beer I’ll take my whiskey
You can kiss me but don’t do it like you miss me
And when the suns down I’m good to cuddle
But if you touch me while I’m sleeping it’s a no no
Oh no
