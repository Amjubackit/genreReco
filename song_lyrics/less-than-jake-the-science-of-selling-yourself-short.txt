[Verse 1]
I've come to my senses
That I've become senseless
And I could give you lessons
How to ruin your friendships
And every last conviction
Yeah, I smoked them all away
And I drank my frustrations
Down the drain, out of the way
[Pre-Chorus]
And so I sit and wait and wonder
"Does anyone else feel like me?"
Someone so tired of their routines
And disappearing self-esteems
[Chorus]
I'll sing along
Yeah, with every emergency
Just sing along
And I'm the king of catastrophes
I'm so far gone
That deep down inside
I think it's fine by me
I'm my own worst enemy[Verse 2]
I could be an expert
On co-dependency
And I could write the best book
On underage tragedy
And I've been spending my time
Yeah, at the local liquor store
And I've been sleeping nightly
On my best friend's kitchen floor
[Pre-Chorus]
So I sit and wait and wonder
"Does anyone else feel like me?"
I'm so over-dosed on apathy
And burnt out on sympathy
[Chorus]
I'll sing along
Yeah, with every emergency
Just sing along
And I'm the king of catastrophes
I'm so far gone
That deep down inside
I think it's fine by me
That I'm my own worst enemy[Bridge]
Let the meaning slip away
I lost my faith in another day
Self-deprecation seems okay
I never thought I'd make it anyway, whoa-ho
[Chorus]
I'll sing along
Yeah, with every emergency
Just sing along
And I'm the king of catastrophes
I'm so far gone
That deep down inside
I think it's fine by me
I'm my own worst enemy
[Outro]
That I'm my own worst enemy
'Cause I'm my own worst enemy
And I'm my own worst enemy
'Cause I'm my own worst enemy
And I'm my own worst enemy
