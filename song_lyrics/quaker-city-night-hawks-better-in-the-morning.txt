The vampires living in my building
Go out every night at ten
They hang out at a bar around the corner
Where the whiskey makes the blood so thin
I’m tired of living in the moment
Downtown of some hot city
Fear swells until its over flowing
Causing doubt in everyone I meet
Causing doubt in everyone I meet
But the way I see it, why do today what
I’ll do better in the morning
I’ll do better in the morning
I’ll do better in the morning
This town could use a little music
A new sound put to some old memory
You'd do well if nobody even noticed
Make you doubt everything you see
But the way I see it, why do today what
I’ll do better in the morning
I’ll do better in the morning
I’ll do better in the morning
I’ll do better in the morning
I’ll do better in the morning
I’ll do better in the morning
I’ll do better in the morning
