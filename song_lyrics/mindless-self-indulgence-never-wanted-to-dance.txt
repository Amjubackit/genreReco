[Pre-Chorus]
There is nothing you can do that I have not already done to myself
There is nothing you can do that I have not already done to myself
There is nothing you can do that I have not already done to myself
No, there is nothing you can do that I have not already done to myself
[Chorus]
Never wanted to dance with nobody, not you
(Do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do do-do)
Never wanted to dance with nobody, but you
(Do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do do-do)
Never wanted to dance with nobody
But you wouldn't take no for an answer, you fucking bitch
[Verse]
Be nice, be nice to me
Don't let me be
Be nice, be nice to me
Don't let me go, don't let me go
I'm too cool for the second grade
I'm amazed, I'm afraid
I'm too cool for the second grade
There is nothing you can do
That I have not already done to myself
Hey![Pre-Chorus]
There is nothing you can do that I have not already done to myself
There is nothing you can do that I have not already done to myself
There is nothing you can do that I have not already done to myself
No, there is nothing you can do that I have not already done to myself
[Chorus]
Never wanted to dance with nobody, not you
(Do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do do-do)
Never wanted to dance with nobody, but you
(Do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do do-do)
Never wanted to dance with nobody
But you wouldn't take no for an answer, you fucking bitch
[Verse]
Be nice, be nice to me
Don't let me be
Be nice, be nice to me
Don't let me go, don't let me go
I'm too cool for the second grade
I'm amazed, I'm afraid
I'm too cool for the second grade
There is nothing you can do
That I have not already done to myself
[Instrumental Break][Chorus]
Never wanted to dance with nobody, but you
Wouldn't take no for an answer, you fucking bitch
Never wanted to dance with nobody, not you
(Do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do do-do)
Never wanted to dance with nobody, but you
(Do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do do-do)
Never wanted to dance with nobody
But you wouldn't take no for an answer, you fucking bitch
