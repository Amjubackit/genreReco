[Intro]
(Even though)
Even though I changed
 (Even though)
Doesn't mean you changed
I was just supposed to change
(Even though)
Even though I changed
 (Even though)
Doesn't mean you changed
You ain't never gonna change
 (Even though)
Ever, ever gonna change
 (Even though)
Look at you
[Verse 1]
So many things are changing
I'm in world that's breaking my heart
No longer feel the same things
So if I fall, just save me from myself
[Pre-Chorus]
Honestly
Honesty
Is the rarest thing alive
I just need your belief
Then I'll be fine
[Chorus]
How do you run before learning to walk?
How to have faith before taking the fall?
Without the night, the sun couldn't show you
Her light, her light
Her light, her light, oh[Interlude]
(Even though)
Even though I changed
 (Even though)
Doesn't mean you changed
You ain't never gonna change
 (Even though)
Ever, ever gonna change
 (Even though)
Look at you
[Verse 2]
There ain't no competition
When you trust intuition, you win
Just close your eyes and listen
Get out the stupid system, somehow
[Pre-Chorus]
Honestly
Honesty
Is the rarest thing alive
I just need your belief
Then I'll be fine
[Chorus]
How do you run before learning to walk?
How to have faith before taking the fall?
Without the night, the sun couldn't show you (Show you)
Her light, her light
How do you run before learning to walk?
How to have faith before taking the fall? (Gotta have faith)
Without the night, the sun couldn't show you (Couldn't show you)
Her light, her light
Her light, her light, oh[Outro]
(
I was just supposed to change
)
Her light, her light (
Even though I changed
)
Her light, her light (
You changed
)
Her light, her light
Her light, her light
Her light, her light
Her light, her light
Her light, her light
