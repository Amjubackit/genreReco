I've been trying to develop an alternative fuel from a mix of all natural substances
But the mix was highly volatile until we found a catalyst
To help stabilize the compound and supercharge the fuel
I'm sorry, what was this magical catalyst?
Marijuana motherfucker
Ladies and gentlemen, players and playettes, teachers, staff, and students
I am very honored to welcome you to the high school annual talent show
Brought to you by the makers of Wiz Khalifa premium rolling papers
And the qualified growers of Snoop Dogg master Kush
So without further a due let's get this show on
First contestant bring your talent to the foreground and let your smoke be the background
[Chorus]
Every time I go out, I'm goin to smoke out
I buy it don't even know the price
As long as I live it, come pay me a visit
And I'll be somewhere up in the sky
My nigga it's 'bout to go down, oh
We fly, it's not lie, that we high, 'til we die, oh
?
Got a joint filled with quality shit
My bottom bitch smokin' with me niggers talk shit, all of 'em shrimp
I'm a big fish, roll a joint lick it once tell you hit this
Rubies on my dick, several cushions on my hit list
In and out these niggas bitches
Smokin' tree and not to mention hustlin' tryna mount my business
You probably went to class while I was in the hallway skipping
Yeah I hear what they sayin', just be too high to listen
Got my money trippin' if I even fold it wrong
You ain't smokin' this good, if it's fire I tell you I sold it all
Or wait 'til one of my hoes come 'round and roll it all
Or say fuck it, and cuff it till I roll with dog
I show up, I show up, I show off
Car push to start, hit the button once it go off
Keep the money comin' in and the papers rolled up
We ain't worried 'bout a hatin' nigga they get no love
