[Intro: SEBASTIAN, spoken]
Okay, okay, listen to me
The human world is a mess
Life under the sea is better than anything they got goin' on up there
[Verse 1: SEBASTIAN]
The seaweed is always greener
In somebody else's lake
You dream about going up there
But that is a big mistake
Just look at the world around you
Right here on the ocean floor
Such wonderful things surround you
What more is you lookin' for?
[Chorus: SEBASTIAN]
Under the sea, under the sea
Darlin', it's better down where it's wettеr
Take it from me
Up on the shorе they work all day
Out in the sun they slave away
While we devotin' full time to floatin'
Under the sea
[Verse 2: SEBASTIAN]
Down here all the fish is happy
As off through the waves they roll
The fish on the land ain't happy
They sad 'cause they in their bowl
But fish in the bowl is lucky
They in for a worser fate
One day when the boss get hungry
Guess who gon' be on the plate?
Oh, no
[Chorus: SEBASTIAN, ARIEL]
Under the sea, under the sea
Nobody beat us, fry us, and eat us in fricassee
We what the land folks love to cook
Under the sea we off the hook
We got no troubles, life is the bubbles
Under the sea (Under the sea)
Hey, under the sea (Under the sea)
Yes, child
Since life is sweet here
We got the beat here naturally (Naturally)
Even the sturgeon an' the ray
They get the urge an' start to play
We got the spirit, you got to hear it
Under the sea
[Bridge: SEBASTIAN]
Watch this
The newt play the flute
The carp play the harp
The plaice play the bass
And they soundin' sharp
The bass play the brass
The chub play the tub
The fluke is the duke of soul, yeah
The ray he can play
The ling's on the strings
The trout rockin' out
The blackfish, she sings
The smelt and the sprat
They know where it's at
An', oh, that blowfish blow
[Chorus: SEBASTIAN, ARIEL, BOTH]
Yeah, under the sea (Under the sea)
Under the sea (Under the sea)
When the sardine begin the beguine
It's music to me (Music is to me)
What do they got?
A lot of sand?
We got a hot crustacean band, ha
Each little clam here
Know how to jam here
Under the sea
[Post-Chorus: SEBASTIAN]
Each little slug here
Cuttin' a rug here
Under the sea
Each little snail here
Know how to wail here
That's why it's hotter
Under the water
Ya, we in luck here
Down in the muck here
Under the sea
