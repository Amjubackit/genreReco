[Verse]
Who the hell said any of you get a taste?
Stupid
Do you ever wanna get up all in your face?
You better take it
And nothing you can do could ever make me go away
Fake it
Poor baby I'm gonna make it all okay
[Chorus]
Punch your lights out
Hit the pavement
That's what I call entertainment
Causing problems makes you famous
All the violence makes a statement
Punch your lights out
Hit the pavement
That's what I call entertainment
Causing problems makes you famous
All this violence makes a statement
She better get with the club
[Verse]
Who the hell said any of you get a taste?
Stupid
Do you ever wanna get up all in your face?
You better take it
And nothing you can do could make me ever go away
Fake it
Poor baby I'm gonna make it all okay[Chorus]
Punch your lights out
Hit the pavement
That's what I call entertainment
Causing problems makes you famous
All the violence makes a statement
Punch your lights out
Hit the pavement
That's what I call entertainment
Causing problems makes you famous
All this violence makes a statement
(Doo doo-doo doo)
(Doo doo-doo doo)
All this violence makes a statement
Punch your lights out
That's what I call entertainment
Punch your lights out
[Chorus]
Punch your lights out
Hit the pavement
That's what I call entertainment
Causing problems makes you famous
All the violence makes a statement
Punch your lights out
Hit the pavement
That's what I call entertainment
Causing problems makes you famous
All this violence makes a statement[Chorus]
Punch your lights out
Hit the pavement
That's what I call entertainment
Causing problems makes you famous
All the violence makes a statement
Punch your lights out
Hit the pavement
That's what I call entertainment
Causing problems makes you famous
All this violence makes a statement
(Doo doo-doo doo)
(Doo doo-doo doo)
All this violence makes a statement
