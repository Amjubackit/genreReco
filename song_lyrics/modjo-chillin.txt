[Verse 1]
One night in a disco
Chillin' with my friends
Feelin' kind of low
I was sitting on a fence
Suddenly I saw her
Dancing on the scene
Just like in a dream
She would set my heart on fire
[Chorus]
I feel so high
Dancing all night
You blow my mind
'Cause you're so fine
[Verse 2]
She had such a swing
Anyone could see
Her body meaning things
That look so good to me
Music got my head
Spinning all around
She got me in a trance
Just by the way she danced
[Chorus]
I feel so high
Dancing all night
You blow my mind
'Cause you're so fine
I feel so high
Dancing all night
You blow my mind
'Cause you're so fine
[Chorus with Verse 2]
I feel so high
Dancing all night
You blow my mind
'Cause you're so fine
I feel so high
She had such a swing
Dancing all night
Anyone could see
You blow my mind
Her body meaning things
'Cause you're so fine
That look so good to me
I feel so high
Music got my head
Dancing all night
Spinning all around
You blow my mind
She got me in a trance
'Cause you're so fine
Just by the way she danced
I feel so high
Music got my head
Dancing all night
Spinning all around
You blow my mind
She got me in a trance
'Cause you're so fine
Just by the way she danced
I feel so high
Music got my head
Dancing all night
Spinning all around
You blow my mind
She got me in a trance
'Cause you're so fine
Just by the way she danced
