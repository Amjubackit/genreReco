[Verse 1]
Face away
Deal with the pain
Your own way
How could they deal with the pain?
[Pre-Chorus]
I knew
It was mine too
And you?
Is it really you?
[Chorus]
Let's search the sky for a while
You and I
Collide like two stars for a while
You and I
[Verse 2]
Crushed by silent snow
Not the first, I know
Caught in ebb and flow
I’m bleeding out, oh, you know
[Chorus]
Let's search the sky for a while
You and I
Collide like two stars for a while
You and I
