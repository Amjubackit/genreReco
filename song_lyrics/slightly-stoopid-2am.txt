[Verse 1]
2 in the morning, police knockin' at my door, what for?
Never know the reasons them be coming packin'
And then they coming through
While telling me just get on my floor
Even though I'm on the floor with a gun to my head
All the reason that I'm holdin' all the trees
And I got a lot a weed
They be spottin' me with infa-red
Saying them rude, and them, "who the hell is you?"
Still they comin' through, holdin' up the innocent
, yeah
[Verse 2]
3 in the mornin', in the cell, you get harassed by the man
Call my girl, baby coming just as quick as she can
With the money for the case, we gonna make it alright
Even though my weed and money could afford it tonight
And leave the case to detonate inside the place when I'm gone
Tellin' all the police inside to go to hell and "so long"
I says I'm rude, singin' "who the hell is you?"
Oh, you coming through, holdin' up them innocent, yeah
[Verse 3]
4 in the mornin', police knockin' at my door, what for?
Bet I know the reasons him be comin' packin'
And then they comin through
While telling me just get on my floor
Even though I'm on my floor with their gun to my head
You know the reason that I'm holdin' all the trees
And I got a lot a weed
They be spottin' me with infa-red
In the mood singing, "who the hell is you?"
Oh, you comin' through, holdin' up the innocent, yeah
