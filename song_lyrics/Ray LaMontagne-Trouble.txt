[Verse 1]
Trouble
Trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble
Trouble been dogging my soul since the day I was born
Worry
Worry, worry, worry, worry
Worry just will not seem to leave my mind alone
[Chorus]
Well, I've been
Saved by a woman
I've been
Saved by a woman
I've been
Saved by a woman
She won't let me go
She won't let me go, no
She won't let me go, no, no...
[Verse 1]
Trouble
Oh, trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble
Feels like every time I get back on my feet she come around and knock me down again
Worry
Oh, worry, worry, worry, worry
Sometimes I swear it feels like this worry
Is my only friend
