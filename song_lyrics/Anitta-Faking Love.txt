[Verse 1: Anitta]
You tell me you're leaving today
You're packing your bags up for good
I'm not gonna stand in your way
Baby, I'd cry if I could, but
[Chorus: Anitta]
I keep faking love
I keep faking love with you
I been faking love
I been faking love, it's true
Now we breaking up
Now we breaking up, boo-hoo
But I been faking love
I been faking love with you
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Verse 2: Saweetie]
Boy, bye
Thought I was a fool, nice try
Need a invoice for my time
You done killed my vibe
Thinkin' I'm a ride or die
Matter a fact, click-clack, bye
They know why, ain't no one surprised I'm in these streets
Let me live my life, throw a party when you leave, leave, leav–µ
