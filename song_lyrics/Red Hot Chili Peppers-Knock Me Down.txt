[Verse 1: John Frusciante & Anthony Kiedis]
Never too soon to be through
Bein' cool too much, too soon
Too much for me, too much for you
You're gonna lose in time
Don't be afraid to show your friends
That you hurt inside, inside
Pain's part of life,
 
don't hide behind your false pride
It's a lie, your lie
[Chorus: John Frusciante, Anthony Kiedis, & 
Vicki Calhoun
]
If you see me gettin' mighty, if you see me gettin' high
Knock me down
I'm not bigger than life
If you see me gettin' mighty, if you see me gettin' high 
(Ooh)
Knock me down 
(Knock me down)
I'm not bigger than life
[Verse 2: John Frusciante & Anthony Kiedis]
I'm tired of bein' untouchable
I'm not above the love
I'm part of you, and you're part of me
Why did you go away?
Findin' what you're lookin' for can end up bein'
Bein' such a bore
I pray for you, most every day, my love's with you
Now fly away
