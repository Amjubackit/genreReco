[Verse 1]
Becky was a beauty from south Alabama
Her daddy had a heart like a nine-pound hammer
Think he even did a little time in the slammer
What was I thinking?
She snuck out one night and met me by the front gate
Her daddy came out waving that twelve gauge
We tore out the drive he peppered my tailgate
What was I thinking?
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I knew there'd be hell to pay
But that crossed my mind a little too late
Cause I was
[Chorus]
Thinking about a little white tank top sitting right
There in the middle by me
I was thinking about a long kiss man just got to get
Going where the night might lead
I know what I was feeling
But what was I thinking... what was I thinking
[Verse 2]
By the county line the cops were nipping on our heels
Pulled off the road and kicked it in four-wheel
Shut off the lights and tore through the corn field
What was I thinking?
Out the other side she was hollering faster
Took a dirt road and had the radio blasting
Hit the honky tonk for a little close dancing
What was I thinking?
