[Chorus: Gabriel Garzón Montano]
Rock me real slowly
Put a bib on me
I'm just like a baby, droolin' over you

[Verse 1: Drake]
These days, I'm lettin' God handle all things above me
The things I can't change are the reason you love me

I'm not ashamed at all
Still findin' myself, let alone a soulmate, I'm just sayin'

Whenever they say somethin' 'bout us, you listen
But fuck what they talkin' about on your timeline
That's cuttin' all into my time with you
Fuck what they talkin' about on your timeline
That's cuttin' all into my time with you
My time with you, my
[Chorus: Gabriel Garzón Montano]
Rock me real slowly
Put a bib on me
I'm just like a baby, droolin' over you
The things you do
