When we were youngin's
We used to play all day
Lord and when the night came
Oh, them lights would dance away
Oh so good, so warm, it felt to play
Like being in your mama's arms, so safe
Where did all the fireflies go
?
Hold your breath
No more movement in the night
Where did all the fireflies go?
I heard someone say
They ain't never coming back
Running wild, feeling oh so free
Trying to light the night up
With the fire inside of me
Oh them lights Lord, they let me be me
Where did all the fireflies go
Where did they go?
Where did all the fireflies go?
Hold your breath
No more movement in the night
Where did all the fireflies go?
I heard someone say
They ain't never coming back
