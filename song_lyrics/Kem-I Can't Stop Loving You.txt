[Verse 1]
I think about the day I met
The perfect stranger
I think about us
And I think about the day I got a-wrapped
Around your finger
I think about us
[Pre-Chorus 1]
The sun was shinin' on you
The Lord was smilin' on me
And love was callin' us
I had my mind made up
[Chorus 1]
And I can't stop lovin' you
I can't help myself
And I can't get over you
No matter what I tell myself, baby
[Verse 2]
Never thought I'd ever love any one else
In my weakness
I think about us
And I think about the day you left
Without speakin'
I think about us
I think about the love we had
For our children
I think about us
I think about the way we laughed
Without a reason
I think about us, girl, ooh, yay
