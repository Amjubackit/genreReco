[Intro]
Why are you never real?
Whenever you appear
You leave me with that grace
I am trembling with fear
But I know that you will disappear
Just as I awake
Whisper in my ear
[Chorus]
Well, I believe
Somewhere in the past
Something was between
You and I, my dear
And it remains
With me to this day
No matter what I do
This scar will never fade
[Refrain]
So let's make trouble in the dream world
Hijack Heaven with another memory now
I make the most of the turning tide
It just split what's left of the burning silence
Don't wait, 'cause this could be the last time
You turn up in the reveries of my mind
I wake up to a suicide frenzy
Loaded dreams still leave me empty
