[Verse 1]
Deep inside your soul there's a hole you don't want to see
Every single day what you say makes no sense to me
Even though I try, I can't get my head around you
[Verse 2]
Somewhere in the night there's a light in front of me
Heaven up above with a shove, I beg it's me
Even though I try, I fall in the river of you
You've managed to bring me down, too
[Chorus 1]
All your fakin'
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Shows you're achin'
Get up, get up, get up
[Verse 3]
Every single day what you say makes no sense to me
Lettin' you inside isn't right, don't mess with me
I never really know what's really going on inside you
I can't get my head around you
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus 2]
All your feedin'
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Shows you're bleedin'
Get up, get up, get up
