[Intro (Japanese)]
Jā, iku zo
Jan, ken, pon!
[Verse 1]
They tell me keep it simple, I tell them take it slow
I feed and water an idea so I let it grow
I tell them take it easy, they laugh and tell me "no"
It's cool, but I don't see them laughin' at my money though
They spittin' facts at me, I’m spittin' tracks, catch me?
I'm spinning gold out my records, know you can’t combat me
They tell me Jesus walks, I tell them money talks
Bling got me chill, 'cause I'm living in an ice box
They tell me I've been sleepin', I say I'm wide awake
Tracks hot and ready, so they call me Mister Easy-Bake
They say the grass is greener,
 
I think my grass is dank
Drivin' with a drank on an empty tank to the bank
[Pre-Chorus]
Do you feel me? Take a look inside my brain
The people always different but it always feels the same
That's the real me, pop the champagne
The haters wanna hurt me, and I'm laughin' at the pain
[Chorus]
Stayin' still, eyes closed
Let the world just pass me by
Pain pills, nice clothes
If I fall, I think I'll fly
Touch me, Midas
Make me part of your design
None to guide us
I feel fear for the very last time
