[Verse 1: Luke Smallbone]
She was holdin' on so tight
But why did we still have to say goodbye?
She's all alone tonight
There's nothin' I can do to make it right
[Pre-Chorus: Luke Smallbone]
Is it ever gonna be, ever gonna be brighter?
Is it ever gonna be, ever gonna be easier?
[Chorus: Luke & Joel Smallbone]
Hold her tonight
Oh God, would You hold her tonight?
'Cause I'm not there to stay close, keep watch
Tell her she's not alone
Hold her tonight
[Verse 2: Joel Smallbone, 
Joel & Luke Smallbone
]
We're apart but not alone
My love for her is more than she could know
A secret place only we can go
 (Only we can go)
And we'll laugh while we will hope until we're home
[Pre-Chorus: Joel & Luke Smallbone]
Is it ever gonna be, ever gonna be brighter?
Is it ever gonna be, ever gonna be easier?[Chorus: Luke & Joel Smallbone]
Hold her tonight
Oh God, would You hold her tonight?
'Cause I'm not there to stay close, keep watch
Tell her she's not alone
Hold her tonight
[Bridge: Joel Smallbone, 
Luke Smallbone
 & 
Both

Steady on, steady on, my love
This shall soon pass
Steady on, steady on, my love
This shall soon pass
Steady on, steady on, my love
This shall soon pass
Steady on, steady on, my love
[Chorus: Luke & Joel Smallbone]
Hold her tonight
Oh God, would You hold her tonight?
'Cause I'm not there to stay close, keep watch
Tell her again she's not alone
Hold her tonight
Hold her tonight
Oh God, would You hold her tonight?
'Cause I'm not there to stay close, keep watch
Tell her she's not alone
Stay close, keep watch
Tell her she's not alone
Hold her tonight
