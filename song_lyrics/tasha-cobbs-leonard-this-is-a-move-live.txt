[Verse 1]
So the song says that…
Mountains are still being moved
Strongholds are still being loosed
God, we believe; 'cause yes, we can see it
That wonders are still what You do
[Verse 2]
I love this one y'all, it says…
And bodies are still being raised, wooh
Giants are still being slain
God, we believe; yes, we can see it
That wonders are still what You do
[Chorus]
We are here for You
Come and do what You do
Say it
We are here for You
Come and do what You do, wooh
We set our hearts on You
Come and do what You do
'Cause we need a move, wooh
We need a move
Can you shout that out? We need a move
We need a move, yeah
We need a move[Verse 2]
And bodies are still being raised, hey!
Giants are still being slain, oh!
God, we believe it, and yes, we can see it, say it
That wonders are still what You do
[Chorus]
We are here for You, ohh, oh-oh-ohh
We are here for You
Come and do it, Lord
Oh do it, Lord
Come and do what You do
We are here for You
We are here for You
You're the only thing that matters
You're the only one that matters
Come and do what You do
We set our hearts on You, ohh, oh-oh-ohh
We set our hearts on You
Come and do what You do
Come and do what You do
Oh do it, Lord
Oh, we need You, to move, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-ohh
