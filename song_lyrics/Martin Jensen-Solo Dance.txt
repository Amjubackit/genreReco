[Verse 1]
In the faded light you touch my body
I can feel your hands on my skin
Think you got me right where you want me
But you're just in my way
[Pre-Chorus]
I came to party on my own
Don't need nobody in my zone
I get down to the beat, I lose control
Eh-oh, I go so-, solo
[Chorus]
Boy, you can cool it down
Not here to fool around
Just wanna dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance
I know you want me
But I don't care, baby
Just wanna dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance
[Post-Chorus]
(Dance, dance, dance)
Dance, dance, dance
(Dance, dance, dance)
