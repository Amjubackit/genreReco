[Skit: Shawn "Clown" Crahan]
How 'bout this one?
De-da-dat, de-da-dat, de-da-dat-dat-dat
De-da-dat, de-da-dat, de-da-dat-dat-dat
[Intro]
Yeah
Yeah
Rise
Half-alive and stark-raving free and maligned
For encroaching on the purpose of this commercial-free interruption
Due to the prolific nature of this statement
Listener aggression is advised
[Verse 1]
It's strange, whenever I see a gun, I think about just how petty you are
And it blows my fucking mind, yeah it blows my fucking mind
These days, I never seem to get enough, I'm tired of this shit, I wanna go home
Don't waste my fucking time, don't waste my fucking time
Because anything exceptional gets crushed by common people
With jealousy and ignorance and all their common evils
This planet isn't special, collections made of clay
I'm waiting for the punishment, I know it's on my way
[Chorus]
Cut, cut, cut me up and fuck, fuck, fuck me up
Cut, cut, cut me up and fuck, fuck, fuck me up
Cut, cut, cut me up and fuck, fuck, fuck me up
Cut, cut, cut me up and fuck, fuck, fuck me up
Cut, cut, cut me up and fuck, fuck, fuck me up
Cut, cut, cut me up and fuck, fuck, fuck me up
