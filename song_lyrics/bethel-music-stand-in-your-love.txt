[Verse 1]
When darkness tries to roll over my bones
When sorrow comes to steal the joy I own
When brokenness and pain is all I know
I won't be shaken, no, I won't be shaken
[Chorus]
My fear doesn't stand a chance when I stand in Your love
My fear doesn't stand a chance when I stand in Your love
My fear doesn't stand a chance when I stand in Your love
[Verse 2]
Shame no longer has a place to hide
I am not a captive to the lies
I'm not afraid to leave my past behind
I won't be shaken, I won't be shaken
[Chorus]
My fear doesn't stand a chance when I stand in Your love
My fear doesn't stand a chance when I stand in Your love
My fear doesn't stand a chance when I stand in Your love
[Bridge]
There's power that can break off every chain
There's power that can empty out a grave
There's resurrection power that can save
There's power in Your name, power in Your name
[Chorus]
My fear doesn't stand a chance when I stand—
My fear doesn't stand a chance when I stand—
My fear doesn't stand a chance when I stand in Your love
No, my fear doesn't stand a chance when I stand in Your love
My fear doesn't stand a chance when I stand in Your love
My fear doesn't stand a chance when I stand in Your love
[Outro]
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, standing on the rock
Standing in Your love
