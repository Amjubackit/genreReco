[Verse 1]
I'm floating down a river
Oars freed from their holes long ago
Lying face up on the floor of my vessel
I marvel at the stars and feel my heart overflow
[Chorus]
Further down the river
Further down the river
Further down the river
Further down the river
[Verse 2]
Two weeks without my lover
I'm in this boat alone
Floating down a river named emotion
Will I make it back to shore or drift into the unknown
[Chorus]
Further down the river
Further down the river
Further down the river
Further down the river
[Verse 3]
I'm building an antenna
Transmissions will be sent when I am through
Maybe we could meet again further down the river
And share what we both discovered then revel in the view[Chorus]
Further down the river
Further down the river
Further down the river
Further down the river
[Outro]
I'm floating down a river
I'm floating down a river
I'm floating down a river
I'm floating down a river
I'm floating down a river
I'm floating down a river
I'm floating down a river
I'm floating down a river
