[Chorus]
I think we could do it if we tried
If only to say you're mine
Sofia, know that you and I
Shouldn't feel like a crime
I think we could do it if we tried
If only to say you're mine
Sofia, know that you and I
Shouldn't feel like a crime
[Verse 1]
You know I'll do anything you ask me to
But, oh my God, I think I'm in love with you
Standing here alone now
Think that we can drive around
I just wanna say
How I love you with your hair down
Baby, you don't gotta fight
I'll be here 'til the end of time
Wishing that you were mine
Pull you in, it's alright
[Chorus]
I think we could do it if we tried
If only to say you're mine
Sofia, know that you and I
Shouldn't feel like a crime
