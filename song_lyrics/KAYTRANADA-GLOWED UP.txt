[Verse 1: Anderson .Paak]
And it still ain't a goddamn thing they could tell me
What could compel me to jump in?
Get a piece of this bread pudding, wake up, cake up
Walking in the form of my elders, I'm glowed up, glowed up
Bitch, don't I look like a pharaoh?
Fuck a story-tale, nigga, pull up
Shit and piss on your head, nigga, clock in
Grab my check out the mail room then back in
Pop up, Daddy Warbucks
Like Warhol with an eightball and a paintbrush
I'm AWOL, I'm AWOL but I ain't done
[Chorus: Anderson. Paak]
Full time killin', bad hoe driller
Chowder for the kitten, Mello Yello lemon
I'm glowed up
I'm glowed up
Yeah, same time stealin', 
same squad chillin'
Baggie full of piff, can't you see I'm livin'?
I'm glowed up
I'm glowed up
Goddamn, I'm glowed up
[Verse 2: Anderson .Paak]
You see me shinin', nigga? That silver linin' nickel plated
Refinery, never sweatin' the minor
And word to the most honorable, no bullshit in 
mi casa
Laxatives in your chowder
Wait, that's the shit I can't condone
Full power until we reach the maximum
Gone are all my worries, I'm looney, absolutely out my dome
Stackin' my capital
, while carving my legacy
Now tell me, is you with me, with me, with me? Chaperone
