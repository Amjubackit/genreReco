[Intro]
Where are we?
What the hell is going on?
The dust has only just begun to fall
Crop circles in the carpet, sinking, feeling
[Chorus]
Mm, whatcha say?
Mm, that you only meant well?
Well, of course you did
Mm, whatcha say?
Mm, that it's all for the best?
Of course it is
Mm, whatcha say?
Mm, that you only meant well?
Well, of course you did
Mm, whatcha say?
Mm, that it's all for the best?
Of course it is
Mm, whatcha say?
Mm, that it's just what we need
And you decided this?
Whatcha say?
Mm, what did she say?
[Chorus]
Mm, whatcha say?
Mm, that you only meant well?
Well, of course you did
Mm, whatcha say?
Mm, that it's all for the best?
Of course it is
Mm, whatcha say?
Mm, that it's just what we need
And you decided this?
Whatcha say?
Mm, what did she say?
[Chorus]
Mm, whatcha say?
Mm, that you only meant well?
Wеll, of course you did
Mm, whatcha say?
Mm, that it's all for the best?
Of coursе it is
Mm, whatcha say?
Mm, that you only meant well?
Well, of course you did
Mm, whatcha say?
Mm, that it's all for the best?
Of course it is
[Outro]
Mm, whatcha say?
Mm, that it's just what we need
And you decided this?
Whatcha say?
Mm, what did she say?
