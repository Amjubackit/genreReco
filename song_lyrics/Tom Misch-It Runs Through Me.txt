[Intro: Tom Misch]
1, 2, 3, 4
[Verse 1: Tom Misch]
I love the way it flows
I love the way it grows
There’s something in this sound that takes me far
It’s like a special song
Can move my mood along
But I cannot say you’ll hear through my guitar
[Pre-Chorus 1: Tom Misch]
She told me add a bassline
And everything will be alright
She told me that the groove is mine
It will take us through the night
And where I’ll go
Can’t explain I’ll never know
But it’s beautiful
[Chorus: Tom Misch]
You can’t take this away from me
The way I hear the melody
The waves bring clarity
Running through me
You can’t take this away from me
The way I hear the melody
The waves bring clarity
Running through me
