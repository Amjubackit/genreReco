[Intro]
Hey! Where's the drums?
Woo, oh, oh, oh
Let's go!
[Verse 1: Tony Oller]
Ooh, girl, you're shining like a 5th Avenue diamond
And they don't make you like they used to
You're never going out of style
Ooh, pretty baby, this world might have gone crazy
The way you saved me, who could blame me?
When I just wanna make you smile?
[Pre-Chorus: Tony Oller]
I wanna thrill you like Michael
I wanna kiss you like Prince
Let's get it on like Marvin Gaye
, 
like Hathaway
Write a song for you like this
[Chorus: Tony Oller, 
Malcolm Kelly
]
You're 
over my head
, I'm out of my mind
Thinking I was born in the wrong time
One of a kind, living in a world gone plastic
Baby, you're so classic (
Yeah, yeah, so classic
)
Baby, you're so classic (
Yeah
, baby you)
Baby, you're so classic
