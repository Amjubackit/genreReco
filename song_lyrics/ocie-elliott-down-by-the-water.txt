Waking in odd spaces, knowing now
That I’m not alone and you are around
And I have 49 places all lined up
While I’m stumbling ‘round with a spilling cup, singing
Facing another way, where I am knowing that the love can stay
And we’re out, down by the water singing our songs
My darling the loving sun’s going down
Cuffed up in my ways and I know you
But I know myself like I know you too
And I see a lot of faces just like ours
And they’re going fast in their speeding cars, rollin’
Facing another way, where I am knowing that the love can stay
And we’re out, down by the water singing our songs
My darling the loving sun’s going down
Oh, on we go
Oh, fast and slow
Facing another way, where I am knowing that the love can stay
And we’re out, down by the water singing our songs
My darling the loving sun’s coming
Take my hand, I don’t need any fear
All I need’s this love and to have you here and tonight
Down by the water emptying cups
My darling, the loving sun’s coming up
