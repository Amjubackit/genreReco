[Verse 1]
Walked around like I was missing, 'cause I was missing You
I was looking for a reason, but couldn't find the truth
Never knew it could be different, then I ran into You
You make falling feel like flying, I'm tripping into You
[Pre-Chorus]
Even when I was broken and hopeless
You walked in and things changed
I realize, You're all that I want
[Chorus]
You say the word and I'll follow (I'll follow)
I won't let anything get in the way
Nothing, no, nothing can stop me (Stop me)
'Cause I'm better, better with You
You say the word and I'll follow (I'll follow)
I won't let anything get in the way
Nothing, no, nothing can stop me (Stop me)
'Cause I'm better, better with You
[Verse 2]
Now I'm seeing all the colors, You opened up my eyes
You did it in a moment, my darkness into light
[Pre-Chorus]
You give me purpose, I'm chosen
Without You, I'm nothing
I realize, You're all that I want[Chorus]
You say the word and I'll follow (I'll follow)
I won't let anything get in the way
Nothing, no, nothing can stop me (Stop me)
'Cause I'm better, better with You
You say the word and I'll follow (I'll follow)
I won't let anything get in the way
Nothing, no, nothing can stop me (Stop me)
'Cause I'm better, better with You
[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh
'Cause I'm better, better with You
Oh, oh, oh
'Cause I'm better, better with You
[Interlude]
You say the word and I'll follow
I won't let anything get in the way
Nothing, no, nothing can stop me
You say the word and I'll follow
I won't let anything get in the way
Nothing, no, nothing can stop me
[Outro]
Oh, oh
'Cause I'm better, better with You
Oh
'Cause I'm better, better with You
Oh
