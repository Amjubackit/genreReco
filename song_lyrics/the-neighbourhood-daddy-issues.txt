[Verse 1]
Take you like a drug
I taste you on my tongue
[Pre-Chorus]
You ask me what I'm thinking about
I tell you that I'm thinking about
Whatever you're thinking about (Ah)
Tell me somethin' then I'll forget
And you might have to tell me again
It's crazy what you do for a friend
[Chorus]
Go ahead and cry, little girl
Nobody does it like you do
I know how much it matters to you
I know that you got daddy issues
And if you were my little girl
I'd do whatever I could do
I'd run away and hide with you
I know that you got daddy issues, and I do too
[Verse 2]
I tried to write your name in the rain
But the rain never came
So I made with the sun
The shade
Always comes at the worst times (Ah)
