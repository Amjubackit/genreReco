[Verse 1]
Choke, tried to wash you down with something strong
Tried, but the taste of blood remains (Taste of blood remains)
Cold, empty mattresses and falling stars
My, how they start to look the same
[Chorus]
So keep in happiness and torture me
While I tell you "Let's go in style"
A million hooks around, a million ways to die
Darling, it's cold outside
[Verse 2]
No, no more eyes to see the sun (To see the sun)
You slide into bed while I get drunk
Slow conversations with a gun mean more
Than I've ever said to anyone, anyone
[Chorus]
So keep in happiness and torture me
While I tell you "Let's go in style”
A million hooks around, a million ways to die
Darling, let’s go inside, it'll be alright
[Bridge]
But last night
You said you ended up in Palm Springs dancing on tables
Almost fought some bitch at the club (Yeah!)
Got kicked out of your hotel and lost your shoes
Well, fuck, what, am I supposed to be impressed?
You're just another set of bones to lay to rest
I guess it's time to say goodnight
Hope you had a really good time
Good time
[Pre-Chorus]
But I will soon forget the color of your eyes
And you'll forget mine
[Chorus]
So keep in happiness and torture me
While I tell you "Let's go in style"
A million hooks around, amillion ways to die
Let’s go outside, it’ll be alright
[Outro]
But last night
You said you ended up in Palm Springs dancing on tables
