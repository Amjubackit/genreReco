[Chorus]
I can never do enough
They're always askin' for too much
I need to get some better luck
Need a moment to adjust
Too many faces I don't trust
There's no sense in yelling man down
No one can hear me they ain't comin' around
Up to my neck but I ain't gonna drown
Been here so long I had to double down (Down)
[Bridge 1]
I ain't gonna change
It was what it is
I ain't shakin' hands
Fuck makin' amends
I’m breakin' your chin
I came here to win
I’m killin' you sharks
I’m cuttin' your fins
I’m breakin' the silence
I'll stay with a grin
You're stayin' behind me
Fuck outta my lense
I came with a smile
I cannot forget
I'm way past a line
See I don't forgive[Verse 1]
I got an appetite for destruction
I’m on a warpath and I’m gunnin'
Bitch you can see me from a fuckin' mile away
I ain’t scared even though I'm commin'
All this struggle shit ain't new to me
Half a million on these lawyer fees
Seven years bitch still on my feet
Let's go to the toe
Let's see who bleeds
(Hey)
Only option is to run it
Don't  step in unless you want it
I'm the ghost that keeps on hauntin'
No one come close I see you stumblin'
Give no slack I see you crumblin'
Don't relax I see you fumblin'
Off your head you know I’m huntin'
Paint it red I’ll make it stunnin'
[Pre-Chorus]
You have no reason while I got a hundred
You don't believe me so I’m gonna sign it
And you think that I'm rich
Well I see you lounging
It's like you don't mean shit
And you're just a puppet
See I got nothin' but still makin' something
Never a minute that I am not wondering
But in the end I know[Chorus]
I can never do enough
They're always askin' for too much
I need to get some better luck
Need a moment to adjust
So many faces I don't trust
There's no sense in yelling man down
No one can hear me they ain't comin' around
Up to my neck but I ain't gonna drown
Been here so long I had to double down (Down)
[Bridge 2]
So please don't provoke me
Let no one control me
There’s no one above me
Like no one before me
I’m breakin' your system
I’m risin' above
And I’m makin' it work
Ain’t worry about judgement
I’m turnin' the milk into butter
And crawl out the bucket
I'm makin' no music inspired of puppets
I'm learnin' at times I gotta say fuck it
I'm gettin' so close but never can touch it[Verse 2]
Awaken a beast and I don't agree I'll catch you asleep (yeah)
Fuck makin' peace I'll take you at ease I’m takin' your seat (Yeah)
You wanna a bridge so I took a leap
You’re just a bitch you’re just a siege
I’m givin’ you pain I’m snatchin' your grief
You're fadin' away I’m takin' the lead
No one will follow you into battle
No one sees you just a shadow
While you lookin' like you rattled
I’ve been runnin' with the jackals
Break you down I’ll make examples
See you lookin' like you’re fragile
Out here talkin' all that babble
Tear you down I will dismantle
[Pre-Chorus]
You have no reason while I got a hundred
You don't believe me so I’m gonna sign it
And you think that I'm rich
Well I see you lunging
It's like you don't mean shit
And you're just a puppet
See I got nothin' but I’m still makin' something
Never a minute that I am not wondering
But in the end I know
[Chorus]
I can never do enough
They're always askin' for too much
I need to get some better luck
Need a moment to adjust
So many faces I don't trust
There's no sense in yelling man down
No one can hear me they ain't comin' around
Up to my neck but I ain't gonna drown
Been here so long I had to double down (Down)
[Instrumental]
