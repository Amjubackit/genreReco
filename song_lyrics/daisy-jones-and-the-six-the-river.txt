[Verse 1: Sam Claflin & Riley Keough]
I could've sworn this was the way
Tell me again, why do we stay
On such a lonely, lonely, lonely road?
You'd never guess, I'll never know
But we're on the same side and it's gonna
Be a lonely, lonely, lonely road
[Chorus: Sam Claflin & Riley Keough]
If I follow you to the river
Send my blues out to the sea
Will you stay with me forever?
Will you chase me in my dreams?
If I throw it all in the river
And let the rhythm take the lead
Will it stay with you and never
Let you leave on me?
[Post-Chorus: Sam Claflin & Riley Keough]
Ooh, I know, I know
Ooh, I know
[Verse 2: Sam Claflin & Riley Keough, Sam Claflin]
You had a choice I couldn't make
And this is the last turn that you take
On a lonely, lonely, lonely road
Give me your hand, here is my heart
Where does it end? When do we start?
On a lonely, lonely, lonely road
[Chorus: Sam Claflin & Riley Keough]
If I follow you to the river
Send my blues out to the sea
Will you stay with me forever?
Will you chase me in my dreams?
If I throw it all in the river
And let the rhythm take the lead
Will it stay with you and never
Let you leave on me?
[Post-Chorus: Sam Claflin & Riley Keough]
Ooh, I know, I know
Ooh, I know
[Bridge: Riley Keough]
I'm an echo in your shadow
In your shadow, I'm in too deep
In the river, your reflection
Is a promise you couldn't keep
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I lost you here
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I took you here
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I lost you here
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
This isn't fair
[Break: Sam Claflin & Riley Keough]
Ooh
Ooh-ah
Ooh-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ooh-ah
[Outro: Sam Claflin, Riley Keough]
If I follow you to the river
And if I follow you to the river
(If I follow you to the river)
Oh, the shadows go down so deep
If I follow you to the river (I took you there)
And your shadow
In the river, your reflection
Is a promise you couldn't keep
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I lost you here
If I follow you to the river (Oh)
If I follow you to the river
(Oh, if I follow you to the river)
In the river, your reflection
Is a promise you couldn't keep
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I lost you here
(Oh, if I follow you to the river)
And your shadow
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I lost you here
I know, I know, I know
I love you now
