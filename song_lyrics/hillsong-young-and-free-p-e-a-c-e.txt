[Verse 1]
You will stay true
Even when the lies come
Your word remains truth
Even when my thoughts don't line up
I will stand tall
On each promise You made
Let the rest fade away
[Chorus]
There's a peace far beyond all understanding
May it ever set my heart at ease
Dare anxiety come, I'll remember
That peace is a promise You keep
Peace is a promise You keep
[Verse 2]
You will stay true
Even in the chaos
Your word remains truth
Even when my mind wreaks havoc
I will be still
For I've known all along
My Jehovah Shalom
[Chorus]
There's a peace far beyond all understanding
May it ever set my heart at ease
What anxiety fails to remember
Is peace is a promise You keep
Peace is a promise You keep
[Bridge]
You are peace to a restless soul
Peace when my thoughts wage war
Peace to the anxious heart
That's who You are, that's who You are
You are peace when my fear takes hold
Peace when I feel enclosed
Peace when I lose control
That's who You are, that's who You are
[Chorus]
I've found peace far beyond all understanding
Let it flow when my mind's under siege
All anxiety bows in the presence
Of Jesus the Keeper of Peace
And peace is a promise He keeps
