[Verse 1]
Before I woke up this mornin', I done knew where he went
He hid the keys to my car, smoked my last cigarette
Well, that good-for-nothin’ mothertruckin' son of a gun
I don't need to know her name ’cause I can tell you which one
[Chorus]
He went back to Tulsa
Put some miles on that 
adios Tacoma
And I ain't talkin' Oklahoma
'Cause it ain't what you think
But if you spell it back-to-front, you gonna know what I mean
[Verse 2]
Bet he's thinkin' that I'm cryin’, couldn’t be more wrong
He done got his ass kicked out, he did it all on his own
I took every last bit and threw it out in the grass
He can pick up his shit if hе ever comes back
[Chorus]
Hе went back to Tulsa
Put some miles on that adios Tacoma
And I ain't talkin’ Oklahoma
'Cause it ain't what you think
But if you spell it back-to-front, you gonna know what I mean
He went back to Tulsa[Verse 3]
Hon, you done me a favor and I ain't angry with you
Babe, there’s millions of Tulsas and you'll be singin' this soon
I hate to break it to ya, but you're 'bout to find out
He's a real P.O.S. and he's your problem now
[Chorus]
He went back to Tulsa (Where'd he go?)
Put some miles on that adios Tacoma
You know that I ain't talkin' Oklahoma
'Cause it ain't what you think
But if you spell it back-to-front, you gonna know what I mean
He went back to Tulsa
Put some miles on that adios Tacoma
And I ain't talkin' Oklahoma
'Cause it ain't what you think
But if you spell it back-to-front, you gonna know what I mean
He went back to Tulsa (Woo, woo)
[Outro]
I hope he stays there
