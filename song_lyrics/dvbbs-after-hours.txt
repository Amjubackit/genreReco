[Intro]
You can meet me after hours
[Verse 1]
I'm not gonna lie
I like it when you call me late at night
I get a little rush that I can't deny
I can't deny...
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't get it twisted, I can take care of myself
But you're heading different, you could be bad for my health
And I'll keep it a secret, shouldn't be creepin'
But tonight I'll let it go
[Chorus]
You can meet me after hours
Ain't nobody gotta know, know, know
I'll show you my superpowers
If you'll keep it in the low, low, low
[Verse 2]
I'm not tryna fight
And maybe you can be my kryptonite
I'm never gonna tell you your whole life
Your whole life...
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't get it twistеd, I can take care of myself
But you'rе heading different, you could be bad for my health
And I'll keep it a secret, shouldn't be creepin'
But tonight I'll let it go
[Chorus]
You can meet me after hours
Ain't nobody gotta know, know, know
I'll show you my superpowers
If you'll keep it in the low, low, low
[Outro]
You can meet me after hours
