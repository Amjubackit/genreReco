Why did we have to meet ?
Cause now we barely speak
Life happens
At night I still can't sleep
When you're not next to me
Life happens
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, Oh-oh-oh
When I think back I think of times we did most of
Driving down the PCH, living in the moment
Long summer nights smoking, staring at the ocean
Sitting on an island, where the sunset is golden
I know the universe will give us back what we put in
Heart stay broke, but my mind stay resilient
Remember all those times that you said that we shouldn't ?
Trying to convince me that I had one foot in
But I know you gave me everything that you had
Now you're on the top girl, don't look back
Everything in front, you don't let it distract
Hope you're killing everything that's in your path, yeah
Girl go keep that passion
Everything else burn to ashes
This life won't come, go and take it
But...
Why did we have to meet ?
Cause now we barely speak
Life happens
At night I still can't sleep
When you're not next to me
Life happens
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, Oh-oh-oh
The love stright burned me like a bullet, yeah
It went straight through me, but it couldn't pull me down
Feeling fucking empty really stressed me out
Still learned how to make every day count
All these mixed emotions that I can't dismiss
Have to relearn to go resist
When I hear ya laugh got to see your grin
Fuck, why does everything started got to end
But...
Life only favors the bold
That's why I never blinked when you said you wanna go
Always knew there would be a time when you had to leave home
New beginnings only come when another chapter closes
Girl don't lose that focus
Everything you do, go own it
This life ain't always roses
But...
Why did we have to meet?
Cause now we barely speak
Life happens
At night I still can't sleep
When you're not next to me
Life happens
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, Oh-oh-oh
