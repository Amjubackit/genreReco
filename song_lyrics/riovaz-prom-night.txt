[Chorus]
Woke up, got down, now I'm feeling like death
I can't listen to a word you just said
Broken hearts all on me, they're stuck in my chest
And it's all for you
Woke up, got down, now I'm feeling like death
I can't listen to a word you just said
Broken hearts all on me, they're stuck in my chest
And it's all for you
[Refrain]
And she held my hand, but I am dreaming
She's with another man
, girl, I am lost (Lost)
And I don't understand why you left me like that
I don't understand why you left me like that
[Interlude]
(*Alarm clock buzzing*)
[Chorus]
Woke up, got down, now I'm feeling like death
I can't listen to a word you just said
Broken hearts all on me, they're stuck in my chest
And it's all for you
Woke up, got down, now I'm feeling like death
I can't listen to a word you just said
Broken hearts all on me, they're stuck in my chest
And it's all for you[Refrain]
And she held my hand, but I am dreaming
She's with another man, girl, I am lost (Lost)
And I don't understand why you left me like that
I don't understand why you left me like that
[Outro]
Woke up, got down, now I'm feeling like death
I can't listen to a word you just said
Broken hearts all on me, they're stuck in my chest
And it's all for you
