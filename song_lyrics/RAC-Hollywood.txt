I’m not telling you again what you need
It’s just a slap around
To make everything stop and cure the fall
When you come back down
I’m not everything you want
I’m just a tease
Maybe a matter of touch
You could tell me what you want, I’ll give it to you
Maybe you think to much
Cause you’re Hollywood, you never should
We never talk anymore With your high heels on
You kill the sun, I’m not your friend anymore
I’m so sick and tired of everyone telling you what you want
I could never keep track who’s gonna come
When you start waving your magic wand
And you seem to forget everything that you said
Before you had it written for you
There’s too much going on that you need to belong to
It’s the only thing you know how to do
Cause you’re Hollywood, another world
You made it all on your own
With your high heels on
You kill the sun
, I’m not your friend anymore
