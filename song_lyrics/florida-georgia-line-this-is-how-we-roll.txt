[Verse 1: Florida Georgia Line]
The mixtapes got a little Hank, little Drake
A little somethin' bumpin', thumb thumpin' on the wheel right
The mix in our drinks, a little stronger than you think
So get a grip, take a sip of that feel right
Trucks jacked up
, 
flat bills flipped back
Yeah, you can find us where the party's at
[Chorus: Florida Georgia Line]
This is how we roll, whoa, whoa
We hangin' 'round, singin' down everything on the radio
Whoa, whoa
We light it up 
with our hands up
This is how we roll, 
this is how we do
We're burning down the night, shootin' bullets at the moon, baby
This is how we roll, whoa, whoa
[Verse 2: Florida Georgia Line]
Yeah, baby, this is how we roll
We rollin' into town with nothin' else to do
We take another lap around
Yeah, holla at your boy if you need a ride
If you roll with me, yeah, you know we rollin' high
Up on them 37 Nittos, windows tinted, hard to see though
How fresh my baby is in the shotgun seat oh
Them kisses are for me though, automatic like a free throw
This life I live, it might not be for you, but it's for me though
(Let's roll!)
