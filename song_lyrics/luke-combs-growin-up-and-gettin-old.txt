[Verse 1]
I still hit them dive bars, every once in a blue moon
I've got a wild card, that I keep inside my boot
I've been thinkin' lately maybe I should save it
'Cause them hangovers sure kick my ass these days
So I spend most my happy hours here at home
In the middle of growin' up and gettin' old
[Chorus]
But I can still raise hell all night with the boys when I want to
Lay that hammer down to see how fast she'll go
But these days I hang my hat on what I won't do
I've been findin' peace of mind slowin' my roll
You learn to toe that line with time as it goes
In the middlе of growin' up and gettin' old
[Verse 2]
It's when you start thinkin', how much time lеft you got
If it's more sand, in the bottom or the top
'Cause that hourglass we have don't last forever
I've been thinkin' 'bout it more and more these days
It's like the less you have, the faster that it goes
In the middle of growin' up and gettin' old
[Chorus]
But I can still raise hell all night with the boys when I want to
Lay that hammer down to see how fast she'll go
But these days I hang my hat on what I won't do
I've been findin' peace of mind slowin' my roll
You learn to toe that line with time as it goes
In the middle of growin' up and gettin' old[Bridge]
I'm still bendin' rules but thinkin' 'fore I break 'em
And I ain't lost a step, I just look before I take 'em
[Chorus]
But I can still raise hell all night with the boys when I want to
Lay that hammer down to see how fast she'll go
But these days I hang my hat on what I won't do
And I've been findin' peace of mind slowin' my roll
Learn to toe that line with time as it goes
In the middle of growin' up and gettin' old
