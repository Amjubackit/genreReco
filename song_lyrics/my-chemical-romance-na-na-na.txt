[Intro: Dr. Death Defying]
The future is bulletproof!
The aftermath is secondary
It's time to do it now and do it loud
Killjoys, make some noise!
Na, na na, na, na na na
Na na na, na na na
Na, na na, na, na na na
Na na na, na na na
Na, na na, na, na na
Na, na na na, na na
Na, na na na na
[Verse 1]
Drugs, gimme drugs
Gimme drugs, I don't need it
But I'll sell what you got
Take the cash and I'll keep it
Eight legs to the wall
Hit the gas, (Kill 'em all)
And we crawl, and we crawl, and we crawl
You be my detonator
[Verse 2]
Love, gimme love
Gimme love, I don't need it
But I'll take what I want from your heart
And I'll keep it in a bag, (In a box)
Put an "X" on the floor
Gimme more, gimme more, gimme more
Shut up and sing it with me
