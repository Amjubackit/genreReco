[Verse]
All of your problems
All of your pain
All of your trouble
You can give it to Jesus
All of your burdens
All of your cares
Even your struggles
You can give it to Jesus
[Chorus]
He won't fail
He won't fail
No, He won't leave you
He won't fail
[Bridge]
I've seen it with my own eyes
I've seen it in my own life
He keeps every promise
I'll never be forsaken
He keeps every promise
I'll never be forsaken
[Post-Bridge]
I've seen it with my own eyes
