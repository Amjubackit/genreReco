[Verse 1]
Whoever told you
I don't care about you
Is that a friend
You should keep around you?
I tried my best
To remove all the doubts now
Our business
Is open for discussion
[Chorus]
They think you can do better
All alone
A couple strangers acting clever
Oh no
They come and go it’s temperamental
I told you so I only care about forever
I wish you the best in all your future endeavours
Let's see where this goes and find out if we end up better
[Verse 2]
Had me convinced that I knеw you best
And now you're sending paragraphs of words that camе from someone else
Why’d you have to put me to the test?
The pressure leaves the impression you're wanting something else[Bridge]
(Yeah) And why are all your friends paranoid?
Do they not know how much that we were in love?
Hope you're not stuck with this unfillable void
Gave you my everything and now I'm left with nothing
[Chorus]
Just because they think you can do better
All alone
A couple strangers acting clever
Oh no
They come and go it's temperamental
I told you so I only care about forever
I wish you the best in all your future endeavours
Let's see where this goes and find out if we end up better
