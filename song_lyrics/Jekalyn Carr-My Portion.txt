[Verse 1]
Mm, mm, yeah, yeah, yeah
You never knew
You would fail
You never knew
You'd go through the things you've been through
You never knew
That you would fall
But I heard his voice say
I heard his voice say
[Chorus]
Years of pain
It is not your portion
Failure
It is not your portion
Sickness
It is not your portion
Poverty
It is not your portion
(
I have to embrace the promise
) Ooh, ooh, oh, oh
[Verse 2]
You never knew
You'd be broken
You never knew
You'd cry the tears that you've cried
You never knew
You'd lose the things you've lost
But I heard his voice say
I have good news, I have good news
