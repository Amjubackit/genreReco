[Verse 1]
I was an orphan in my own home
All I felt was isolation, even with someone close
Tossed in a field, left to die
But You walked by me and gave me life
[Pre-Chorus]
You've shown me what love looks like
You've shown me what love looks like
You've shown me what love looks like
You've shown me what love looks like
[Chorus]
Father, I just wanted to thank You
'Cause most of my life I've been running
But the love in Your eyes said that I'm safe here
So I'm not going anywhere
No, I'm not going anywhere
I think I'll stay here with You
[Verse 2]
No place I need to be but here with You
No place I'd rather be but here with You
No place I need to be but here with You
No place i'd rather be but here with You
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause You've shown me what love looks like
You've shown me what love looks like
You've shown me what love looks like
You've shown me what love looks like
[Chorus]
Father, I just wanted to thank You
'Cause most of my life I've been running
But the love in Your eyes said that I'm safe here
So I'm not going anywhere
Father, I just wanted to thank You
'Cause most of my life I've been running
But the love in Your eyes said that I'm safe here
So I'm not going anywhere
No, I'm not going anywhere
I think I'll stay here with You
