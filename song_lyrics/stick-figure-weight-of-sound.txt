[Verse 1: Scott Woodruff]
This one goes out to my girl tonight
I'll sing a song for you because the mood is right
It's 2:16 on a Saturday night
My girl she is passed out, she's not feeling alright
Twenty four hours can be a long time
To be lying in bed from the previous night
I'll sit here and drink myself a beer
All night long, I'll sing this song till you call on me, yeah
Tomorrow will come and the sun will shine
Well I'll be sitting here right by your side
So let the music soothe your soul
Let the music take control
Everything you do or say comes back to you
When things don't work out right, you got to push on through
[Chorus: Scott Woodruff]
So keep on running, keep on moving
Everything is gonna be alright
So keep on smiling, keep on laughing
Every little thing is gonna be alright
[Verse 2: Scott Woodruff]
If you left this choice up to me
Don't tell me what you got girl
Baby please tell me what you need
I must confess, I've been blessed but I'll never say never
'Cause I could die today but this music lives forever
And nothing is impossible, nothing is out of your reach
It's just another love song, just another melody
So keep believing in your dreams, life's not what it seems sometimes
And love the air you breathe, you got everything you need for tonightRunning away, running away
So far from this place, running away
[Chorus: Scott Woodruff]
So keep on running, no... keep on moving, yeah
Everything is gonna be alright
So keep on smiling, no... keep on laughing, yeah
Every little thing is gonna be alright
[Verse 3: TJ O'Neill]
Playing on your radio, coming through your stereo
And everybody's getting down
You can't seem to let it go, running like a video
You're haunted by the weight of sound
In your eyes, you focus on the light
And for tonight, just relax and let's get high
The sun it is a sinking low, I'm thinking that it's time to go
And everybody's headed home
Watch them as they come and go, listen to your soul it knows
Can you feel the weight of sound?
It's just love there's nothing that's more real
This love, and the way it makes you feel
