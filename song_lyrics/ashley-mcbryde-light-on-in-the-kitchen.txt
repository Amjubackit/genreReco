[Verse 1]
Always check the door before you lay down
Keep a glass of water by the bed
A dose of local honey
Will keep your nose from runnin'
Little things like that she's always said
[Pre-Chorus]
Never back up farther than you have to
Pray for those that don't have a prayer
[Chorus]
Honey, trust yourself
You better love yourself
'Cause 'til you do, you ain't no good
For anybody else
And, honey, boys are dumb
But you gonna find your one
Love him hard and bless your heart
You'll need someone to listen
That's why I leave a light on in the kitchen
[Verse 2]
Pancakes just taste better after midnight
When you make friends, always be color blind
Your freckles make you pretty
There's more to life than bein' skinny
When you feel fat, it's mostly in your mind
[Chorus]
So, honey, trust yourself
You better love yourself
'Cause 'til you do, you ain't no good
To anybody else
And, honey, boys are dumb
But you gonna find your one
Love him hard and bless your heart
You'll need someone to listen
And that's why I leave a light on in the kitchen
[Bridge]
(Ooh, ooh)
[Chorus]
Well, honey, trust yourself
Laugh at yourself
If somethin' tries to hold you back
Get up and give it hell
And for heaven's sake
Always have a place
That you can do some cryin' and some bitchin'
And always leave a light on in the kitchen
