[Verse 1: Aodhan King]
Who can melt the hardest heart
And speak life into my soul
Who can spin the world around
And hold me ever close
[Verse 2: Aodhan King]
Who can search the depths of me
And love me to the core
Who controls the world I see
And walks me through it all
[Chorus: Aodhan King]
No one but You
No one but You
[Verse 3: Aodhan King]
Who has made the righteous bright
Who has paved my way with grace
Loved me through my darkest hours
A thousand different ways
[Chorus: Aodhan King]
No one but You
No one but You
[Post-Chorus: Aodhan King]
I'll sing of Your love
I can't get enough
I just want You
The Lord of my soul
King of my heart
Jesus it's You
[Bridge: Aodhan King]
Hear the oceans roar
See the skies light up
Every heart now
Sing to the Lord
Hear the rocks cry out
See the mountains bow
Every heart come
Worship the Lord
Hear the oceans roar
See the skies light up
Every heart now
Sing to the Lord
Hear the rocks cry out
See the mountains bow
Every heart now
Sing to the Lord
Hear the oceans roar
See the skies light up
Every heart now
Sing to the Lord
Hear the rocks cry out
See the mountains bow
Every heart come
Worship the Lord
[Interlude]
[Bridge: Aodhan King]
Hear the oceans roar
See the skies light up
Every heart now
Sing to the Lord
Hear the rocks cry out
See the mountains bow
Every heart come
Worship the Lord
[Bridge 2: Brooke Ligertwood]
