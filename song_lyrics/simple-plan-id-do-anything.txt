[Verse 1]
Another day is going by
I'm thinking about you all the time
But you're out there and I'm here waiting
And I wrote this letter in my head
'Cause so many things were left unsaid
But now you're gone and I can't think straight
[Pre-Chorus]
This could be the one last chance to make you understand, yeah
[Chorus]
I'd do anything
Just to hold you in my arms
To try to make you laugh
'Cause somehow I can't put you in the past
I'd do anything
Just to fall asleep with you
Will you remember me?
'Cause I know I won't forget you
[Verse 2]
Together we broke all the rules
Dreaming of dropping out of school
And leave this place but never come back
So now, maybe after all these years
If you miss me, have no fear
I'll be here, I'll be waiting
[Pre-Chorus]
This could be the one last chance to make you understand
And I just can't let you leave me once again, yeah
[Chorus]
I'd do anything
Just to hold you in my arms
To try to make you laugh
'Cause somehow I can't put you in the past
I'd do anything
Just to fall asleep with you
Will you remember me?
'Cause I know I won't forget you
[Bridge]
I close my eyes
And all I see is you
I close my eyes
I try to sleep, I can't forget you
Na na na, na na na
And I'd do anything for you
Na na na, na na na, na
[Chorus]
I'd do anything
Just to hold you in my arms
To try to make you laugh
'Cause somehow I can't put you in the past
I'd do anything
Just to fall asleep with you
To fall asleep with you
With you, yeah
[Outro]
I'd do anything
To fall asleep with you
I'd do anything
There's nothing I won't do (I'd do anything)
To fall asleep with you (I'd do anything)
'Cause I know I won't forget you
