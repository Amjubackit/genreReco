[Verse 1]
It's crazy how manipulation feels like
A soft blanket holding you tight
And every night sleeping next to someone's
Just as warm as the gaslight
[Verse 2]
It’s funny how jealousy sounds like
Somebody's worried bout you
And all that control
Takes on different roles
Don't realize the toll it takes on you
[Pre-Chorus]
I've been to pretty dark places
Stuck in toxic situations
But you taste like stability
And that's new for me
[Chorus]
Yeah, this feels like homemade cooking like
Backyard kissing like
Hold the door open and I laugh but it's nice like
Sunday, sleepin' in
Baby, I'm leanin' in
Conversations I can tell that you're listening
I thought I knеw what
I knew what love was
Guess I didn't know at all
'Causе I don't know what this is
But I think love's supposed to feel like this
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
