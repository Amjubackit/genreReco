[Verse 1]
I just want to speak the name of Jesus
Over every heart and every mind
'Cause I know there is peace within Your presence
I speak Jesus
[Verse 2]
I just want to speak the name of Jesus
'Til every dark addiction starts to break
Declaring there is hope and there is freedom
I speak Jesus
[Chorus]
'Cause Your name is power
Your name is healing
Your name is life
Break every stronghold
Shine through the shadows
Burn like a fire
[Verse 3]
I just want to speak the name of Jesus
Over fear and all anxiety
To every soul held captive by depression
I speak Jesus[Chorus]
Your name is power
Your name is healing
Your name is life
Break every stronghold
Shine through the shadows
Burn like a fire
[Bridge]
Shout Jesus from the mountains, Jesus in the streets
Jesus in the darkness over every enemy
Jesus for my family
I speak the holy name, Jesus
Shout Jesus from the mountains, Jesus in the streets
Jesus in the darkness over every enemy
Jesus for my family
I speak the holy name, Jesus
Shout Jesus from the mountains and Jesus in the streets
And Jesus in the darkness over every enemy
And Jesus for my family
I speak the holy name, Jesus
[Chorus]
Your name is power
Your name is healing
Your name is life
Break every stronghold
Shine through the shadows
Burn like a fire
Your name is power
Your name is healing
Your name is life
Break every stronghold
Shine through the shadows
Burn like a fire[Verse 4]
I just want to speak the name of Jesus
Over every heart and every mind
'Cause I know there is peace within His presence
I speak Jesus
