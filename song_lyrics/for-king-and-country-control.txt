[Verse 1: Luke Smallbone]
You asked me to let go but I thought I knew better
Afraid of surrender and what I don't know
I've always had a plan, but now I'm so weary
And I can't see clearly, forgot who I am
[Pre-Chorus: Luke Smallbone]
So won't You make my eyes Your eyes?
My ears Your ears, my tears Your tears?
And won't you make my hands Your hands?
My feet Your feet, my dreams Your dreams?
[Chorus: Joel & Luke Smallbone]
I give up control, oh-oh-oh-oh, woah
Body, mind, and soul, oh-oh-oh-oh, woah
Can't do this on my own, alone, no
I give up control
[Verse 2: Luke & Joel Smallbone]
Can I speak honestly? I've still got some questions
Still fightin' attention, I need some relief
No, I'm no Superman, this is my confession
Been learnin' my lesson, help me understand
[Pre-Chorus: Luke & Joel Smallbone]
So won't You make my eyes Your eyes?
My ears Your ears, my tears Your tears?
And won't you make my hands Your hands?
My feet Your feet, my dreams Your dreams?[Chorus: Joel & Luke Smallbone]
I give up control, oh-oh-oh-oh, woah
Body, mind, and soul, oh-oh-oh-oh, woah
Can't do this on my own, alone, no
I give up control

I will raise my voice and sing
I will, I will raise my voice and sing
It is all I've got left to bring
I will, I will raise my voice and sing
I will raise my voice and sing
I will, I will raise my voice and sing, yeah
It is all I've got left to bring
I will, I will raise my voice and sing
I give up control
[Chorus: Luke & Joel Smallbone]
I give up control, oh-oh-oh-oh, woah
Body, mind, and soul, oh-oh-oh-oh, woah
Can't do this on my own, alone, no
I give up control, oh-oh-oh-oh, woah
Body, mind, and soul, oh-oh-oh-oh, woah
I can't do this on my own, alone, no
I give up control[Outro: Joel Smallbone,
