Well I ain't got no money
Ain't got no car
Ain't got no excuses baby
I am hanging out at the bar
I don't owe you a thang baby
I don't owe you a thang
I don't owe you a thang now baby
I don't owe you a thang
But we ain't gettin' married
I ain't buying you no diamond ring
That's alright
Ain't got no credit
No fancy clothe
Ain't got no excuses baby
Oh goodness no
I don't owe you a thang baby
I don't owe you a thang
I don't owe you a thang now baby
I don't owe you a thang
But we ain't gettin' married
I ain't buying you no diamond ring
That's alrightThat's all you gettin' now baby
That's all you get
That's all you gettin' now baby
That's all you get
That's all you get now mama
That's all you get
Just me and this guitar baby
That's all you get
Well ain't got no apologies
Won't be no fairy tale
I ain't got no excuses baby
I am going ridin' up hill
I don't owe you a thang baby
I don't owe you a thang
I don't owe you a thang now baby
I don't owe you a thang
But we ain't gettin' married
I ain't buying you no diamond ring
I ain't got no money
Ain't got no car
Ain't got no excuses baby
I am hanging out at the barI don't owe you a thang baby
I don't owe you a thang
I don't owe you a thang now baby
I don't owe you a thang
But we ain't gettin' married, nah
