[Verse 1]
Heavy humid night, corner of Park and Main
Cast that first glance: your smile, my veins
At maximum capacity, blood pumping so fast
My girl, if looks gave heart attacks
The dangerous men in the shadows were like an audience, and even the meanest among them had a special little shine in their eyes when they saw us walk by
Walked about twenty blocks talking about good bars and better towns than this one
Kissed that first night, and then the rain opened up the sky to get
[Chorus]
One last kiss, I love you like an alcoholic
One last kiss, I love you like a statuette
One last kiss, I need you like I need a broken leg
[Verse 2]
I was getting off the late shift
Attempting to recover
Crumpled up the bus pass
Tossed it into the gutter
Some handsome dark stranger
You were standing there on the corner
You had those compelling magnetized eyes you must have lost when you got older
Seven blocks in, my fingers brushed your hand
I blushed and you laughed, but you seemed a little sad
I ain't one to jump a ship, but I absolutely knew
I was six steps in when I fell into you
[Chorus]
One last kiss, I love you like a broken pot
One last kiss, I love you like a pack of dogs
One last kiss, I need you like I need a gaping head wound
One last kiss, I love you like an alcoholic
One last kiss, I love you like a négligée
One last kiss, I need you like I need a broken leg
