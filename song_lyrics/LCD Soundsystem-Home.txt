Take me home
Just do it right
Make it perfect and real
Because it's everything
Though everything was never the deal
So grab your things and stumble into the night
So we can shut the door
And shut the door on terrible times, oh
Yeah, do it right
And head again into space
So you can carry on
And carry on, and fall all over the place
This is the trick, forget a terrible year
That we can break the laws
Until it gets weird
