[Verse 1]
I got a picture of us back when we were close
Before we had somebody picking out our clothes
But you always dressed in your Sunday best
Even when we didn't have nowhere to go
[Verse 2]
I got a picture of us playing in a bar
And your shirt cost more than your guitar
But you played so heavy and you always let me
Sing a couple even though you were the star
[Chorus 1]
I was the worse of the two of us
But Rex's Blues wasn't through with us
You were bound for glory and grown to die
Oh, but why wasn't I?
Why wasn't I?
[Verse 3]
Saw a picture of you laughing with your child
And I hope she will remember how you smiled
But she probably wasn't old enough the night somebody sold you stuff
That left you on the bathroom tiles
[Verse 4]
Got a picture of you dying in my mind
With some ghosts you couldn't bear to leave behind
But I can hear your voice ring as you snap another B-string
And you finish off the set with only five
And for a minute there, you're still alive
[Chorus 1]
I was the worse of the two of us
But Rex's Blues wasn't through with us
You were bound for glory and grown to die
Oh, but why wasn't I?
Why wasn't I?
[Chorus 2]
It's not up to me to forgive you
For the nights that your love had to live through
Now you'll never need to look me in the eye
I am the last of the two of us
But the Fort Worth Blues isn't through with us
You've traveled beyond the Great Divide
Oh, but why haven't I?
Why haven't I?
