[Verse 1]
Run, run, don't trail behind keep moving
The beasts won't stop till we're dead
All the scrapes on our knees
Will tell you where we've been, where we have bled
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh we play
In autumn days
[Chorus]
Won't lay down our heads till the day is won
Won't stop running till we reach the sun
Chasing all the things that are keeping us young
We won't stop running till we reach the sun
[Verse 2]
Oh we're building a home
With the mud and the stones and the branches we find
We're all just searching for something
Bigger than we're all able to find
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh we play
In autumn days
[Chorus]
Won't lay down our heads till the day is won
Won't stop running till we reach the sun
Chasing all the things that are keeping us young
We won't stop running till we reach the sun
[Bridge]
We are all creatures of the sunlight
We are all children of the day
We are just chasing what we can't ever get, ever have
[Chorus]
Won't lay down our heads till the day is won
Won't stop running till we reach the sun
Chasing all the things that are keeping us young
We won't stop running till we reach the sun
[Outro]
All the scrapes on our knees
Will tell you where weâ€™ve been, where we have bled
