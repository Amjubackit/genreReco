[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
The cycle repeated
As explosions broke in the sky
All that I needed
Was the one thing I couldn't find
[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
And you were there at the turn
Waiting to let me know
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
We're building it up to break it back down
We're building it up to burn it down
We can't wait to burn it to the ground
[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
The colors conflicted
As the flames climbed into the clouds
I wanted to fix this
But couldn't stop from tearing it down
[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
And you were there at the turn
Caught in the burning glow
And I was there at the turn
Waiting to let you know
