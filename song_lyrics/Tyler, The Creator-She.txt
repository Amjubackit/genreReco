[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
Golden rubbers in these denim pockets (
Denim pockets
)
On my waist, there's a black Glock (
Black Glock
)
New girl moved on the block (
On the 
block
)
She been plottin' on my brown cock (
Brown 
cock
)
Last night, I slept over hers (
Over hers
)
During sex, I overheard (
I overheard
)
A sword sliced the air, I pulled out the na-na
Rolled off the bed, then shot back, pow-pow
Blood on the sheets, probably spillin' from my gash
Looked out the glass, seen him sprintin' on the grass
A real ninja, with the blade and the mask
Had them gold ninja stars, and red Supreme nunchuks
Now, she tryna patch me up, but
Girl, I was just tryna get a nut bust
If that's your ex, you should probably own a pistol
But I'm guessin' it's wiser to exit with dude
[Chorus: Frank Ocean & 
Tyler, The Creator
]
The blinds wide open so he can (Ooh)
See you in the dark when you're sleepin' (Ooh)
Naked body, fresh out the shower
And you touch yourself after hours (Ah, ah)
Ain't no man allowed in your bedroom (Ah, ah)
You're sleeping alone in bed (Ooh, ooh)
But check your window 
(
Swag
)
He's at your window
