[Verse 1]
Since I let you go
I don't need no help
Mirror crystal clear, I
Finally know myself
So I make my way home, I'm in it alone, but I
I got everything I need
So turn up the AC and let myself breathe 'cause I
I can't settle for maybes, baby
[Chorus]
Love is not enough, girl
Ooh
I just need more
Some more
Love is not enough, girl
Hoo
I just need more
More
More
[Verse 2]
I make my way home, I'm in it alone, but I
I got everything I need
So turn up the AC and let myself breathe 'cause I
I can't settle for maybes baby
