[Chorus]
That girl is vicious, she's vicious
Got venom in her kisses
She's wicked, she's wicked
Yet somehow so delicious
And I love how she devours me
Just might make her my missus
She's vicious, she's vicious
Got venom in her kisses
[Verse 1]
She's a little bit twisted, little bit wild
Little bit fucked up, that's my style
Little bit ruthless, little bit raw
Razor blade tucked inside of her bra
Lovin' that pain, she roughin' me up
Guess I do too cause I'm stupid in love
Beautiful, angry, sеxy when stoned
Bites my nеck and she breaks my phone
[Pre-Chorus]
And I love the way you hate me
You love to drive me crazy
Why do I do this to myself?
It's bad for my health
