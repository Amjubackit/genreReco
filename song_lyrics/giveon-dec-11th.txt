[Verse]
Butterflies in my stomach, enough to make me fly away
Pretty brown eyes, I seen you from a mile away
But I was on the stage
So I couldn't get your name, but
Baby girl, I got your face
Can’t believe I lost you in the crowd
I think about you every day
And girl, I won't be here for long (For long)
So baby, if you hear this song, can you come to me?
Pretty brown skin in Houston, I could use your company
Ooh-woah, oh-woah, oh
[Outro: Crowd Cheering]

GIVĒON, GIVĒON, GIVĒON
