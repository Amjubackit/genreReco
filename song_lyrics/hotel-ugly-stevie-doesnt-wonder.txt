[Intro]
Feel so high
You’ve been switching up and telling me lies
I’ve been waiting for you to change (Lalalalala)
Fight or flight
But I’ll stay with you tonight
There’s a lot of things I can’t explain (Lalalala)
[Pre-Chorus]
Baby call me one more time
Moving fast, left me behind
There’s a lot of things that I could say
[Chorus]
I could take us anywhere (Take us anywhere)
Trail your face into my head
There’s a lot of things I can’t forget
I could take my memories (Take my memories)
And paint your picture in my dreams
There’s a lot of things that I regret (Lalalala)
[Interlude]
Ooh, ooh
[Chorus]
I could take us anywhere (Take us anywhere)
Trail your face into my head
There’s a lot of things I can’t forget
I could take my memories (Take my memories)
And paint your picture in my dreams
There’s a lot of things that I regret
(Lalalala)
[Outro]
Ooh, ooh
