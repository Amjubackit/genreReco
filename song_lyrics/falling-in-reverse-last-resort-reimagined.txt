[Intro]
Cut my life into pieces, this is my last resort
Suffocation, no breathing
Don't give a fuck, if I cut my arm bleeding
This is my last resort
[Verse 1]
Cut my life into pieces
I've reached my last resort – suffocation, no breathing
Don't give a fuck if I cut my arm bleeding
Do you even care if I die bleeding?
Would it be wrong, would it be right
If I took my life tonight? Chances are that I might
Mutilation out of sight
And I'm contemplating suicide, I'm contemplating suicide
[Chorus]
'Cause I'm losing my sight, losing my mind
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine
Losing my sight, losing my mind
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine, I am fine
[Verse 2]
I never realizеd I was spread too thin
'Til it was too late and I was empty within
Feeding on chaos and living in sin
Downward spiral, whеre do I begin?
It all started when I lost my mother
No love for myself, and no love for another
To find a love upon a higher level
Finding nothing but questions and devils
[Chorus]
'Cause I'm losing my sight, losing my mind
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine
Losing my sight, losing my mind
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine
Nothing is fine
[Bridge]
I'm crying, I'm crying
I'm crying, I'm crying
I can't go on living this way (Oh-oh-oh)
I can't go on living this way (Oh-oh-oh)
Cut my life into pieces, oh-oh-oh (I can't go on living this way, I can't go on living this way)
Cut my life into pieces, yeah! (I can't go on living this way, I can't go on living this way)
[Chorus]
'Cause I'm losing my sight, losing my mind
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine
Losing my sight, losing my mind
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine (I can't go on living this way)
Nothing is fine (I can't go on living this way)
[Outro]
I'm running and I'm crying (I can't go on living this way)
I'm running and I'm crying (I can't go on living this way)
I'm running and I'm crying (I can't go on living this way)
Nothing's alright
