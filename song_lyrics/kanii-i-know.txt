[Verse 1]
I know you understand
I can't leave you alone
I give you my time, but you can't pick up the phone
Life done been so tragic, huh
It won't leave me alone
Try not to be obsessive
[Chorus]
I fucked up, oh girl, I know, I know, I know
I fucked up, oh girl, I know, I know, I know
I fucked up, oh girl, I know, I know, I know
I fucked up, oh girl, I know, I know, I know
Oh-ah
[Verse 2]
You only gon' text me when you're bored
Don't like the feeling of being ignored
Told you we're too grown for this, make your choice
Told you I'm too bold for this, already on it
She wanna spend some time away, she wanna spend some timе
I can't give my heart away, I'm too in my mind
I can't give my cards away, I'm too in my grind
Lеarned this shit the harder way, now I'm in my prime
[Chorus]
I fucked up, oh girl, I know, I know, I know
I fucked up, oh girl, I know, I know, I know
I fucked up, oh girl, I know, I know, I know
I fucked up, oh girl, I know, I know, I know
Oh-ah
I fucked up, oh girl, I know, I know, I know
I fucked up, oh girl, I know, I know, I know
I fucked up, oh girl, I know, I know, I know
I fucked up, oh girl, I know, I know, I know
Oh-ah[Outro]
I fucked up, oh girl, I know
I fucked up, oh girl, I know
I fucked up, oh girl, I know
I fucked up, oh girl, I know
I fucked up, oh girl, I know
I fucked up, oh girl, I know
I fucked up, oh girl, I know
I fucked up, oh girl, I know
