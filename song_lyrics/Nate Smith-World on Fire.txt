[Verse 1]
Girl, when you called it quits
You could have done it right
You coulda left this town out of it
When you said goodbye
[Pre-Chorus]
You ruined everything I love
Ripped my heart right out my chest
Girl, it's like there ain't nothing left
[Chorus]
You set my world on fire
Yeah, it's all long gone
I'm watching flames get higher
And I can't move on
I just gotta let it burn, burn, burn on down
Girl, without you it don't turn, turn, turn around
You set my world on fire
You set my world on fire
[Verse 2]
Can't hit that corner bar
Can't even ride them roads
Don't know my way around this place
I can't see through the smoke
