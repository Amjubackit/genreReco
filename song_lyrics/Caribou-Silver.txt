[Intro]
I can make things silver
Give me a little bit of sympathy
[Verse 1]
Every time I leave you girl
He's the one that's near you girl, oh, I
Even as I drive away
I can hear the words he'll say, oh, I
[Chorus]
I guess I don't need her
It doesn't mean I can't get over her
Where you gonna go without me tonight?
Don't you know what that means to me?
[Refrain]
I can make things silver
Give me a little bit of sympathy
[Refrain]
I can make things silver
[Verse 2]
You were in my dream again
And I could see you kissing him, oh, girl
Why'd you have to change your mind
Just as I was changing mine? Oh, girl
