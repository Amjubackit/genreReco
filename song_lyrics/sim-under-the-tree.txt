[SiM「UNDER THE TREE」歌詞]
[Verse 1]
Where are you at?
Where have you been?
問いかけに答えはなく
Where are we headed?
What did you mean?
追いかけても 遅く 遠く
[Verse 2]
A bird, a butterfly and my red scarf
Don't make a mess of memories
Just let me heal your scars
The wall, the owl, and forgotten wharf
時が止まることもなく
[Pre-Chorus]
We're getting older
Second, by second, by second
[Chorus]
Why, oh, why? Why, oh, why?
Don't you wanna stay with me?
Why, oh, why? Why, oh, why?
Are you giving up on me?[Post-Chorus]
I'll be waiting, waiting for you
Let me hold you under the tree
Under the tree-ee-ee, ee-ee-ee
Eе-ee-ee-ee
[Outro]
I'll protect you!
