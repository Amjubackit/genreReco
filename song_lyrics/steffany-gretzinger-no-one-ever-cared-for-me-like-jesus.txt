[Verse 1]
If my heart could tell a story
If my life would sing a song
If I have a testimony
If I have anything at all
[Chorus]
No one ever cared for me like Jesus
His faithful hand has held me all this way
And when I'm old and gray and, all my days
Are numbered on the earth
Let it be known, in You alone
My joy was found
Oh my joy, my joy
[Verse 2]
Let my children tell their children
Let this be their memory
That all my treasure was in heaven
And You were everything to me
[Chorus]
No one ever cared for me like Jesus
His faithful hand has held me all this way
And when I'm old and gray and, all my days
Are numbered on the earth
Let it be known, in You alone
My joy was found
I found my joy
