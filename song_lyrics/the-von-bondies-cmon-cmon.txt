[Verse 1]
On another day; c'mon c'mon
With these ropes I tied, can we do no wrong
Now we grieve cause now is gone
Things were good when we were young
[Pre-Chorus]
With my teeth locked down, I could see the blood
Of a thousand men who have come and gone
Now we grieve cause now is gone
Things were good when we were young
[Chorus]
Is it safe to say? (c'mon c'mon)
Was it right to leave? (c'mon c'mon)
Will I ever learn? (c'mon c'mon)
(c'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon)
[Verse 2]
As I make my way; c'mon c'mon
These better nights that seem too long
Now we grieve cause now is gone
Things were good when we were young
[Pre-Chorus]
With my teeth locked down, I could see the blood
Of a thousand men who have come and gone
Now we grieve cause now is gone
Things were good when we were young
[Chorus]
Is it safe to say? (c'mon c'mon)
Was it right to leave? (c'mon c'mon)
Will I ever learn? (c'mon c'mon)
(c'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon)
[Chorus]
Is it safe to say? (c'mon c'mon)
Was it right to leave? (c'mon c'mon)
Will I ever learn? (c'mon c'mon)
(c'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon)
[Outro]
And know this day these deepened wounds don't heal so fast
Can't hear me croon of a million lies that speak no truth
Of a time gone by the now is through
