[Intro]
All my friends just wanna be famous
Living life with a lot of time wasted
I choose You, You're what's missing
I choose You, now I'm different
Everyone's saying I'm crazy
Good thing they're not God who made me
So let 'em talk, it don't phase me
I'm gonna give You all my praises
[Verse 1: Jordan Holliday]
It's different now
I see Your love, see it all around
Nothing's gonna keep it down
I gotta praise, gotta let it out
Gonna let it out
[Pre-Chorus: Jordan Holliday]
One thing is true, I was made to love You
[Chorus: Jordan Holliday]
All my friends just wanna be famous
Living life with a lot of time wasted
I choose You, You're what's missing
I choose You, now I'm different
Evеryone's saying I'm crazy
Good thing they're not God who madе me
So let 'em talk, it don't phase me
I'm gonna give You all my praises
[Post-Chorus: Jordan Holliday]
I'm gonna give You my praises
I'm gonna give You my praises
You're too good, too good to contain it
I'm gonna give You all my praises
[Verse 2: Jordan Holliday]
It's different now
I got a million reasons to be loud
All creation, make a joyful sound
Let every breath sing His praises out
Sing His praises out
[Pre-Chorus: Jordan Holliday]
One thing is true, I was made to love—Hands up!
[Chorus: Jordan Holliday]
All my friends just wanna be famous
Living life with a lot of time wasted
I choose You, You're what's missing
I choose You, now I'm different
Everyone's saying I'm crazy
Good thing they're not God who made me
So let 'em talk, it don't phase me
I'm gonna give You all my praises
[Post-Chorus: Jordan Holliday]
I'm gonna give You my praises
I'm gonna give You my praises
You're too good, too good to contain it
I'm gonna give You all my praises

[Outro: Jordan Holliday]
You're too good, too good to contain it
I'm gonna give You all my praises
