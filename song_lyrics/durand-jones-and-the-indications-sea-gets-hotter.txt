[Verse 1]
Remember the first time that your shadow crossed my door
Sun from the shoreline made the dust dance 'cross my floor
Easy days of healing the scars from the battles that we won
I read the headlines, says there's harder roads to come
[Chorus]
Said the sea gets hotter
And the drums beat louder
And world seems colder
Singing that same old tune
And the times get harder
World's weight upon us
But it don't mean nothin'
Cause we're leavin' soon
[Post-Chorus]
And so we cruise, baby
Just you and me
And so we cruise, baby
'Til land meets sea
[Verse 2]
A hand on the wheel now and the other on your knee
Ain't worried 'bout nothin' 'cause I feel you next to me
Grayin' with the gatherin' storm and the smoke hangs on the breeze
I know that I got you and you know that you got me
[Chorus]
Said the sea gets hotter
And the drums beat louder
And world seems colder
Singing that same old tune
And the times get harder
World's weight upon us
But it don't mean nothin'
Cause we're leavin' soon
[Post-Chorus]
And so we cruise, baby
Just you and me
And so we cruise, baby
'Til land meets sea
So we cruise, baby
Just you and me
And so we cruise, baby
'Til land meets sea
So we cruise, baby
Just you and me
And so we cruise, baby
