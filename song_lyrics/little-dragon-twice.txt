[Verse 1]
Twice I turn my back on you
I fell flat on my face but didn't lose
Tell me where would I go
Tell me what led you on, I'd love to know
[Chorus]
Was it the blue night, gone fragile?
Was it about the men, in wonder steady going under?
Was it the light ways, so frightening?
Was it a two wills? One mirror holding us dearer now
[Verse 2]
Thought I had an answer once
But your random away swept me along
Colossal signs so I got lost
With so many lovers singing songs
[Chorus]
Was it the blue night, gone fragile?
Was it about the men, in wonder steady going under?
Was it the light ways, so frightening?
Was it a two wills? One mirror holding us dearer now
