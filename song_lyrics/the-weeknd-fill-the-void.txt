[Intro: Ramsey]
(Void)

[Verse 1: Lily-Rose Depp]
I don't wanna decide things for myself, on my own
Finally, for the first time, I'm alone
You call me, havin' good times with a bad boy
Seems I've got a choice to make
Be my voice and I choose you to fill the void
[Chorus: Ramsey]
(Void) I choose you to fill my void, yeah
(Void) I choose you to tell me, you to tell me
(Voice) I choose you to fill my void, yeah
(Voice) Be my voice and I choose you to fill the void
[Verse 2: Lily-Rose Depp, The Weeknd]
Ooh, tell me why, tell me why do I feel so free when I'm dead?
Oh, when I'm tied on to your short leash
Ooh, tell me why, tell me why do I feel so free when I'm dead?
Oh, when I'm tied on to your short leash (Oh)
[Verse 3: The Weeknd]
Give it up, give up that threesome
Goddamn, you look good in this lighting
Fill it up, fill a prescription
Feel numb while we're intertwining
I'm in love with both at the same time
She'll go down while I hit it from behind
You're the one, you're the only one
Baby girl, we could both have fun, yeah
[Chorus: The Weeknd]
Oh, I choose you to fill your void, yeah
Oh, I choose you to fill you up, to fill you up, hey
Oh, I choose you to fill the void, yeah
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah
[Outro: The Weeknd]
Oh, woah
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
