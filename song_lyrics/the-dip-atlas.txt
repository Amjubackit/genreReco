[Verse 1]
Heard you coming in the back door at three a.m
You spent the night in the hospital sitting next to your best friend
Woke up three hours later just to go downtown
I've known you long enough to see it's starting to wear you down
[Chorus]
Don't put the world on your shoulders
Cause you know it ain't your load to bear
[Verse 2]
I ask you how your day was and you muster up a smile
I wish you'd take a minute for yourself once and a while
You've got a bigger heart than anyone that I have ever known
But you got to see it's killing me the way you're carrying on so
[Chorus]
Don't put the world on your shoulders
Cause you know it ain't your load to bear
Don't put the world on your shoulders
Cause you know it ain't your load to bear alone
[Bridge]
(Feel the pressure rising)
Feel that pressure building up inside of you
Don't know what to do, don't know what to do
It's too much for one person to hold
Or to hold onto[Chorus]
Woah don't put the world on your shoulders
Cause you know it ain't your load to bear alone
Don't put the world on your shoulders baby
Woah it ain't your load to bear
(Don't put the world on your shoulders)
Don't put the world on your shoulders
(Don't put the world on your shoulders)
Baby cause it ain't your load to bear
(Don't put the world on your shoulders)
Don't put the world on your shoulders
(Don't put the world on your shoulders)
(Don't put the world on your shoulders)
