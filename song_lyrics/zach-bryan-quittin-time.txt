[Verse 1]
This labor I've been doing ain't got no reason or rhyme
And I can't hardly wait for it to finally be quittin' time
And I've been pushing steel through a run down Rust Belt plant
And I can't wait to head on home, so I can take my gal to dance
How I'll take my gal to dance
Oh, I'll take my gal to dance
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 2]
The desert sure is hot and we've been working through the days
I pray I get back to my loving lady's gaze
Rifle in my hand and some brothers to my side
I can't hardly wait for it to finally be quittin' time
Oh, I pray it'll be quittin' time
Oh, one day it'll be quittin' time
[Chorus]
Quittin' time's on my mind
But her kind eyes are on my heart
I've been swеatin' for my wages
But she'll cool me aftеr dark
How she'll cool me after dark
I know she'll cool me after dark
[Instrumental Break - Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
And I've been roofing houses atop of homes I can't afford
But I'm saving all my pennies and I'm prayin' to the Lord
One day we'll make it through all this barely gettin' by
I'm taking out my woman and we're dancin' barefoot tonight
[Chorus]
Quittin' time's on my mind
But her kind eyes are on my heart
I've been sweating for my wages
But she'll cool me after dark
How she'll cool me after dark
Oh, she'll cool me after dark
[Instrumental Outro]
