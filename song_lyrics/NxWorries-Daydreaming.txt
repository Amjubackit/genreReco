[Verse 1: Anderson .Paak]
I'll be outside, underneath the balcony
Knew you was mine when you threw down the key
Up all night, tryin' all kinds of things (
Yeah
)
Love of your life, you know that I'm tryna be
[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
Daydreamin', when I met you, never met you
Kiss me, let me know that it's real
Daydreamin', when I met you, can't forget you
Kiss me, let me know that it's real
[Verse 2: Anderson .Paak]
Girl, you're so fine, shinin' like a diamond ring
Look me in the eyes and tell me you would diе for me
Bonnie and Clyde, likе it's 2003
 (
Yeah
)
Love of your life, you know that I gotta be
[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
Daydreamin', when I met you, never met you
Kiss me, let me know that it's real
Daydreamin', when I met you, can't forget you
Kiss me, let me know that it's real
[Break]
Uh
Yeah
