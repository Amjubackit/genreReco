[Verse 1]
Weather controls your day
People make up your mind
Until you can't even tell
When someone gives you a sign
But we make the ground our grave by layin' in it
We make our problems fade by facin' 'em
We make the wind our wings by raisin' your arms
At the top of the world, yeah
[Chorus]
Put 'em on trial (On trial)
Make 'em dance for it in the courthouse
Make a stand for it or it don't count (Or it don't count)
Be the landlord of the whole town (Of the whole town)
Put 'em on edgе (On edge)
Make thе judge jump and hit the two-step (Yeah, hit the two-step)
And make the jury come up with two guesses (Come up with two guesses)
And lose interest, then they make up a new sentence
[Verse 2]
Ayy, hell or high water, we cover for you like camouflage
And it's not over 'til a fat woman sing hella high (
Hey
)
Tap dancin' in my (
Hey
)
Until I feel a change in my day-to-day on a daily basis
We make the love that keeps our world spinnin'
We make the gods our friends by cursin' em
We make the wind our wings by raisin' your arms
At the top of the world, yeah
