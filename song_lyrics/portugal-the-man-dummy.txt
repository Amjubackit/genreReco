[Intro]
Duh, duh, duh, duh
Duh, duh, duh, duh
Duh, duh, doo, duh-duh
Duh, duh-duh, duh-duh-duh, uh
Duh, duh, doo, duh-duh
Duh, duh-duh, duh-duh-duh, aw
[Verse 1]
My religion is
A piano hangin' over my head 'bout to break free
And I see it movin'
Gotta pick up the groove and let go
Everyone I know
Is running from the afterlife
[Pre-Chorus]
These days, they make it sound sweet
If this is the last dance, you can count on me
[Chorus]
One, two, three, four
Everybody get on the dance floor
Five, six, seven, eight
It's 4 a.m. and I'm wide awake
One, two, three, four
Everybody get on the dance floor
Five, six, seven, eight
I pray the Lord my soul to take[Post-Chorus]
Duh, duh, doo, duh-duh
Duh, duh-duh, duh-duh-duh, uh
Duh, duh, doo, duh-duh
Duh, duh-duh, duh-duh-duh, aw
[Verse 2]
Way my phone is ringin'
Paint a tunnel on the wall, escape before the anvil falls
Gotta keep them movin'
Gotta pick up the groove and let go
Everyone I know
Is running from the afterlife
[Pre-Chorus]
These days, they make it sound sweet
If this is the last dance, you can count on me
[Chorus]
One, two, three, four
Everybody get on the dance floor
Five, six, seven, eight
It's 4 a.m. and I'm wide awake
One, two, three, four
Everybody get on the dance floor
Five, six, seven, eight
I pray the Lord my soul to take[Bridge]
The light is going out
The light in my life is going out
The light is going out
The light in my life is going out
[Outro]
One, two, three, four
Five, six, seven, eight
Gotta pick up the groove and let go
