(SOLO) then [Chorus]
I give myself away
I give myself away
So You can use me(2x)
[Verse 1]
Here I am
Here I stand
Lord, my life is in your hands
Lord, I'm longing to see
Your desires revealed in me
I give myself away
I give myself away
So You can use me
[Verse 2]
Take my heart
Take my life
As a living sacrifice
All my dreams, all my plans
Lord I place them in your hands
I give myself away
I give myself away
So You can use me
[Chorus]
I give myself away
I give myself away
So You can use me (2x)
[Bridge]
My life is not my own,To you I belong
I give myself, I give myself to You(2x)
I give myself away
I give myself away
So You can use me
