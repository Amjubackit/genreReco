[Verse 1]
I've been living without you
I know all about you
I have run you down into the ground
Spread disease about you over town
[Verse 2]
I used to adore you
I couldn't control you
There was nothing that I wouldn't do
To keep myself around and close to you
[Chorus 1]
Do you have an opinion?
A mind of your own?
I thought you were special
I thought you should know
But I've run out of patience
I couldn't care less
[Refrain]
Do you have an opinion?
A mind of your own?
I thought you were special
I thought you should know
[Verse 3]
I used to amuse you
I knew that I'd lose you
Now you're here and begging for a chance
But there's no way in hell I'd take you back
[Chorus 2]
Do you have an opinion?
A mind of your own?
I thought you were special
I thought you should know
But I've run out of patience
I've run out of comments
I'm tired of the violence
I couldn't care less
[Outro]
I'm looking for a new
I'm looking for a new
I'm looking for a new
I'm looking for a new
We were the talk of the town
We were the talk of the town
We were the talk of the town
We were the talk of the town
I thought you were special
I thought you were special
I thought you were special
I thought you were special
