[Verse 1]
I never get lonely
I got these ghosts to keep me company
I took the rearview off of this old Ford so I only see in front of me
Now the past is out of sight and out of mind
Swore I changed, now I'm back chasing these white lines
[Chorus]
I'm just a long-haired son of a sinner
Searching for new ways I can get gone
I'm a pedal to the highway if you ever wonder why we write these songs
'Cause I'm only one drink away from the devil
I'm only one call away from home
Yeah, I'm somewherе in the middle
I guess I'm just a littlе
Right and wrong
[Verse 2]
These backroads got me
These pills pretend to be my friend
I'm done for the last time
I'm lying to myself again
I always say that
Now I'm on my way back here somehow
I should know by now
