[Verse 1]
My hands are searching for you
My arms are outstretched towards you
I feel you on my fingertips
My tongue dances behind my lips, for you
This fire runs in through my being
Burning, I'm not used to seeing you
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm alive
I'm alive
[Chorus]
I can feel you all around me
Thickening the air I'm breathing
Holding on to what I'm feeling
Savoring this heart that's healing
[Verse 2]
My hands float up above me
And you whisper you love me
And I begin to fade
Into our secret place
The music makes me sway
The angels singing, say "We are alone with you"
I am alone and they are too with you
