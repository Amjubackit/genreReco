I'm lost
And I can't seem to find my way home
I've been burning up time
Burning out my mind
On an endless winding road
All my burdens keep me hurtin'
Ever present; ever certain
All alone, they keep eating up my soul
It's hard to see the future
When the present doesn't suit ya
Every day feels like a blinding cold
Blinding cold
There's a hole in my energy
It's burning out my sanity
Eroding the thrill of getting old
I don't fit in with society
Its blinding my integrity
While undermining my goals
It's blurring my intensity
And muting my ability
To avoid the bumps in the roadI can't execute the skills I need
Relax and keep my dreaming free
While stumbling out in the cold
I've been struggling for way way too long
It's time for a change I'm ready to move on
And, yes, I'm scared to right all my wrongs
But I'll be okay, I'm stronger than I thought
They're getting bold with technology
It's eating up our decency
So why do I feel so alone?
I'm disconnected from my family
My friends don't wanna talk to me
It's getting out of control
I turned from my destiny
And filled it with an evil seed
That soon began to take hold
The truth was right in front of me
That all along I held the key
To let me in from cold
In from the coldAnd I'm not gonna waste one minute of this life
I got a second chance to do what is right
I'm gonna dance in the rain, and lay out in the sunshine
Take all my pain and turn it in into moonlight
Take all my pain, and melt it with the sunshine
Take all my pain, and turn it into white light
Take all my pain, and give myself a good life
