[Verse 1]
Be still and know
That the Lord is in control
Be still my soul
Stand and watch as giants fall
[Chorus]
I won't be afraid 'cause You are here
You silence all my fear
I won't be afraid, You don't let go
Be still my heart and know
I won't be afraid
[Verse 2]
Be still and trust
What the Lord has said is done
Find rest, don't strive
Watch as faith and grace align
[Chorus]
I won't be afraid, You are here
You silence all my fear
I won't be afraid, You don't let go
Be still my heart and know
I won't be afraid
I won't be afraid[Bridge]
