[Verse 1]
There's something 'bout the way
The street looks when it's just rained
There's a glow off the pavement, you walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parking lot, yeah
Oh, yeah
[Verse 2]
We're driving down the road, I wonder if you know
I'm trying so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool, run your hands through your hair
Absent-mindedly making me want you
[Chorus]
And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fеarless
[Verse 3]
So, baby, drive slow 'til we run out of road in this onе-horse town
I wanna stay right here, in this passenger's seat
You put your eyes on me
In this moment now, capture it, remember it
