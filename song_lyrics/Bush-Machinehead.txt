[Bridge]
Breathe in, breathe out
Breathe in, breathe out
Breathe in
Breathe in, breathe out
Breathe in, breathe out
Breathe in
[Verse 1]
Tied to a wheel, our fingers got to feel
Bleeding through a tourniquet smile
I spin on a whim, I slide to the right
I felt you like electric light
For our love, for our fear
For our rise against the years and years and years
[Chorus]
Got a machinehead, it's better than the rest
Green to red, machinehead
Got a machinehead, it's better than the rest
Green to red
I walk from my machine
I walk from my machine
[Bridge]
Breathe in, breathe out
Breathe in, breathe out
Breathe in
