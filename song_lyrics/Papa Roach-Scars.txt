[Intro]
I tear my heart open—I sew myself shut
And my weakness is that I care too much
And my scars remind me that the past is real
I tear my heart open just to feel
[Verse 1]
I'm drunk and I'm feeling down
And I just want to be alone
I'm pissed 'cause you came around
Why don't you just go home?
'Cause I've channeled all your pain
And I can't help you fix yourself
You're making me insane
All I can say is:
[Chorus]
I tear my heart open—I sew myself shut
And my weakness is that I care too much
And our scars remind us that the past is real
Tear my heart open just to feel
[Verse 2]
I tried to help you once
Against my own advice
I saw you goin' down
But you never realized
That you're drowning in the water
And I offered you my hand
Compassions in my nature
Tonight is our last stand
