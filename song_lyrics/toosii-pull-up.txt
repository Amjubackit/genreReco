[Intro]
(T-T-T-Think we found a LoopHole)
[Chorus: Toosii]
Yeah, tell a nigga, "Pull up," yeah
Pull up, we poppin' outside, yeah (Sheesh)
Had to switch whips like four, five times (Skrrt)
Like, two, three sticks in my ride, ayy (Skrrt, skrrt)
Tell a nigga, "Pull up" (Huh)
Pull up, be ready to die (Grrah)
Don't make me mad if you love your life
If you do, I ain't wastin' no time
[Verse 1: Toosii]
Let's see, I got the Bottegas on me (Bottegas on me)
We posted at the bodega, homie ('Dega, homie)
I love the guap, holy matrimony (Sheesh)
I done married the money, the papеr only (Woo)
Don't fuck with niggas, they fake and phony (Fake)
Why do thеse niggas be fakin' on me? (Snakes)
I'd rather do it all by my lonely
Say you want the crown, nigga, come take it from me
You want the crown, come and take it from me
I make it rain when it slick or sunny
I'm kinda small but I be with a dummy
Don't make a call if it ain't about money
They should've told you ain't nothin' funny
You should've asked why these bitches love me
I keep it on like the water been runnin'
I ain't wastin' no time if it ain't about nothin', yeah
Pull up, the seat back, uh, I know why he mad
I done put in work, no slack and it all paid off
I've been thumbin' through racks (Through racks)
Commas, I need that (What?)
I know why he mad
I've been stickin' straight to the code
Get the bag while these other niggas comin' in last
[Chorus: Toosii]
Tell a nigga, "Pull up," yeah
Pull up, we poppin' outside, yeah (Sheesh)
Had to switch whips like four, five times (Skrrt)
Like, two, three sticks in my ride, ayy (Skrrt, skrrt)
Tell a nigga, "Pull up" (Huh)
Pull up, be ready to die (Grrah)
Don't make me mad if you love your life
If you do, I ain't wastin' no time
[Verse 2: 21 Savage]
I'm Mr. Get-Out-On-Feet (21)
He tried to run through the cut
Boy, where you goin'? Get hawked down the street (21)
Glock with a switch, hit a nigga with a left hook, right hook, Muhammad Ali (On God)
If you ain't signed to no major, you better off not even askin' my fee (Straight up)
That shit a couple hundred Gs (21)
He a pussy cat like Garfield (21)
Stick make a nigga do a cartwheel (Straight up)
Since Savage Mode, it been six years (On God)
And a nigga still ain't got a heart, still (On God)
Still'll hotbox, we cartel (21)
Catch him on the highway, roadkill (21)
Walk up on a nigga, pull his coat tail (21)
Y'all niggas runnin' from the smoke still (21)
Yeah, he a rat, but he ain't got cheese (Pussy)
Givin' out sleep, who want Zs? (Pussy)
Spinnin' all summer, ain't no peace (Pussy)
Y'all chase clout, we low-key (Pussy)
Reppin' 21 'til I'm OV (21)
He need gas, he on E (21)
All that woofin', he too drunk (21)
Got his ass smashed by the OE (21, 21)
[Outro: Toosii]
Tell a nigga, "Pull up" (Pull up)
