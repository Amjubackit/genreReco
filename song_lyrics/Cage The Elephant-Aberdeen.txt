[Verse 1]
I been trying real hard to, to realize
But some things take a long, long, long, long time
Long time
[Chorus]
Hold the phone, hit repeat
Got me foamin' at the knees
Saw the flame, tasted sin
You burn me once again
Cut the cord, she's a creep
Aberdeen!
Way back, way back, way back!
[Verse 2]
Never saw my dark side in-in your eyes
Back and forth, bloody fingers painting up the sky
The sky
[Chorus]
Hold the phone, hit repeat
Got me foamin' at the knees
Saw the flame, tasted sin
But you burn me once again
Cut the cord, she's a creep
Aberdeen!
Way back, way back, way back!
