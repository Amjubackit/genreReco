[Intro]
(I'll never feel the same, okay)
[Chorus: Kanii]
You say that you need me, but I don't feel it now
You said that you would see me, but you're not coming 'round
Come and say you love me, come and say it now
Tell me that you trust me, come and tell me now
[Verse 1: Riovaz]
And time will tell if you're gonna leave
And in time, I felt like my heart's gone cold
'Cause what do you see in me?
She'll never believe in tough love
[Pre-Chorus: Nimstarr]
'Cause you're the reason my heart's racin'
Don't know why, but I'll keep chasin'
I'm tired of your liеs, I'm through with all your games
I'm done with this disguise, I'll nеver be the same
[Chorus: Kanii]
You say that you need me, but I don't feel it now
You said that you would see me, but you're not coming 'round
Come and say you love me, come and say it now
Tell me that you trust me, come and tell me now
[Verse 2: Kanii & Nimstarr, Riovaz & Kanii]
Speak your mind, oh baby, tell me what you like
You say I drive you crazy, unlike the other guys
My mind's been rollin' lately, think I'm losin' sight
I think I'm losin' vision, just say I'll be alright
[Pre-Chorus: Nimstarr & Riovaz, Nimstarr & Kanii]
'Cause you're the reason my heart's racin'
Don't know why, but I'll keep chasin'
I'm tired of your lies, I'm through with all your games
I'm done with this disguise, I'll never be the same
[Chorus: Kanii]
You say that you need me, but I don't feel it now
You said that you would see me, but you're not coming 'round
Come and say you love me, come and say it now
Tell me that you trust me, come and tell me now
