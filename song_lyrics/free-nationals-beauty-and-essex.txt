[Verse 1: Daniel Caesar]
Early sun shines through my window
Your head's on my pillow, I
Spend time feelin' on that booty
Caress you so smoothly, I
[Pre-Chorus: Daniel Caesar]
Pussy wet like an ocean, aphrodisiac potion
We both took a sip, both know what this is
Just lookin' for affection, add a piece to my collection
And maybe who knows, let's see where this goes
'Cause the head's so good, and she brings me peace
We don't talk too much, but that's fine with me
[Chorus: Daniel Caesar]
I'm lonely, you're lonely too
(Exactly what you done to me)
(Just can't let it go) I wanna be alone with you
Girl, your love is so comforting
(Girl, I think you know) I'm lonely, you're lonely too
(Exactly what you done to me)
(Just can't let it go) I wanna be alone with you
(Girl, your love is so comforting)
[Verse 2: Ruban Nielson]
Hold me, simple angel, inside your mind
Miserable and painful, way down inside
Some winning, some losing, like all the guys
Superficial boo thing, I want it bad
Run it back, been runnin' away
Runnin' all the way, only to return and stay
Oh my baby
[Chorus: Daniel Caesar]
I'm lonely, you're lonely too
(Exactly what you done to me)
(Just can't let it go) I wanna be alone with you
Girl, your love is so comforting
(Girl, I think you know) I'm lonely, you're lonely too
(Exactly what you done to me)
(Just can't let it go) I wanna be alone with you
(Girl, your love is so comforting)
[Verse 3: Daniel Caesar]
Moontime smells like sex and flowers
We've been goin' for hours, I
Feel fine, inspired completely
Serenade you sweetly, I
[Pre-Chorus: Daniel Caesar]
Pussy wet like an ocean, aphrodisiac potion
We both took a sip, both know what this is
Just lookin' for affection, add a piece to my collection
And maybe who knows, let's see where this goes
'Cause the head's so good, and she brings me peace
We don't talk too much, but that's fine with me
[Chorus: Daniel Caesar]
I'm lonely, you're lonely too
(Exactly what you done to me)
(Just can't let it go) I wanna be alone with you
Girl, your love is so comforting
(Girl, I think you know) I'm lonely, you're lonely too
(Exactly what you done to me)
(Just can't let it go) I wanna be alone with you
(Girl, your love is so comforting)
