[Verse 1]
As you brush your shoes, stand before the mirror
And you comb your hair, grab your coat and hat
And you walk wet streets tryin' to remember
All the wild night breezes in your mem'ry ever
[Chorus]
And everything looks so complete
When you're walkin' out on the street
And the wind catches your feet
Sends you flyin', cryin'
Ooo-woo-wee
The wild night is calling (Alright)
Ooo-ooh-wee
Wild night is calling
[Verse 2]
All the girls walk by dressed up for each other
And the boys do the boogie-woogie on the corner of the street
And the people passin' by stare in wild wonder
And the inside jukebox roars out just like thunder
[Chorus]
And everything looks so complete
When you're walkin' out on the street
And the wind catches your feet
Sends you flyin', cryin'
Ooo-woo-wee
Wild night is calling (Alright)
Ooo-ooh-wee
Wild night is calling (Alright)
