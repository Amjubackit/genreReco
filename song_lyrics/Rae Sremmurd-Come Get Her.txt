[Intro: Swae Lee]
Trippin'
Mike WiLL Made-It
Somebody come to the floor, it feels like we've met before
[Chorus: Swae Lee]
Somebody come get her, she's dancin' like a stripper (Right away)
Somebody come get her, she's dancin' like a stripper (Right away)
Somebody come tip her, she's dancin' like a stripper (Right away)
Somebody come get her, she's feelin' all the liquor (Right away)
[Verse 1: Swae Lee]
Chopped and screwed up
I'm a pothead, true enough (Yup)
At your ex crib and you're boo'd up (Up)
Take it slow, baby, we in no rush
Hennessy or Don Q? That's a very hard choice
For the diamonds on my pinky, need a gang of cool points
And the drop head make 'em drop dead, yeah (Ayy)
Ye ain't scared, ye ain't scared, ye ain't scared, yeah
Believe me, I'm outchea
You see me, in action
I've heard a lot, a lot about you
Passin' 'round blunts like a hot potato (Woah)
And you dancin' on the table, gushin' like volcano (Go, go, go)
