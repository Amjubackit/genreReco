[Verse 1: Fever Ray]
Memory comes when memory's old
I am never the first to know
Following the stream up North
Where do people like us float?
[Verse 2: Fever Ray]
There is room in my lap
For bruises, asses, hand claps
I will never disappear
For forever, I'll be here
[Chorus: Fever Ray]
Whispering
Morning, keep the streets empty for me
Morning, keep the streets empty for me
[Verse 3: Cecilia Nordlund]
I'm laying down, eating snow
My fur is hot, my tongue is cold
On a bed of spider web
I think of how to change myself
[Verse 4: Cecilia Nordlund]
A lot of hope in a one man tent
There's no room for innocence
Take me home before the storm
Velvet moths
 will keep us warm
