[Verse 1]
Too much of that ol' Whiskey River
Leaves a young man feeling old
That old love you still remember
Cuts you deep down in your soul
[Verse 2]
Lost that girl down in New Orleans
Chasing some old voodoo dream
Levee broke on Whiskey River
Got me trying to swim upstream
[Chorus]
Getting tired of going crazy
Headed back, Tennessee
I gotta crawl on out of this river
'Fore it drowns me in the sea
[Verse 3]
Shotgun Willie on the stereo
Words are speaking right to my heart
If I keep reaching for that bottle
It’s gonna tear my world apart
[Chorus]
Getting tired of going crazy
Headin' back, Tennessee
I gotta crawl on out of that river
'Fore it drowns me in the sea, ah-ha
