[Verse 1]
We'll do it all
Everything
On our own
We don't need
Anything or anyone
[Chorus]
If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?
[Verse 2]
I don't quite know
How to say
How I feel
Those three words
Are said too much
They're not enough
[Chorus]
If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?
Forget what we're told
Before we get too old
Show me a garden that's burstin' into life
