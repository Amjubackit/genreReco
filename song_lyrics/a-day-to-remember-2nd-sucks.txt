[Intro]
Fight!
[Verse 1]
You're afraid, like I make my deals with the devil
You've been at it for years, but couldn't reach that next level
Let's keep it real, this is no competition to me
Even if everyone around you acts like they don't see
[Chorus]
(Oh!) Is anybody else listening?
Outta sight, outta mind is what you'll always be
(Oh!) I hold my cards to my chest
I laid my life on the line, so I expect nothing less from you
[Verse 2]
I speak the truth and everybody else knows it
So set your ego to the side and just get the fuck over it
Can't waste my time on hateful people like you
So keep wishing you were me and I'll keep making you have to
[Chorus]
(Oh!) Is anybody else listening?
Outta sight, outta mind is what you'll always be
(Oh!) I hold my cards to my chest
I laid my life on the line, so I expect nothing less from you[Bridge]
I just can't believe it's really come to this
Because without me, you would not exist
[Instrumental Breakdown]
[Verse 3]
(Hey, hey!) Still got something left to say
Only one in the world that I depend on is me
I need nothing from no one, I take what I need
Get a hold of yourself, and keep away from me
[Chorus]
(Oh!) Is anybody else listening?
Outta sight, outta mind is what you'll always be
(Oh!) I hold my cards to my chest
I laid my life on the line, so I expect nothing less from you
