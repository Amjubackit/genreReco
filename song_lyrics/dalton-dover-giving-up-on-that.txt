[Verse 1]
I hate you met the sinner
Lord knows I ain't no saint
But I'm trying to lean a little more that way these days
You put up with more than I ever would've
And you left just like you should've
But since you've been gone
Ain't nothing 'round here the same
[Chorus]
'Cause girl, I've given up on
Drinking as much as I used to when I had you
Given up on, just sayin' I'm gonna change
I've given up on passing the blame
Everything made you walk out on what we had
But when it comes to wanting you back
I ain't ever giving up on that
[Verse 2]
I pray it ain't too late
For you to see what I've turned into
I just wish my working on me was working on you
But since you said goodbye
And hit me with them taillights
I swear I've changed everything, but your mind
