[Intro: Ice Cube]
Yay-yay
Get your ass up and hurr' up, uh
Ice Cube, baby
Ninety-nine, baby
I'm on the grind, baby
All the time, baby
Show me something
[Chorus: Ice Cube & 
Ms. Toi
]
You can do it, put your back into it
 (Uh)
I can do it, put your ass into it (Uh-huh)
You can do it, put your back into it
 (Yeah)
I can do it, put your ass into it
Put your back into it
, put your ass into it (Brr)
[Verse 1: Ice Cube]
Tick, tick, boom, hear me banging down these back streets
Bumpin' Blackstreet, treated like a athlete
Life ain't a track meet (No), it's a marathon
Fuck the cemetery that a nigga get buried on
We be clubbin' 'til the day we die (Yay-yay)
Nigga, ask the bartender if you think we lie
But if you think we high, nigga, think again
'Cause when it's sink or swim, you got to think to win (Uh-huh)
And if I drink this Hen', everybody'll know it
'Cause I ain't going for it, so pray to the Lord
That I don't pull out, cuss out and bust out
Go the nigga route
 (Click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click), make the trigger shout, uh
You can try to smoke an ounce to this
While I pronounce this shit, baby, bounce them tits
Mama, move them hips, baby, shake them cheeks
I got dick for days, you got ass for weeks (Yay-yay)
