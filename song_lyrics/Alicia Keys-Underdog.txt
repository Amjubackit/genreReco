[Intro]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
[Verse 1]
She was walking in the street, looked up and noticed
He was nameless, he was homeless
She asked him his name and told him what hers was
He gave her a story 'bout life
With a glint in his eye and a corner of a smile
One conversation, a simple moment
The things that change us if we notice
When we look up sometimes
[Pre-Chorus]
They said I would never make it
But I was built to break the mold
The only dream that I've been chasing is my own
[Chorus]
So I sing a song for the hustlers trading at the bus stop
Single mothers waiting on a check to come
Young teachers, student doctors
Sons on the front line knowing they don't get to run
This goes out to the underdog
Keep on keeping at what you love
You'll find that someday soon enough
You will rise up, rise up, yeah
