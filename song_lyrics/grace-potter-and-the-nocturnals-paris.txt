Un, deux, trois, quartre
Oh la la
You got me down on the floor
So what'd you bring me down here for?
You got me down on the floor
Well what'd you bring me down here for?
If I was a man I'd make my move
If I was a blade I'd shave you smooth
If I was crow, then I would caw
And if I was from Paris
If I was from Paris
I would said:
Oh-la-la-la-la-la-la, a-oh-la-la-la-la-la-la
Oh-la-la-la-la-la-la, a-oh-la-la-la-la-la-la
Hey! You got me up on your swing
So when you gonna shake that thing?
Hey! You got me up on your swing
So when you gonna shake that thing?
Cause if I was a man I'd make my move
If I was a blade I'd shave you smooth
If I was a crow, then I would caw
And if I was from Paris
If I was from Paris
I would say:
Oh-la-la-la-la-la-la, a-oh-la-la-la-la-la-la
Oh-la-la-la-la-la-la, a-oh-la-la-la-la-la-la
[solo]
If I was a man I'd make my move
If I was a blade I'd shave you smooth
If I was a crow, then I would caw
And if I was from Paris, if I was from Paris
I would go: oh-la-la-la-la-la-la
