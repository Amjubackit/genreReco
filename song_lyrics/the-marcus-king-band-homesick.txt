One more day, watch the sunrise from the highway
Lord one more night, sit alone again in the pale moonlight
And I don't know why, seems this ride takes so much longer every time
But my heart is due back south
One hundred miles, Lord they feel like a 100 years
While my sanity holds on, in my mind I hear her sing her favorite song
So damn tired of this ride, turn the headlights off let the moonlight guide
Lord it's gonna guide me back home
You're the only one that makes me homesick
You're the only one that keeps me honest
The only one
Lord the only one that keeps me from staying gone
Lord, it's been said to me, you oughta not write another love song
Lord, wouldn't they be wrong?
Dear, let me say, what's got me feeling' this way
I'll be ready again, Lord, to tackle this whole big world
As long as you let me come back home
Oooh got and 100 miles starts to feel like 100 years
As my sanity holds on, in my mind I hear her favorite song
So damn tired of this ride, turn my headlights off let the moonlight guide
Let it guide me back home
You're the only one that makes me homesick
You're the only one that keeps me honest
The only one
Lord the only one that keeps me from staying gone
You're the only one that makes me homesick
You're the only one that keeps me honest
The only one
Lord the only one that keeps me from staying gone
You're the only one that makes me homesick
You're the only one that keeps me honest
The only one
Lord the only one that keeps me from staying gone
You're the only one that makes me homesick
You're the only one that keeps me honest
The only one
Lord the only one that keeps me from staying gone
You're the only one that keeps me honest
You're the only one that makes me homesick
The only one
Lord the only one that keeps me from staying gone
