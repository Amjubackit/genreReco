[Verse 1]
You took my heart
And gave it a home
We made it through the aching parts
And I gave you my soul
Oh, we tried to kill the pain, oh
And heal these scars
But now love has had its say
And we're moving apart
[Pre-Chorus]
Well, we're chasing time
Gotta find peace of mind
And understand that
Baby, we never can
[Chorus]
Keep me in your mirror
But don't take your eyes off the road
Holding on won't get us any nearer
'Cause we got a long way to go
Sometimes it's hard to see
That some things just won't be
[Verse 2]
Now we both know (Know)
But we act so unaware
It just goes to show
Our love isn't fair
Tomorrow's never promised
Only yesterday's a guarantee
And if I'm being honest (Yeah, baby)
That's the only thing that carries me
[Pre-Chorus]
Now we're out of time
We gotta find peace of mind
And understand that
Maybe we never can (Oh)
[Chorus]
So keep me in your mirror
But don't take your eyes off the road (Oh, oh)
Holding on won't get us any nearer
'Cause we got a long way to go
Sometimes it's hard to see
That some things just won't be
