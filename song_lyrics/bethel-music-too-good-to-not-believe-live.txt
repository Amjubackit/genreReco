[Intro: Brandon Lake]
Yeah-yeah
I've seen Your power
And I’ve seen You heal
[Verse 1: Brandon Lake]
I've lived stories that have proved Your faithfulness
And I've seen miracles my mind can’t comprehend
And there is beauty in what I can't understand
Jesus, it's You, Jesus, it's You
[Chorus: Brandon Lake]
I believe
You're the wonder-working God
You're the wonder-working God
All the miracles I've seen
Too good to not believe
You're the wonder-working God
And You heal because You love
Oh, the miracles we’ll see
You’re too good to not believe
Too good to not believe
Too good to not believe (ayy-ayy)
[Verse 2: Brandon Lake]
I can't resurrect a man with my own hands
But just the mention of Your name can raise the dead
So all the glory to the only One who can
Jesus, it’s You, Jesus, it's You[Chorus: Brandon Lake & Dante Bowe, 
Dante Bowe
]
I believe
You're the wonder-working God
You're the wonder-working God
All the miracles I’ve seen
Too good to not believe
You're the wonder-working God
And You heal because You love
Oh, the miracles we'll see
You're too good to not believe
You're the wonder-working God
You're the wonder-working God
All the miracles I've seen
Too good to not believe
You're the wonder-working God
And You heal because You love
Oh, the miracles we'll see
You're too good to not believe
Too good to not believe
Too good to not believe
After everything I've seen
You're too good to not believe (I believe it)
Too good to not believe
 (Oh, I believe it)
Too good to not believe
 (Oh, You're too good to not believe)
After everything I've seen
 (Oh, oh-oh)
Too good to not believe[Interlude: Brandon Lake]
I believe, I believe it
I believe, I believe it
Oh, how my eyes have seen it, oh-oh
Oh, You're too good to not believe
You're too good to not believe, woah

And I've seen cancer disappear
I've seen metal plates dissolve
Don't you tell me He can't do it
Don't you tell me He can't do it
'Cause I've seen real-life resurrection
I've seen mental health restored
Don't you tell me He can't do it
Don't you tell me He can't do it
'Cause I've seen families reunited
I've seen prodigals return
Don't you tell me He can't do it
Don't you tell me He can't do it
'Cause I've seen troubled souls delivered
I've seen addicts finally free
Don't you tell me He can't do it
Don't you tell me He can't do it
(I've seen cancer disappear)
I've seen cancer disappear
I've seen metal plates dissolve
Don't you tell me He can't do it
Don't you tell me He can't do it
'Cause I've seen real-life resurrection
I've seen mental health restored
Don't you tell me He can't do it
Don't you tell me He can't do it
And I've seen families reunited
I've seen prodigals return
Don't you tell me He can't do it
Don't you tell me He can't do it
(There's deliverance)
I've seen troubled souls delivered
I've seen addicts finally free
Don't you tell me He can't do it
Don't you tell me He can't do it
We'll see cities in revival
And salvation flood the streets
Don't you tell me He can't do it
Don't you tell me He can't do it
We'll see glory fill the nations
Like the world has never seen
Don't you tell me He can't do it
'Cause I know that He can (Don't you tell me He can't do it)[Chorus: Brandon Lake & Dante Bowe]
I believe
You're the wonder-working God
You're the wonder-working God
All the miracles I've seen
Too good to not believe
You're the wonder-working God
And You heal because You love
Oh, the miracles we'll see
You're too good to not believe
(I believe it)
You're the wonder-working God
You're the wonder-working God
All the miracles I've seen
Too good to not believe
('Cause You are the wonder)
You're the wonder-working God
(And You heal because)
And You heal because You love
Oh, the miracles we'll see
You're too good to not believe
Too good to not believe (Just say it)
Too good to not believe
After everything I've seen
You're too good to not believe
Too good to not believe
Too good to not believe (I believe it)
After everything I've seen (I believe it)
You're too good to not believe
[Interlude: Brandon Lake]
'Cause my eyes didn't lie to me
When I see, I saw this precious girl receive arches in her feet
And my eyes didn't lie to me
When I saw that metal plate dissolve from that man's leg
My eyes don't lie, they don't lie, my ears don't lie
We hear of resurrection power
Of that precious boy who we sung over, this precious girl sung over
And this boy comes back alive, he was breathless, now he's back to life
He's living, he's breathing, because of resurrection power
[Refrain: Brandon Lake, 
Brandon Lake & Dante Bowe
]
There's nothing that our God can't do
No, there's nothing that our God can't do, say
No, there's nothing that our God can't do
No, there's nothing that my God can't do
No, there's nothing that my God 
can't do
No, there's nothing
[Bridge: Brandon Lake & Dante Bowe]
