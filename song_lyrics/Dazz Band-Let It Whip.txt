[Verse 1]
Wanna see you with it
Sho' could treat you right
Give me just a minute
Of your time tonight
We both are here to have good fun
So let it whip
We'll get to groovin'
Love your body language
Baby, let me know
You've got me sort of anxious
We both are here to have good fun
So let it whip
[Chorus]
So let it whip
(Let's whip it, baby)
Child
(Let's whip it right)
Get a grip
(Let's whip it baby)
(Work it all night)
Well, what's your trip?
(No no)
Child
C'mon let it whip
Oww-hoo
