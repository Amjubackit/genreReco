[Verse 1: blackbear]
Every morning you wake up, and you're reaching out for me
Found you someone you could have just temporarily
Everything you wanted, I knew every part about you
From your head to your toes, from your heart to your soul
[Pre-Chorus: blackbear]
And I don't wanna know
So why you gotta be that honest for?
I ain't hold your heart no more
Why you gotta make me insecure?
[Chorus: blackbear]
Who's loving you?
I don't wanna know right now
Who's loving you? Who's touching you?
I don't wanna know right now
Who's texting you? (Goddamn, who?)
I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't
I don't wanna know right now
[Post-Chorus: blackbear]
Who's loving you?
Who's touching you?
Who's loving you, you?
Who's loving you?
Who's touching you?
Who's texting you?
Who's sexting you?
Who's loving you?
I don't wanna know
