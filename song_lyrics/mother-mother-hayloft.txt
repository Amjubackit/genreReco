[Chorus: Molly Guldemond and Debra-Jean Creelman]
My daddy's got a gun
My daddy's got a gun
My daddy's got a gun
You better run
My daddy's got a gun
My daddy's got a gun
My daddy's got a gun
Ga-ga-ga-ga-ga
[Verse 1: Ryan Guldemond with Molly Guldemond and Debra-Jean Creelman]
It started with the hayloft a-creakin'
Well, it just started in the hay (
loft
)
With his long-johns on, Pop went a-creeping
Out to the barn, up to the hay
Young lovers and they are not sleeping
Young lovers in the hay (
loft
)
With his gun turned on, Pop went a-creeping
Out to the barn, up to the hay (
loft
)
[Chorus: Molly Guldemond and Debra-Jean Creelman]
My daddy's got a gun
My daddy's got a gun
My daddy's got a gun
You better run
My daddy's got a gun
My daddy's got a gun
My daddy's got a gun
Ga-ga-ga-ga-ga
