[Chorus]
Oh, Death
Whoa, Death
Won't you spare me over till another year?
[Verse 1]
Well, what is this, that I can't see?
With ice-cold hands taking hold of me
Well, I am Death, none can excel
I'll open the door to Heaven or Hell
[Verse 2]
“Oh, Death,” someone would pray
“Could you wait to call me another day?”
The children prayed, the preacher preached
Time and mercy is out of your reach
[Verse 3]
I'll fix your feet till you can't walk
I'll lock your jaw till you can't talk
I'll close your eyes so you can't see
This very hour, come and go with me
[Verse 4]
Death, I come to take the soul
Leave the body and leave it cold
To drop the flesh off of the frame
The earth and worms both have a claim
[Chorus]
Oh, Death
Whoa, Death
Won't you spare me over till another year?
[Verse 5]
My mother came to my bed
Placed a cold towel upon my head
My head is warm, my feet are cold
Death is a-moving upon my soul
[Verse 6]
Oh, Death, how you're treating me
You closed my eyes so I can't see
Well, you're hurting my body, you make me cold
You run my life right out of my soul
[Verse 7]
Oh, Death, please consider my age
Please don't take me at this stage
My wealth is all at your command
If you will move your icy hands
[Verse 8]
Oh, the young, the rich, or poor
All alike, me, you know
No wealth, no land, no silver, no gold
Nothing satisfies me but your soul
[Chorus]
Oh, Death
Whoa, Death
Won't you spare me over 'til another year
[Outro]
Won't you spare me over 'til another year
Won't you spare me over 'til another year
