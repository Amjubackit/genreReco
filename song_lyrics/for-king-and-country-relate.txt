[Verse 1: Joel Smallbone]
Has life hit you so hard that you've been knocked down?
Have you gone too far to find the middle ground?
Did they raise you so high just to pull you back down?
Have you been so lost you could never be found?
[Pre-Chorus: Luke Smallbone]
'Cause I've been real, I've been fake (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Been a sinner, been a saint (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
I've been right, I've been so, so wrong
Yeah, I've made my mistakes
[Chorus: Joel & Luke Smallbone]
I don't know what it's like to be you (Like to be you)
You don't know what it's like to be me
What if we're all the same in different kinds of ways
Can you, can you relate?
We both know what it's like to bе hurt (Ooh, ooh-ooh)
We both know what it's like to feel pain (Ooh, ooh-ooh)
But I think it's safe to say wе're on to better days
Can you, can you relate?
[Post-Chorus: Luke & Joel Smallbone]
Can you relate?
[Verse 2: Luke Smallbone]
Have you ever been left when you shoulda been loved?
Has there ever been a time when you stayed but you shoulda run?[Pre-Chorus: Joel Smallbone & Luke Smallbone]
'Cause I've been real, I've been fake (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Been a sinner, been a saint (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
I've been right, I've been so, so wrong
Yeah, I've made my mistakes
[Chorus: Joel & Luke Smallbone]
And I don't know what it's like to be you
You don't know what it's like to be me
What if we're all the same in different kinds of ways
Can you, can you relate?
We both know what it's like to be hurt (Ooh, ooh-ooh)
We both know what it's like to feel pain (Ooh, ooh-ooh)
But I think it's safe to say we're on to better days
Can you, can you relate?
[Post-Chorus: Luke & Joel Smallbone, 
Luke Smallbone
]
Can you relate? (Ooh, ooh-ooh)
Can you relate?
 (Ooh, ooh-ooh)
Can you relate?
[Outro: Joel & Luke Smallbone]
I don't know what it's like to be you
You don't know what it's like to be me
But by the grace of God we'll see each other's heart
Can you, can you relate?
