[Verse 1]
Well, I wanna send a postcard
From the edge of a place I’ve never been
And I wanna make love hard
Under the stars in the back of a beat-up old K10
And I wanna love a girl who
Doesn’t worry about the pictures when we kiss
And wake up one day and not be so hit and miss
And lay in bed all day and call that shit pure bliss
[Chorus]
Cuz I’m movin’ at God speed
Only God and my mama know what I need
And I feel the hardwood floors on my knees
As I beg you just to take it easy on me
I’m movin’ at God speed
[Verse 2]
Well, I wanna see the road melt
Into the mountains away as I drive
And make it out of this damn town alive
And not let the dreams i shouldered die
[Chorus]
Cuz I’m movin’ at God speed
Only God and my mama know what I need
And I feel the hardwood floors on my knees
As I beg you just to take it easy on me
