[Verse 1]
We float
Promise you, my mind is [made of?]
Understand that I had to wake up
Baby, it's just the way we are
Just the way we are
[Chorus]
And I'm feeling free
In my mind, you won't leave me a stray
[?] I saying [?]
In my mind, you won't leave me a stray
[Instrumental Drop]
[Chorus]
And I'm feeling free
In my mind, you won't leave me a stray
[?] I saying [?]
In my mind, you won't leave me a stray
[Chorus]
And I'm feeling free
In my mind, you won't leave me a stray
Just the way we are, [?]
In my mind, you won't leave me a stray
[Outro]
In my mind, you won't leave me a stray
