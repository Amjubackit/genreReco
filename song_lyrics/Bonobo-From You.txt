[Verse 1]
Gone like changing seasons
Alright, alright
You swear this is easy
Alright, alright
[Chorus]
Falling from you
Falling from you
Falling from you
Falling from you
[Verse 2]
You said it was all in my mind
Running through the sugarcane
Stars in my eyes
I don't wanna leave without falling back
Running from the world and I'm calling back
Hiding from the world in a cul-de-sac
Hiding from the world in a cul-de-sac
[Chorus]
Falling from you
Falling from you
Falling from you
Falling from you
