Seems like everything good is bad
And everything bad is good
Seems like everything good is bad
And everything bad is good
Your love is like the sweet forbidden fruit in life
I'm another woman's man you're another man's wife
We both know the difference between right and wrong
Life is full of temptation it's hard to be strong
Seems like everything good is bad
And everything bad is good
Seems like everything good is bad
And everything bad is good
When I kissed your lips I made a big mistake
Your love is like a habit a habit I can't break
In my heart I lied cuz in my mind I know
With you I want to be with her I still belong
Seems like everything good is bad
And everything bad is good
Seems like everything good is bad
And everything bad is good
All the things you want to be maybe wrong to society
If there's a choice between silk and satin they both feel good to meSeems like everything good is bad
And everything bad is good
Seems like everything good is bad
And everything bad is good
