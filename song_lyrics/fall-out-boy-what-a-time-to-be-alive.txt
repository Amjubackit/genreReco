[Verse 1]
Sometimes, you wonder if we're ever lookin’ back
At a picture of 2019
And sayin', "That's the way, the world, it used to be
Before our dreams started burstin’ at the seams"
We're out here and we're ready, we're here and we're ready
To livestream the apocalypse
I don't care if it's pretty, the view's so pretty
From the deck of a sinkin’ ship, yeah, oh
[Pre-Chorus]
’Cause everything is lit except my serotonin, yeah
Everything is lit but my lightning bolt brain
Everything is lit
[Chorus 1]
But, baby, please, I just need someone to hold me
Even though you don't even know me
Oh, I’m goin' neon in the night-time
Oh, what a time to be alive
[Post-Chorus]
What a time to be alive
What a time to be alive
What a time to be alive
[Verse 2]
They say that I should try meditation
But I don't wanna be with my own thoughts (own thoughts)
It never felt that much like medication
And I just wanna be your cherry on top
We're out here and we’re ready, we're here and we're ready
To livestream the apocalypse
And I'm goin' on and on and on
Make me like a charm on your necklace, oh, your necklace
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, 'cause everything is lit except my serotonin, yeah
Everything is lit but my lightning bolt brain
Everything is lit
[Chorus 1]
But, baby, please, I just need someone to hold me (Someone to hold me, yeah)
Even though you don't even know me
Oh, I'm goin' neon in the night-time
Oh, what a time to be alive
[Post-Chorus]
What a time to be alive
What a time to be alive
What a time to be alive
[Bridge]
What a time to be alive, to be alive
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus 2]
When, when, when I said, "Leave me alone", this isn't quite what I meant
I got the quarantine blues, bad news, what's left?
So, it seems the vulture's gettin' too full to fly, oh
What a time to be alive
[Post-Chorus]
What a time to be alive
What a time to be alive
What a time to be alive
[Outro]
What a time to be alive (What a time, what a time to be alive)
What a time to be alive (What a time, what a time to be alive)
What a time to be alive (What a time, what a time to be alive)
What a time to be alive
Sometimes you wonder if we're ever lookin' back
