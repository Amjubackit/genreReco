[Intro]
Come visit me on the west coast
Baby, I'll let go
Won't care about the things they say that we can't do
They hate you out on the east coast
Give you no free throws
My heart is breaking knowing you're not living like you
[Verse 1]
Please, don't shout
I think you'll make it out, no doubt
I think you'll land on your two feet
I think you'll figure these things out
I'm saying slow, your roll
You think the words stuck on my own
Are branded on the side of your face
When you don't know if anyone's home
[Pre-Chorus]
And I know, that you know, that I know, that you know it's hard
You don't have to spend your weekends in the dark
Yeah, I know, I know, I know, I know it's hard
Trying to find somebody to love
[Chorus]
Come visit me on the west coast
Baby, I'll let go
Won't care about the things they say that we can't do
They hate you out on the east coast
Give you no free throws
My heart is breaking knowing you're not living like you
[Post-Chorus]
Come visit me on the west coast
Visit me on the west coast
[Verse 2]
Please, don't move
I think you're messing up your groove
I think you're overthinking this conversation
Just get up, baby, yeah lose your mind
And I'll, be there, right behind I'll follow suit
You're secretly in love with you
Don't be afraid to show those fools
[Pre-Chorus]
And I know, that you know, that I know, that you know it's hard
You don't have to spend your weekends in the dark
Yeah, I know, I know, I know, I know it's hard
Trying to find somebody to love
[Chorus]
Come visit me on the west coast
Baby, I'll let go
Won't care about the things they say that we can't do
They hate you out on the east coast
Give you no free throws
My heart is breaking knowing you're not living like you
[Post-Chorus]
Come visit me on the west coast
Come visit me on the west coast
Come visit me on the west coast
