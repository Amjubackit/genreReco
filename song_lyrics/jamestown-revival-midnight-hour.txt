[Verse 1]
These wheels have been rolling a little too long
I forgot where I'm going, forgotten my song
[Pre-Chorus]
Heaven knows I've been trying just to get back home
Feeling low, trying to make it out on my own, woah
[Chorus]
Well, I've been burning through the midnight hour
Burning through the midnight hour
[Verse 2]
When I look out my window, I'm missing my bed
I'll be going where the wind blows, and feeling half dead
[Pre-Chorus]
Heaven knows I've been trying just to get back home
Feeling low, trying to make it out on my own, woah
[Chorus]
Well, I've been burning through the midnight hour
Burning through the midnight hour
[Post-Chorus]
'Til I get my way
And get back home to stay
I'll be burning through the midnight hour
I'll be burning through the midnight hour[Instrumental Bridge]
[Pre-Chorus]
Heaven knows I've been trying just to get back home
Feeling low, trying to make it out on my own, woah
[Chorus]
Well, I've been burning through the midnight hour
Burning through the midnight hour
[Outro]
Burning through the midnight hour
Burning through the midnight hour
