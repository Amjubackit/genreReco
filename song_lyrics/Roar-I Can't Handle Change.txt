[Intro]
Hangin' out where I don't belong
Is nothing new to me
I get tired and I get sick
And then I lose the strength to leave
[Pre-Chorus]
I can't handle change
I can't handle change
[Chorus]
Nothing I do is ever good
Nothing I do is ever good enough
Nothing I do is ever good
Nothing I do is ever good
Nothing I do is ever good enough
Nothing I do is ever good
[Bridge]
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
(I wanna go home now)
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
(I wanna go home now)
