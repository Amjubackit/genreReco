Sometimes I find it kind of hard to tell you
Even just the simple things
So let me try to lay it on you
Baby just in case you're wondering
When you get swept away
I wanna swim to your rescue
I'll paddle out into the stars for you
Drown myself in love
I drown myself in love, baby
I never worked on it much
So I'm not as in touch
As you wanted me to be
Oh, but lately I'm worryin'
To draw back the curtain
Baby just listen to me
When you get swept away
I wanna swim to your rescue
I'll paddle out into the stars for you
Drown myself in love, baby
I'ma drown myself in your love
Oh, when you get swept away
I wanna swim to your rescue
I'll paddle out into the stars for you
Drown myself in love, baby
Drownin', drownin' in your precious love
