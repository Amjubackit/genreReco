[Verse 1]
Hiding in your room but it's useless
How much longer can we really do this?
Amphetamine, stars keep you nocturnal
We make love like our youth is eternal
[Chorus]
I donâ€™t want lose that feeling
Sleeping in your arms, still dreaming
And if I, if I froze time
Could you forever, could you forever be mine? Be mine
And if I, if I froze time
Could you forever, forever be mine? Be my baby
[Post-Chorus]
Be my baby
[Verse 2]
Watching everybody getting older
Watch 'em leave New York, find their closure
Stay and kiss your neck a little harder
Chase you down to London to feel younger
[Chorus]
I don't want lose that feeling
Sleeping in your arms, still dreaming
And if I, if I froze time
Could you forever, could you forever be mine? Be mine
And if I, if I froze time
Could you forever, could you forever be mine?
Be my baby
