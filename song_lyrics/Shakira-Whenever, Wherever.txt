[Verse 1]
Lucky you were born that far away so
We could both make fun of distance
Lucky that I love a foreign land for
The lucky fact of your existence
Baby, I would climb the Andes solely
To count the freckles on your body
Never could imagine there were only
Ten million ways to love somebody
[Pre-Chorus]
Le ro lo le lo le, le ro lo le lo le
Can't you see?
I'm at your feet
[Chorus]
Whenever, wherever
We're meant to be together
I'll be there and you'll be near
And that's the deal, my dear
Thereover, hereunder
You'll never have to wonder
We can always play by ear
But that's the deal, my dear
[Verse 2]
Lucky that my lips not only mumble
They spill kisses like a fountain
Lucky that my breasts are small and humble
So you don't confuse them with mountains
Lucky I have strong legs like my mother
To run for cover when I need it
And these two eyes that for no other
The day you leave will cry a river
