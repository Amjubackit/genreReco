[Intro]
Well, in you
The good I'll do, good I'll do, oh, good I'll do
[Verse 1]
The way the grass smells at night and you got flames all in your eyes
As they reflect the sparkler and you say we'll never die
Grab me by the hands, just as callused as I am and say you're proud
[Verse 2]
Well, it's blue jeans in the driveway and you're walkin' inside sideways
The wine always affects you in beautiful, kind ways
Ask me if I'm stayin' and I'll say that I'm sleepin' on the floor
[Verse 3]
Won't you tell me that you need me 'cause lately I've been needin'
Someonе to remind me, worth more than just an еvenin'
I awoke to kitchen smoke, you dancin' like God's moved in you before
[Chorus]
Well, in you
The good I'll do, good I'll do, oh, good I'll do
Well, in you
I'm new, I'm new, oh, how I'm new
[Instrumental Break]
