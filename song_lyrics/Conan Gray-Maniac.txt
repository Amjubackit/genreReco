[Intro]
Maniac
[Verse 1]
You were with your friends, partyin'
When the alcohol kicked in
Said you wanted me dead
So you show up at my 
home
, all alone
With a shovel and a rose
Do you think I'm a joke? 'Cause
[Pre-Chorus]
People like you always want back what they can't have
But I'm past that and you know that
So you should turn back to your rat pack, tell 'em I'm trash
[Chorus]
Tell all of your friends that I'm crazy and drive you mad
That I'm such a stalker, a watcher, a psychopath
And tell them you hate me and dated me just for laughs
So why do you call me and tell me you want me back?
You maniac
[Post-Chorus]
(
Maniac, some may say
) You maniac
(
Maniac, some may say
) You maniac
(
Maniac, some may say
) You maniac
(
Maniac, some may say
)
