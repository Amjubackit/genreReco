[Verse 1]
I've got joy in the struggle
I’ve got peace in the storm
I've got strength in the battle, I don't fear anymore
I’m a child of heaven and my hope is secure
I've got joy cause I've got Jesus
[Chorus]
He gave me beauty from ashes, turn my life around
He broke my chains and now I'm dancing on solid ground
For all he has done to save me I will raise my voice
I've got Jesus so I've got joy
[Verse 2]
He bore all of my burdens yеah my debt has been paid
Then he said to my dry bonеs rise above of that grave
He has all of my worship, all the others in praise
I've got joy cause I've got Jesus
[Chorus]
He gave me beauty from ashes, turn my life around
He broke my chains and now I’m dancing on solid ground
For all he has done to save me I will raise my voice
I’ve got Jesus so I've got joy
[Verse 2]
He bore all of my burdens yeah my debt has been paid
Then he said to my dry bones rise above of that grave
He has all of my worship, all the others in praise
I’ve got joy cause I've got Jesus
[Chorus]
He gave me beauty from ashes, turn my life around
He broke my chains and now I'm dancing on solid ground
For all he has done to save me I will raise my voice
I've got Jesus so I’ve got joy
[Verse 3]
Joy like a river running through my soul
Joy all around me everywhere I go
Even in the dessert still it overflows
Oh I've got joy, yeah I've got joy wherever in me
Cause it calls my name
Every breath I breathe just to mouth amazing grace
Oh Hallelujah everything has changed
Oh I've got joy, yeah I've got joy
[Chorus]
He gave me beauty from ashes, turn my life around
He broke my chains and now I'm dancing on solid ground
For all he has done to save me I will raise my voice
I've got Jesus so I've got joy
[Verse 4]
Joy like a river running through my soul
Joy all around me everywhere I go
Even in the dessert still it overflows
I've got Jesus, so glad I have him
I've got Jesus so I've got joy
