[Refrain]
I've got a river running right into you
I've got a blood trail, red in the blue
Something you say or something you do
The taste of the divine
[Pre-Chorus]
You've got my body, flesh and bone, yeah
The sky above, the Earth below
[Chorus]
Raise me up again
Take me past the edge
I want to see the other side
See the other side
[Pre-Chorus]
You've got my body, flesh and bone
The sky above, the Earth below
[Chorus]
Raise me up again
Takе me past the edgе
I want to see the other side
Won't you show me what it's like?
Won't you show me what it's like?
