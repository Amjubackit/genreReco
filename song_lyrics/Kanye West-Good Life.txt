[Chorus: Kanye West & 
T-Pain
]
Like we always do at this time
I go for mine, I gots to shine
(
Now throw yo' hands up in the sky
)
I go go for mine, I gots to shine
(
Now throw yo' hands up in the sky
)
I'ma get on this TV, mama, I'ma
I'ma put shit down
(Ayy)

(Ayy)

 (Ayy), 
I'm good
[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Welcome to the good life, where niggas who sell D
Won't even get pulled over in they new V
The good life, let's go on a living spree
Shit, they say the best things in life are free
The good life, it feel like Atlanta
It feel like L.A., it feel like Miami
It feel like NY, summertime Chi
Ah! (
Now throw yo' hands up in the sky
)
So I roll through good
Y'all pop the trunk, I pop the hood, Ferrari
And she got the goods
And she got that ass, I got to look, sorry!
