[Chorus: YEBBA]
Roll up all my ones, take my chances
Hit another blunt, watch the embers burn away
Pour a double cup, I'm dirty dancin'
What am I runnin' from when I run so
Far away, away, away, away
Far away, away, away, away
[Verse 1: YEBBA]
I been shadowboxin' your nightmares left and right
Showin' up to the battlefield, no one to fight
Keep believin' the smoke will clear and the bombs will subside
As I lay down my pride in the things I confide in
For all these years, holdin' back my tears
Lord knows that I'm tryin', I know our love has been dyin'
I still need you here, I still need you here while I
[Chorus: YEBBA, YEBBA & A$AP Rocky]
Roll up all my ones, take my chances
Hit another blunt (Yeah-yeah, yeah), watch thе embers burn away
Pour a double cup, I'm dirty dancin'
What am I runnin' from (Yеah-yeah, yeah, yeah) when I run so
Far away, away, away, away
Far away, away, away, away
[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
I love shrooms (Yeah), I might get that tattooed (Yeah)
Might just keep it cool (Yeah) dependin' on my mood (Yeah)
The sun is risin' (Yeah) dependin' on my moon (Yeah)
Tell them boys back it up 'cause I'm finna act a fool (Gimme some room)
Yabba dabba doo, I'm with YEBBA in my coupe
With my fellas, butter-soft leathers, bumpin' Fela Kuti
Off that gin and juice, after, after that, I left the roof
After that, we hit the after-hours spot 'til the afternoon
I love shrooms
Verses where hands-on, I can't come now, I got my hands full
Why wait around on the answer? I just air it out like my hamper
Wax like the candle, back in the days in the bando (Back in the bando)
I can't fuck with that ho 'cause she canceled (She canceled)
With no tampon, walked with a man without holdin' her hand (Holdin' her hand)
Period
If I focus, I can transform into a lotus (Into a lotus)
Pull up with Rolls Royces, two sisters like two twin Holsters ghosted (Hocus pocus, magic)
[Chorus: YEBBA]
Roll up all my ones, take my chances
Hit another blunt, watch the embers burn away
Pour a double cup, I'm dirty dancin'
What am I runnin' from when I run so
Far away, away, away, away
Far away, away, away, away
