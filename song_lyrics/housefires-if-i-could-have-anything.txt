[Verse 1: Ahjah Walls]
May I be like Mary
Open to the movements of Your heart
Blessed in the keeping of Your promise
A faithful friend of God
May I love your presence, Jesus
More than any gift You've given me
More than any crown I could receive
More than all my dreams
[Chorus: Ahjah Walls]
If I could have anything
Let it be Your eyes on me
Every time I catch Your gaze
My world starts changing
I don't have that much to bring
Just a simple song to sing
If I could have anything
Let me be an offering
If I could have anything
Let it be Your eyes on me
Every time I catch Your gaze
My world starts changing
I don't have that much to bring
Just a simple song to sing
If I could have anything
Let me be an offering
[Verse 2: Blake Wiggins]
May I be like David
Unconvinced by power or by idols
Worshiping in triumph and in trial
A faithful friend of God
May I love Your spirit
More than reputation or prestige
More than what the world could think of me
'Cause Your love is all I need
[Chorus: Blake Wiggins & Ahjah Walls]
If I could have anything
Let it be your eyes on me
Every time I catch Your gaze
My world starts changing
I don't have that much to bring
Just a simple song to sing
If I could have anything
Let me be an offering
Let me be an offering
[Bridge: Blake Wiggins]
I come alive loving You
I'm overwhelmed by the way You move
My words fall short when I look at You
Oh, oh, oh
I come alive loving You
I'm overwhelmed by the way You move
My words fall short when I look at You
Oh, oh, oh
I come alive loving You
I'm overwhelmed by the way You move
My words fall short when I look at You
Oh, oh, oh
I come alive loving You
I'm overwhelmed by the way You move
My words fall short when I look at You
Oh, oh, oh
I come alive loving You
I'm overwhelmed by the way You move
My words fall short when I look at You
Oh, oh, oh
I come alive loving You
I'm overwhelmed by the way You move
My words fall short when I look at You
Oh, oh, oh
[Chorus: Blake Wiggins]
If I could have anything
Let it be Your eyes on me
Every time I catch Your gaze
My world starts changing
I don't have that much to bring
Just a simple song to sing
If I could have anything
Let me be an offering
Let me be an offering
Let me be an offering
Let me be an offering
[Outro: Ahjah Walls]
Holy and acceptable unto my King
I wanna be an offering
Holy and acceptable unto my King
I wanna be an offering
Holy and acceptable unto my King
I wanna be an offering
