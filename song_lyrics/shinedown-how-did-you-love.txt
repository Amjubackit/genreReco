[Verse 1]
You can have the sound of a thousand voices calling your name
You can have the light of the world blind you, bathe you in grace
But I don't see so easily what you hold in your hands
'Cause castles crumble, kingdoms fall and turn into sand
[Verse 2]
You can be an angel of mercy or give into hate
You can try to fight it just like every other careless mistake
How do you justify, I'm mystified by the ways of your heart
With a million lies the truth will rise to tear you apart
Whoa!
[Chorus]
No one gets out alive
Every day is do or die
The one thing you leave behind
Is how did you love? How did you love?
It's not what you believe
Those prayers will make you bleed
But while you're on your knees
How did you love? How did you love?
How did you love?
[Verse 3]
Nothing ever feels quite the same when you are what you dreamed
And you will never look at anything the same when you see what I see
How we forget ourselves, lose our way, from the cradle to the grave
You can't replicate, or duplicate, gotta find your own wayYeah!
[Chorus]
No one gets out alive
Every day is do or die
The one thing you leave behind
Is how did you love? How did you love?
It's not what you believe
Those prayers will make you bleed
But while you're on your knees
How did you love? How did you love?
How did you love?
[Bridge]
This ain't no cross to bury
We are the judge and jury
We are the judge and jury
[Chorus]
No one gets out alive
Every day is do or die
The one thing you leave behind
Is how did you love? How did you love?
It's not what you believe
Those prayers will make you bleed
But while you're on your knees
How did you love? How did you love?How did you love?
[Bridge]
This ain't no cross to bury
We are the judge and jury
This ain't no cross to bury
We are the judge and jury
[Outro]
How did you love? How did you love?
How did you love? How did you love?
How did you love? How did you love?
How did you love? How did you love?
