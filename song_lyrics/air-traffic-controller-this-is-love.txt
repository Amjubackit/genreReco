[Verse 1]
You're no good, you're no good
You could kill me and you should
I'm an idiot for thinking
This was anything but blood
On the wall, on the couch
On the corner of my mouth
You must like being the victim
You've done nothing to get out
Of this pattern of pain
Washed away by the rain
You'll forgive me if I promise
And do nothing but the same
This is life until death
Could be my last dying breath
But this is love, love, shut up, this is love
[Hook]
Forget everything you used to know
I think you better tell your friends to go
Stick around 'cause I'm about to show you
The beginning is the end
[Verse 2]
Yeah, I know wrong, I know right
But I just love to pick a fight
I can sleep with one eye open
If there's any sleep at night
I got my knife, got my gun
Let's see how fast you can run
You might think that you can hurt me
But the damage has been done
It's pathetic, I know
A jealous fool who won't let go
If I was sorry for my actions
Would I ever stoop so low?
Got no reason to live
And I've got nothing left to give you
But my love, love, fuck it, this is love
[Hook]
Forget everything you used to know
I think you better tell your friends to go
Stick around 'cause I'm about to show you
The beginning is the end
[Verse 3]
Oh, I was hit as a kid
I was good but then I quit
Everyone that tried to fix me
Knows that I can't change a bit
I've got no shame, got no pride
Only skeletons to hide
And if you try to talk to someone
Well, then someone has to die
Once you chase me down the hole
Yeah, once you think you're in control
You'll believe that we are partners
And you're feeling comfortable
Oh, then the darkness rolls in
And you'll forget who I have been
But you'll love, love, love it, this is love
[Hook]
Forget everything you used to know
I think you better tell your friends to go
Stick around 'cause I'm about to show you
The beginning is the end
This ain't the love that your grandparents had
This kind of love will only make you mad, honey
It hurts at first but it ain't that bad
You gotta wonder what it meant
[Outro]
This is love
This is love
This is love
This is love
This is love
This is love
This is love
This is love
