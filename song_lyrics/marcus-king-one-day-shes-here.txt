[Verse 1]
Pretty little girl in a Coupe de Ville
Saw her disappear up across the hill
One day here, now the next, she's gone
Didn't even get to hear me sing my song
[Verse 2]
Had her for a minute but she slipped away
Sadder than a wedding on a rainy day
One day here and the next you gone
Stayed just long enough to turn me on
[Chorus]
She disappears just like the dawn
One day she's here, the next, she's gone
[Verse 3]
Probably never find another one like her
Now the only thing that I know for sure
One day here and the next, she gone
She the kind that likes to keep moving on
[Chorus]
She disappears just like the dawn
One day she's here, the next, she's gone
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Chorus]
She disappears just like the dawn
One day she's here, the next, she's gone
She disappears just like the dawn
One day she's here, the next, she's gone
[Outro]
One day she's here, then the next, she's gone
One day she's here, then the next, she's gone (One day she's here, then the next, she's gone)
One day she's here, then the next, she's gone (One day she's here, then the next, she's gone)
