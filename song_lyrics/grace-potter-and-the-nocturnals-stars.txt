[Verse 1]
I lit a fire with the love you left behind
And it burned wild and crept up the mountainside
I followed your ashes into outer space
I can't look out the window, I can't look at this place
[Chorus]
I can't look at the stars
They make me wonder where you are
Stars, up on Heaven's boulevard
And if I know you at all, I know you've gone too far
So I, I can't look at the stars
[Verse 2]
All those times we looked up at the sky
Looking out so far, we felt like we could fly
And now I'm all alone in the dark of night
The moon is shining, but I can't see the light
[Chorus]
And I can't look at the stars
They make me wonder where you are
Stars, up on Heaven's boulevard
And if I know you at all, I know you've gone too far
So I, I can't look at the stars[Instrumental Bridge]
[Chorus]
Stars
Stars, they make me wonder where you are
Stars, up on Heaven's boulevard
And if I know you at all, I know you've gone too far
So I can't look at the stars
