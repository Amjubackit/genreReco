[Intro: James Fortune]
Blessings overflow, You've unchained my soul
I keep on thanking You
[Verse 1: James Fortune]
Favor
Chains were broken from my slaver
Favor (Yeah, yeah), Glory
The battles already won for me (For me), glory (Ooh)
Not by sight but by faith
Weapons may form against me (Yeah, yeah)
Your sacrifice sealed my fate
Ain't no chain my God can't break (Nah-nah-nah-nah)
[Chorus: James Fortune]
Blessings overflow, You've unchained my soul (Ooh-ah)
Whenever I feel lonely, that’s impossible (Oh)
When they drag me low, You cut loose my ropes (Ah, yeah)
It’s impossible to thank You for my overflow (Ooh)
[Post-Chorus: James Fortune]
(La-la, la, la, la) I keep on thanking You (Ah, yeah)
(La-la, la, la, la) You keep on coming through (Ah, yеah, ooh)
(La-la, la, la, la) I keep on thanking You
(La-la, la, la, la) You keep on coming through (Ah, yeah, ooh)
[Verse 2: James Fortune]
You're my lighthouse in thе storm
Guide me safely through the sea
As I travel through the valley
I know You're right here with me (With me)
Whenever I'm lost, I find my way
You always make a way for me
And though I'm undeserving
Still, You set a plate for me
There don' been times when I lost my way (Ah)
But You still came back for me
I was tryna do everything my way
You still made a way for me
[Chorus: James Fortune]
Blessings overflow, You've unchained my soul
And if ever I feel lonely, that's impossible (Impossible)
When they drag me low, You cut loose my ropes (La-la, yeah, my ropes)
It's impossible to thank You for my overflow (Ooh)
[Post-Chorus: James Fortune]
(La-la, la, la, la) I keep on thanking You
(La-la, la, la, la) You keep on coming through (Ah, yeah, ooh)
(La-la, la, la, la) I keep on thanking You (Hey)
(La-la, la, la, la) You keep on coming through (Ah, yeah)
[Verse 3: Waka Flocka Flame]
I was goin' hard in the paint (Yah) 'fore a breakthrough (Man)
I lost brothers, but I never lost You (You don't)
Lost but I’m found now (Yah, free squad), the wild boy calmed down
You know I owe it all to You (Hey)
Jesus wept, mama cried too (Mama)
I live to tell the stories how You (You know)
Went through the fire, left with the flame (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Carryin' the torch, Waka Flocka Flame
[Bridge: Waka Flocka Flame]
Squad, squad, squad, squad
Squad, squad, squad, squad (Yeah, yo)
[Chorus: James Fortune, Waka Flocka Flame]
Blessings overflow, you've unchained my soul
And if ever I feel lonely, that's impossible
When they drag me low, You cut loose my ropes (Ah, yeah)
It's impossible to thank You for my overflow (Squad, squad)
[Post-Chorus: James Fortune]
(La-la, la, la, la) I keep on thanking You
(La-la, la, la, la)You keep on coming through (Ah, yeah)
(La-la, la, la, la) I keep on thanking You (Ah, yeah)
(La-la, la, la, la) You keep on coming through (Ah, yeah, ooh)
[Outro: James Fortune]
Blessings overflow, You've unchained my soul (Uh)
I keep on thanking You (Oh, yup)
When they drag me low, You cut loose my ropes (When they drag me low)
It's impossible to thank You for my overflow
