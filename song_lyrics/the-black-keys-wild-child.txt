[Verse 1]
I'm just a stranger
With a twisted smile and a wandering eye
Your heart is in danger
Come close now, let me tell you a lie
[Chorus]
Wild child
You got me runnin' through the turnstile
Baby girl, we better make it worthwhile
You're gonna get my love today, yeah
[Verse 2]
You are a sweet dream
With a tender heart and a beautiful smile
But things aren't what they seem
So I'll let you go and dream for a while
[Chorus]
Wild child
You got me coming outta exile
Baby girl, you know I'm liking your style
You're gonna get my love today, yeah
[Guitar Solo]
