[Verse 1]
Walking through
A barren land
I call on Your name
For a helping hand
[Pre-Chorus]
You're closer than a brother
God, Your love is so much better
Than anything
I could find on my own
[Chorus]
Jesus, Your name is power
Breath and living water
Your Spirit guides me
To the heart of the Father
Your name is power
Breath and living water
Your Spirit guides me
To the heart of the Father
[Post-Chorus]
Sing praise
We sing praise
God, we sing praise
We sing praise[Verse 2]
I walk with You
Though the seasons change
Your Word stays true
This hope won't put me to shame
[Pre-Chorus]
You're closer than a brother
God, Your love is so much better
Than anything
I could find on my own
[Chorus]
Jesus, Your name is power
Breath and living water
Your Spirit guides me
To the heart of the Father
Your name is power
Breath and living water
Your Spirit guides me
To the heart of the Father
[Bridge]
Sing praise
We sing praise
God, we sing praise
We sing praise
God, we sing praise
We sing praise
God, we sing praise
We sing praise[Chorus]
Jesus, Your name is power
Breath and living water
Your Spirit guides me
To the heart of the Father
Your name is power
Breath and living water
Your Spirit guides me
To the heart of the Father
[Outro]
Sing praise
We sing praise
God, we sing praise
We sing praise
