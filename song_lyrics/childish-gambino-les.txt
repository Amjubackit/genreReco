[Chorus]
Baby, you're the baddest
Baby, you're the baddest girl, and, uh
Nobody else matters
Nobody else matters girl, and, uh
We're kissing in the bathroom
We're kissing in the bathroom girl, and, uh
I hope nobody catch us
But I kinda hope they catch us, anyway
[Verse 1]
A New York nine's an everywhere else six
Timewise, the opposite goes for chicks
I'm in a taxi, texting with my best friend
He's sleeping with this girl that he met up on the West End
He's lucky, she's a career woman, no kids
Most girls see the clothes and try and gold dig
Most hoes poke holes in Trojans
Most people don't fuck and hit the lotto but my folks did
I'm a mess
That don't rhyme with shit, it's just true
Don't bring your girlfriend here, it's just you
When I'm depressed you're someone I run to
But, I guess meet me at Pianos
They cross-fadin' off of Nanos
Ugh, on that hipster shit
And you's a hipster, bitch
Yo, but not in the lame way
Like, you ain't livin' out in BK
Like, you ain't workin' on a screenplay
Like, your baby daddy ain't a DJ
Like, she listenin' to old Freeway
'Cause everybody listens to Biggie, but she different
Right, thatâ€™s why your friends need wristbands?
Fuck you
Can I have this dance?
