[Intro]
Ooh
[Verse 1]
Even when I cannot see
Your Spirit is leading me
Your voice quiets my fears
Your hand wipes every tear
[Chorus]
So I'll go anywhere You take me (Yeah)
'Cause I know Your love will sustain me
And I don't care if I look crazy, no (Oh)
So I'll go anywhere You take me, uh-uh
[Post-Chorus]
So I'll go, I'll go, uh, uh
So I'll go, I'll go
[Verse 2]
All my hope is in You
When darkness surrounds me, You surround me, too
All my hope's in You
When darkness surrounds me, You surround me, too
[Chorus]
So I'll go anywhere You take me (Yeah)
'Cause I know Your love will sustain me
And I don't care if I look crazy, no (Oh)
So I'll go anywhere You take me, uh-uh
