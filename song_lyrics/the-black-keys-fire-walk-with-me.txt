[Verse 1]
Fire walk with me
I'm tired as I can be
Bruised, my weary soul
Flames now take control
[Verse 2]
Fire light the way
Burn the night to day
Bathe in afterglow
Everywhere I go
[Chorus]
Roll on fire
Higher and higher
Living in a fever dream
Feeling that fire walk with me
[Verse 3]
Fire in the sky
Burning ball of light
The heavens are ablaze
Flames are like a maze
[Chorus]
Roll on fire
Higher and higher
Living in a fever dream
Feeling that fire walk with me[Outro]
Roll on fire
Higher and higher
Living in a fever dream
Feeling that fire walk
Burning up every thought
Feeling that fire walk with me
