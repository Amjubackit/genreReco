[Verse 1]
I remember one night in September
Lying on our backs under the moon
You told me that nothing lasts forever
But I was too busy falling for you
[Pre-Chorus]
But I should have listened
'Cause now I'm here missing you
Wishing that you were here
[Chorus]
Oh woah, Starbright, can you shine a light?
I need you by my side
It's dark out there tonight
Oh woah, Starbright, someday, somewhere far
When we're not worlds apart
I'll hold you in my arms
But until I can see you again, I'm wishing on stars
[Drop]
[Verse 2]
I can blame the whole thing on bad timing
Turn back all the clocks to yesteryear
I can try to find the silver lining
But all thе colors seem so dull without you near
(Without you near)[Pre-Chorus]
But I should have listеned
'Cause now I'm here missing you
Wishing that you were here
[Chorus]
Oh woah, Starbright, can you shine a light?
I need you by my side
It's dark out there tonight
Oh woah, Starbright, someday, somewhere far
When we're not worlds apart
I'll hold you in my arms
But until I can see you again, I'm wishing on stars
[Drop]
(Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh, ooh)
