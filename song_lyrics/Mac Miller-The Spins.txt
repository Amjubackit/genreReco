[Intro: Mac Miller]
Dope shit like that, Jerm
Oh, hi
Welcome back to 
K.I.D.S.
, um
Follow your dreams
Yeah
[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Wanna get a mansion, a jacuzzi
A theater to watch my movies
Couple whips and lots of fancy things
The kids they call the Goonies
I see the future, crystal ball
Mirror mirror hangin' on the wall
Who the flyest white boy of them all?
Got your girlfriend screenin' all the calls
She bubblin', we fuckin', then you cuddlin'
Like, baby, where the fuck you been?
Don't wanna tell you she in love with him
So, so we ain't sayin' nothin'
You could probably tell she bluffin'
'Cause she kiss you with the mouth
She gave me head with my concussion
Yeah, she blushin', all red
Wanna rush and go to bed
You interrogate that bitch like you the feds
So she says she in love with a rockstar, rockstar
Wanna smoke my weed, so she asks me where the tops are, tops are
