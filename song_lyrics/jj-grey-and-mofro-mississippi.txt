Mississippi
Well I dearly love my home but ⁄
She never looked so good to me ⁄
Blue skies and dragonflies ⁄
Muddy creek Lord set me free ⁄
Good things are going on ⁄ there in Mississippi ⁄
She made me feel good ⁄
There in Mississippi ⁄
Folks smiling and saying hey ⁄
In my car as I'm passing by ⁄
And I can smell those barbeque grills ⁄
Firing on the fourth of July ⁄
Good things are going on ⁄
There in Mississippi ⁄
She made me feel good ⁄
There in Mississippi ⁄
⁄ Good things are going on ⁄
There in Mississippi ⁄
She made me feel good ⁄
There in Mississippi ⁄
Everybody moving everybody grooving ⁄
Everybody letting it all get loose ⁄
There in Mississippi
