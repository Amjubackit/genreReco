[Intro]
(You are stellar)
[Verse 1]
Meet me in outer space
We could spend the night, watch the earth come up
I've grown tired of that place, won't you come with me?
We could start again
[Chorus]
How do you do it?
Make me feel like I do
How do you do it?
It's better than I ever knew, huh
[Verse 2]
Meet me in outer space
I will hold you close if you're afraid of heights
I need you to see this place, it might be the only way
That I can show you how it feels to be inside of you
[Chorus]
How do you do it?
Make me feel like I do
How do you do it?
It's better than I ever knew, uh
How do you do it?
Make me feel like I do
[Bridge]
I do, oh, uhuhuhuh
(You are stellar)
(You are stellar)
[Chorus]
How do you do it?
Make me feel like I do
How do you do it?
It's better than I ever knew, uh
How do you do it?
Make me feel like I do
How do you do it?
Make me feel like I do
Yeah
