Well, you get down the fiddle and you get down the bow
Kick off your shoes and you throw 'em on the floor
Dance in the kitchen till the mornin' light
Louisiana Saturday night
A-waiting in the front yard sitting on a log
A single shot rifle and a one eyed dog
Yonder come my kinfolk, in the moonlight
Louisiana Saturday night
Well, you get down the fiddle and you get down the bow
Kick off your shoes and you throw 'em on the floor
Dance in the kitchen till the mornin' light
Louisiana Saturday night
My brother Bill and my other brother Jack
Belly full of beer and a possum in a sack
Fifteen kids in the front porch light
Louisana Saturday night
When your kinfolk leave and the kids get fed
Me and my woman gonna slip off to bed
Have a little fun when we turn out the lights
Louisiana Saturday night
Well, you get down the fiddle and you get down the bow
Kick off your shoes and you throw 'em on the floor
Dance in the kitchen till the mornin' light
Louisiana Saturday night
Yeah, you get down the fiddle and you get down the bow
Kick off your shoes and you throw 'em on the floor
Dance in the kitchen till the mornin' light
Louisiana Saturday night
Get down the fiddle and you get down the bow
Kick off your shoes and you throw 'em on the floor
Dance in the kitchen till the mornin' light
Louisiana Saturday night
