[Intro]
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
[Verse 1: Joe L Barnes]
In the beginning, You sent the earth spinning
Fashioned us from the dust
And since our existence, there's only been one mission
For You to commune with us
And then came the garden, we became the fallen
Sin made us lose our way
Oh, but the love that's too good to give up
Set a course for amazing grace
[Chorus: Joe L Barnes]
This is the Gospel, this is the Good News
Tell everybody how He saved you
This is the Gospel, come hear the Good News
Tell everybody, there's a God that loves you
[Post-Chorus: Joe L Barnes]
Oh, how He loves you
There's a God that loves you
Oh, how He loves you
There's a God that loves you
