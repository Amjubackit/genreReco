[Chorus]
You love me especially different every time
You keep me on my feet, happily excited
By your cologne, your hands
Your smile, your intelligence
You woo me, you court me
You tease me, you please me
You school me, give me some things to think about
Ignite me, 
you invite me
You co-write me, you love me, you like me
You incite me to chorus, ooh
Ooh ooooh ooooh
[Chorus]
You love me (love me) especially (especially) different every time
You keep me (keep me) on my feet (on my feet), happily excited
By your cologne, and your hands
Your smile, your intelligence
You woo me, you court me
You tease me, you please me
You school me, give me things to think about
Invite me, you ignite me
Co-write me, you love me, you like me
Incite me to chorus
La, la, la
Da, da, da
Da, da, da
Do, do, do
