[Verse 1]
Looking out on the morning rain
I used to feel so uninspired
And when I knew I had to face another day
Lord, it made me feel so tired
[Pre-Chorus]
Before the day I met you, life was so unkind
But you're the key to my peace of mind
[Chorus]
'Cause you make me feel, you make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman (
Woman
)
[Verse 2]
When my soul was in the lost and found
You came along to claim it
I didn't know just what was wrong with me
'Til your kiss helped me name it
[Pre-Chorus]
Now I'm no longer doubtful of what I'm living for
And if I make you happy, I don't need to do more
[Chorus]
'Cause you make me feel, you make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman (
Woman
)
