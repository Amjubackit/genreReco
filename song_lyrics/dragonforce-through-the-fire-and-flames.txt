[Instrumental Intro]
[Verse 1]
On a cold winter morning
In the time before the light
In flames of Death's eternal reign
We ride towards the fight
When the darkness has fallen down
And the times are tough, alright
The sound of evil laughter falls
Around the world tonight
Fighting hard, fighting on for the steel
Through the wastelands evermore
The scattered souls will feel the hell
Bodies wasted on the shores
On the blackest plains in hell's domain
We watch them as they go
In fire and pain, now once again we know
[Pre-Chorus 1]
So now, we fly ever free, we're free before the thunderstorm
On towards the wilderness, our quest carries on
Far beyond the sundown, far beyond the moonlight
Deep inside our hearts and all our souls
[Chorus]
So far away, we wait for the day
For the lives, all so wasted and gone
We feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days
Through the fire and the flames, we carry on!
