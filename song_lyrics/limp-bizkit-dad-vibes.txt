[Verse 1]
Check out your dad with the swag on the floor
Mama gon' brag when I walk in the door
Y'all ain't ever seen a guerrilla in the mist
Walk the line so fine with a blindfold (Uh)
Keep in mind though
Hot dad riding in on a rhino
Got the roll-under-rap with the dad vibes
Now everybody bounce with the franchise (C'mon)
[Chorus]
Can't live with 'em
, can't live without 'em
New kid back on the block with a R.I.P.
 
Dad got the sag in the back with a drip
Come and get a sip, la-di-da
Can't live with 'em, can't live without 'em
New kid back on the block with a R.I.P.
 
Dad got the sag in the back with a drip
Come and get a sip, la-di-da
[Verse 2]
Damn, this dad like a rivеr
Flow so cold, need ice to deliver
Drop so hard likе a rock (Like a rock), dad don't stop (Don't stop)
So damn clean, he a mop (Uh, sugar)
Sugar cane (Cane), down with the mane (Mane)
Dad so sweet that his nickname candy
Y'all been gone for a minute
 (Yup)
Dad vibe bounce to the finish, I can get with that[Chorus]
Can't live with 'em
, can't live without 'em
New kid back on the block with a R.I.P.
 
Dad got the sag in the back with a drip
Come and get a sip, la-di-da
Can't live with 'em, can't live without 'em
New kid back on the block with a R.I.P.
 
Dad got the sag in the back with a drip
Come and get a sip, la-di-da
[Bridge]
Na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na
Na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na, la-di-da
Na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na
Na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na, now shut up, here we go again
[Chorus]
Can't live with 'em
, can't live without 'em
New kid back on the block with a R.I.P.
 
Dad got the sag in the back with a drip
Come and get a sip, la-di-da
Can't live with 'em, can't live without 'em
New kid back on the block with a R.I.P.
 
Dad got the sag in the back with a drip
Come and get a sip, la-di-da
