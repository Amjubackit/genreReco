[Verse 1]
To my mother, to my father
It's your son, or it's your daughter
Are my screams loud enough for
You to hear me? Should I turn this up for you?
[Chorus]
I sit here, locked inside my head
Remembering everything you said
The silence gets us nowhere
Gets us nowhere way too fast
[Verse 2]
The silence is what kills me
I need someone here to help me
But you don't know how to listen
And let me make my decisions
[Chorus]
I sit here, locked inside my head
Remembering everything you said
The silence gets us nowhere
Gets us nowhere way too fast
[Verse 3]
All your insults and your curses
Make me feel like I'm not a person
And I feel like I am nothing
But you made me, so do something!
'Cause I'm fucked up, because you all
Need attention, attention you couldn't give![Chorus]
'Cause I sit here, locked inside my head
Remembering everything you said
The silence gets us nowhere
Gets us nowhere way too fast
I sit here, locked inside my head
Remembering everything you said!
The silence gets us nowhere
Gets us nowhere way too fast
