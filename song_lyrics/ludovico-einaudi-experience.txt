You know
The fire is running low
Can you feel the flame her fading glow
You know
We are slowing down
I can hear your footsteps drowning up
We're burning down
We're burning down
We're the ashes on the ground
We're burning down
We're burning down
We're falling underground
You are
You singing now a song
But you heard it somewhere else I know
We are
We're trying to belong
Pick up the pieces left of us
We're burning down
We're burning down
We're the ashes on the ground
We're burning down
We're burning down
We're falling underground
