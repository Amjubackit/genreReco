[Verse 1]
I was a bad reputation
With an attitude to match
Hellbent on goin' nowhere
And gettin' there lightnin' fast
Twenty-one and lookin' thirty
But actin' half my age
Bound to hit a wall
Before I ever hit the brakes
[Chorus]
Codeine, it got Elvis
Whiskey, it got Hank
I always thought somethin' like that
Might send me on my way
But you took hold of me
Like only a woman can
And gave one good reason to live
To a set-on-dyin' man
[Verse 2]
When a Friday meets a Sunday
You can't help but see the light
I never believed in angels
'Til one believed in me that night
Turned my off-track into a straight line
Before I turned into a headline
[Chorus]
Like, Codeine, it got Elvis
Whiskey, it got Hank
I always thought somethin' like that
Might send me on my way
But you took hold of me
Like only a woman can
And gave one good reason to live
To a set-on-dyin' man
[Bridge]
Woah-oh
Turned a one-way man one-eighty
Settled down a given-upper
Yeah, you changed a "You can't change me"
So, the world won't see another
[Chorus]
Codeine, it got Elvis
Whiskey, it got Hank
I always thought somethin' like that
Might send me on my way
But you took hold of me
Like only a woman can
And gave one good reason to live
To a set-on-dyin' man
[Outro]
A set-on-dyin' man
