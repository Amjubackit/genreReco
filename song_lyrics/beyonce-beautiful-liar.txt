[Intro: Beyoncé]
Ay, ay
Ay (Nobody likes being played)
[Refrain: Beyoncé]
(Oh) Beyoncé, Beyoncé
(Oh) Shakira, Shakira (Hey)
[Verse 1: Beyoncé, 
Shakira
]
He said I'm worth it
His one desire
I know things about him that you wouldn't wanna read about
He kissed me, his one and only (Yes)
Beautiful liar
Tell me how you tolerate the things I just found out about
[Pre-Chorus: Shakira, 
Beyoncé
]
You never know
Why are we the ones who suffer?
I have to let go
He won't be the one to cry
[Chorus: Beyoncé, 
Shakira
, 
Both
]
(Ay) Let's not kill the karma
(Ay) Let's not start a fight
(Ay) It's not worth the drama
For a beautiful liar
(Oh) 
Can't we laugh about it?
 (Ha, ha, ha!)
(Oh) 
It's not worth our time
(Oh) 
We can live without him
Just a beautiful liar[Verse 2: Shakira, 
Beyoncé
]
I trusted him, but when I followed you
I saw you together
I didn't know about you then 'till I saw you with him again
I walked in on your love scene
Slow dancing
You stole everything, how can you say I did you wrong? Yeah
[Pre-Chorus: Shakira, 
Beyoncé
]
We'll never know
When the pain and heartbreak's over
I have to let go
The innocence is gone
[Chorus: Beyoncé, 
Shakira
, 
Both
]
(Ay) Let's not kill the karma
(Ay) Let's not start a fight
(Ay) It's not worth the drama
For a beautiful liar
(Oh) 
Can't we laugh about it?
 (Ha, ha, ha)
(Oh) 
It's not worth our time
(Oh) 
We can live without him
Just a beautiful liar
[Bridge: Shakira, 
Beyoncé
, 
Both
]
Tell me how to forgive you (
Ooh
)
When it's me who's ashamed (
Oh
)
And I wish could free you
Of the hurt and the pain
But the answer is simple
He's the one to blame
 (
Hey
)[Instrumental Break]

(Ay) Let's not kill the karma
(Ay) Let's not start a fight
(Ay) It's not worth the drama
For a beautiful liar

Can't we laugh about it?

(Oh) 
It's not worth our time
(Oh) 
We can live without him
