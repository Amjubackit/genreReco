[Verse 1]
Able, You're more than able
Ain't no problem that's too hard
For a strong and mighty God
Yes, You are able
You're more than able
Time and time again You prove
I can always count on You
Yes, You are able (Ah), You are (Able)
Mm, ain't no problem that's too hard (Ooh)
For a strong and mighty God
Oh, You are able
You're so much more than able (Ayy)
Time and time again You prove
I can always count on You
[Verse 2]
You are faithful (Faithful, yeah), more than faithful (Ooh)
A sweeter love that never stops
It will finish what it starts (Mm)
You are faithful, more than faithful
And when I don't understand
I still leave it in Your hands
(Help mе say) Faithful (Oh), faithful
(Yeah, You come with a) Sweeter lovе that never stops (Mm)
It will finish what it starts (I'm so glad You are)
Faithful (Over and over again, You are), faithful (Oh)
And when I don't understand, no (I don't understand)
I still leave it in Your hands
