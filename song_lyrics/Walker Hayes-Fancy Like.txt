[Verse 1]
Ayy
My girl is bangin', she's so low maintenance
Don't need no champagne-poppin' entertainment
Take her to Wendy's, can't keep her off me
She wanna dip me like them fries in her Frosty
[Pre-Chorus]
But every now and then, when I get paid
I gotta spoil my baby with an upgrade 
(Yeah)
Ayy, ayy, ayy
[Chorus]
Yeah, we fancy like Applebee's on a date night
Got some Bourbon Street steak with the Oreo shake
Get some whipped cream on the top, too
Two straws, one check, girl, I got you
Bougie like Natty in the styrofoam
Squeaky-squeakin' in the truck bed all the way home
With some Alabama-jamma, she my Dixieland delight (Hey)
That's how we do, how we do, fancy like
[Post-Chorus]
Ooh
Fancy like, ooh
Fancy like, ooh
Fancy like, ooh
