[Verse 1]
Here we go again
She's back in town again
I'll take her back again
One more time
Here we go again
The phone will ring again
I'll be her fool again
One more time
[Bridge]
I've been there before
And I'll try it again
But any fool knows that there's no way to win
[Verse 2]
Here we go again
She'll break my heart again
I'll play the part again
One more time
[Instrumental Break]
[Outro]
Here we go again
She'll break my heart again
I'll play the part again
One more time
I'll take her back again
One more time
