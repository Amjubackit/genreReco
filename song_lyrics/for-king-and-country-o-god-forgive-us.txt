[Verse 1]
We've prayed the prayer with no reply
Words float off into the night
Couldn't cut our doubt with the sharpest knife
O, O God forgive us
Silence isn't comfortable
We want drive through peace and instant hope
Our shallow faith it has left us broke
O, O God forgive us
O, O God forgive us
[Chorus]
A slave to our uncertainty
Help us with our unbelief
O, O God forgive us
[Verse 2]
Young and old, black and white
We're rich and poor, there's no divide
Hear the mighty, hear the powerless, singing
O, O God forgive us
O, O God forgive us
[Chorus]
A slave to our uncertainty
Help us with our unbelief
O, O God forgive us[Bridge]
With our white flag sailing in the night
Eyes pointed to the sky
Hands up and open wide, open wide
With our white flag sailing in the night
Eyes pointed to the sky
Hands up and open wide, open wide
With our white flag sailing in the night
Eyes pointed to the sky
Hands up and open wide, open wide
With our white flag sailing in the night
Eyes pointed to the sky
Hands up and open wide, open wide
[Chorus]
O, O God forgive us
A slave to our uncertainty
Help us with our unbelief
O, O God forgive us
[Outro]
Run wild. To risk everything. To hold nothing back. To lay it all on the line: your reputation, your success, your comfort. It's that moment when fear is overcome by faith. Live free. It's not the liberty to do whatever you want whenever and wherever you want, but rather it's living in accordance with the author of humanity and finding freedom by connecting with the creator who conceived you. Let the light flood into your eyes for the first time. Feeling the blood course through your veins, finding the truest version of yourself by knowing the one who knows you even better than you know yourself. Love strong. Because you were first loved. Because without love we all perish. Because the earth and the stars can and will pass away, but love, love will always remain
