[Verse 1]
I'm drunk off your kiss
For another night in a row
This is becoming too routine for me
But I didn't mean to lead you on
And it's alright to pretend
That we still talk
It's just for show, isn't it?
It's my fault that it fell apart
[Pre-Chorus]
Just maybe you need this
And I didn't mean to
Lead you on
[Chorus]
You were everything I wanted
But I just can't finish what I've started
There's no room left here on my back
It was damaged long ago
Though you swear that you are true
I'd still pick my friends over you
[Post-Chorus]
My friends over you
