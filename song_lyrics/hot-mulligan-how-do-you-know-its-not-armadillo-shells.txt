[Verse 1]
So scared that you don't want me here
In the corner of the living room
Reading subtitles 'cause I can't hear
The show you put on for noise
While you're laughing in the kitchen pouring drinks over ice
And I am not the type to go out every night
'Cause I just need some time
To know what's wrong in my head
[Chorus]
Pulling out the pages that I wrote for you
Hoping you don't think that I'm dependent 'cause I know the truth
Might be too much, I'm not enough
I'm always disappointed in the things I write
Even when I speak it seems the words'll never come out right
Coping alone, just bring me home
[Verse 2]
And it's happened again, another friend said "marry me"
While unknowingly signing away the life he wanted
I'm glad, but none of our parents stayed together
I hate to be a bummer but I'm three more beers from calling a cab
So I can sleep to shake this dread
I won't wake up unless you ask if I am okay[Chorus]
Pulling out the pages that I wrote for you
Hoping you don't think that I'm dependent 'cause I know the truth
Might be too much, I'm not enough
I'm always disappointed in the things I write
Even when I speak it seems the words'll never come out right
Coping alone, just bring me home
Just bring
[Bridge]
Just bring me home
Just bring me home
I don't wanna talk on the balcony
Just wanna drink 'til I kill what's gotten into me
Just bring me home
Just bring me home
Just bring, just bring, just bring me home
[Outro]
And I just need some time to know what's wrong in my head
