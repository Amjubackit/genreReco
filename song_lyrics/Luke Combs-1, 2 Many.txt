[Verse 1: Luke Combs]
Well I got a call from Rowdy ‘round six o'clock
Sayin' he caught a hankerin’ for a honky tonk
Wants an ice cold beer and a country song
But he didn't want to stay out all night long
Well I ain't the kind to let a buddy drink alone
But I can't turn it off once I turn it on
[Chorus: Luke Combs]
There's no stoppin' me once I get goin'
Put a can in my hand man, I'm wide ass open
The tick-tock of that clock is like a time bomb
By half past 10 I'm half past tipsy
And quarter to 12, man I done had plenty
The countdowns on when the first beer hits me
5-4-3-2-1 too many
[Verse 2: Luke Combs]
After five diet Millers I was feelin' loose
Singin' karaoke to a TL tune
When a pretty little thing shot me a wink
She said, "Hey cowboy, could you buy us a drink?"
Well hey, baby doll, I will if you want
But I can't turn it off once I turn it on
[Chorus: Luke Combs]
There's no stoppin' me once I get goin'
Put a can in my hand man, I'm wide ass open
The tick-tock of that clock is like a time bomb
By half past 10 I'm half past tipsy
And quarter to 12, man I done had plenty
The countdowns on when the first beer hits me
5-4-3-2-1 too many
