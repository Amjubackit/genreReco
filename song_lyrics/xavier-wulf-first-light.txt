[Verse]
4 A.M., I'm out here smoking on a Nudy
I see the sunrise, now it’s time to keep it moving
You niggas ain't a threat, who you thought you was behoovin
I'm riding through the county, only bumping old music
I pulled up on my momma just to see what they was doing
I’m headed out to eat, I just ate but I'm hungry
I ain't finna play with none of you niggas or your homies
He said he wouldn't run, found out that was bologna
Bitch!
Yeah nigga, hell yeah, send him off a cliff
She said I drove her crazy, told that bitch to get a grip
I got the F80 just to add it to the whips
I pull up to the car meet smoking on a fifth
If I let you slide then consider that a gift
If I'm fucking with her, let her book a lil trip
I don't remember nun, but I bet I won't forget
If he run up on me, let the old boat rip
They thought I was sketchy, why his hand on his hip?
Stage 2 tuned, hear the pop when I dip
Imma raise a cup for the hood and take a sip
Imma have a fucking blast, crash the event
Imma tell it to the class, he ain't really rich
Piccadilly eating ass niggas talking shit
They was in the club smoking only one skimp
When I get a steak I need a side of grilled shrimp
Or go get the crab leg, butter up the bitch
I ain’t even flex, I won’t butter up the bitch
She wanna pull up just cause of the accent
I don't give a fuck, don’t give me your two cents
Imma give it to a junkie like he needed it
She looked up to me and said "You so conceited-ed"
He said he was coming but I'm not believing it...
YOU BITCH!
