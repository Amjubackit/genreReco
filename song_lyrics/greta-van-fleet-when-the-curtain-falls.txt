[Intro]
(One, two, three, four)
[Verse 1]
Well, you're so pretty and I love you so
You know I'm your biggest fan
I saw your picture and it's the best
The finest in the land
[Pre-Chorus]
Camera, lights, and action
Yeah, the words you know so well
You're in and out of fashion
In Hollywood of Hell
[Chorus]
When the curtain falls
Walk the hollow halls, babe
Once a valley doll
Now you're not at all, no
[Verse 2]
Well, I love you in that movie show
Can I have your autograph?
It's so funny you have such charm
The whole thing made me laugh
[Pre-Chorus]
Obetrol and cocktails
You're counting all your rings
They all said they loved you
Didn't they, darling?
Well, they've taken all your things
[Chorus]
When the curtain falls
Walk the hollow halls, babe
Once a valley doll
Now you're not at all, no
[Bridge]
Well, listen, darling
It's been real swell
What can I say?
You've got it all
You're a one woman show
But I'm not gonna lie to you
You could use a little work
Well, at your age
Well
[Guitar Solo]
What you got, baby?
[Chorus]
When the curtain falls
Walk the hollow halls, babe
Once a valley doll
Now you're not at all
[Outro]
Goodbye, baby
Goodbye
