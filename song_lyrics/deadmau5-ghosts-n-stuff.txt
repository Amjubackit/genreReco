[Verse 1: Rob Swire]
It's been so long, I've been out of my body with you
I feel alone, feel at home, feel like nothin' is true
She took me to a place where my senses gave way
Turnin' 'round, shuttin' down 
what the people say
Climbin' up, killin' time, 
let 'em give you some
Take my hand and let it come, let it come, let it
[Pre-Chorus: Rob Swire]
Take it back where she knows that you're doin' it right
'Cause everybody else knows what they're takin' tonight
[Chorus: Rob Swire]
But I just wanna play it right
We are gonna get there tonight
[Verse 2: Rob Swire]
It's been so far, 
I've been walkin' the line on my own
Lift me up to the stars
, 
we are comin' home
I only had a taste, but we're out of time
We are sold in the cold, physical design
Set me free, set me out on the run
Lift me up to the sun, to the sun, to the
[Pre-Chorus: Rob Swire]
We are burnin' down, we are burnin' down
It's the way that you fake it, I know it's too late[Chorus: Rob Swire]
But I just wanna play it right
We are gonna get there tonight
I just wanna take you down
We are gonna bring you around
[Chorus: Rob Swire]
I just wanna play it right
We are gonna get there tonight
I just wanna take you down
We are gonna bring you around
