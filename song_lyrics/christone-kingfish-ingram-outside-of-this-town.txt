[Verse 1]
I'm leaving this town tomorrow
I got many places to see
And many places to go
I'm so tired of doing the same old thing
Shooting for the highest star
Want people to remember my name
If you don't understand
Let me break it down
I know that there's life
Outside of this town
[Verse 2]
I have friends and family that I see everyday
Don't plan on moving forward
Stuck in the same old place
But that's not the road that I wanna go down
I gotta do what's best for me
Ain't no hanging around
I could stay here forever
But I just can't stick around
I know that there's life
Outside of this town
[Guitar Solo][Verse 3]
When the rooster crows I'm leaving
And I ain't looking back
All you gonna see is taillights
Crossing those railroad tracks
If I don't leave I'll die here
And end up six feet down
I know that there's life
Outside of this town
Outside of this town
Outside of this town
Outside of this town
