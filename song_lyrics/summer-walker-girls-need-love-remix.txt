(Intro)
Honestly..
It's the remix baby
(Verse 1)
Honestly I'm tryna stay focused
And usually I take it slow motion
But I can't
I don't think I can wait
I just need it now
Let me make you shake
I don't need a kiss
I don't want a hug
I'm tired of loving all these lame bitches
Baby I just need a fuck
I can't be the one (hey)
But we can have some fun (hey)
You can play some slow jams baby
Just don't you fall in love
Girls can't ever say they want it
Girls can't ever say how
Girls can't ever say they need it
Girls can't ever say now
Girls can't ever say they want it
Girls can't ever say how
Girls can't ever say they need it
Girls can't ever say now, oh now(Verse 2)
Come and show me
That you need it baby
Want you to get on top
I'll take you up and down
Until you're leaking baby
Or you could be submissive yeah
Cause I could give it to you right babe, oh
So let's get down to business
Our chemistry's real good
Just don't get in your feelings
Don't need your love, hey
Don't need your love, hey
Don't need your love, hey
But we can fuck
(Outro)
Girls need love too (Alright)
Girls, girls, girls need love too
Girls need love too (Let me tell you something)
Girls, girls, girls need love too (Girls be fucking too)
Girls need love too
Girls, girls, girls need love too
(So what's a girl to do when she just wanna fuck too)
Girls need love too
Girls, girls, girls need love too
