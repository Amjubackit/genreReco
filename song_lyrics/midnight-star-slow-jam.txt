[Intro: Bo Watson]
Excuse me
May I have this dance?
[Verse 1: Bo Watson]
I was all alone
I was feeling rather low
I needed someone to lift my spirits up
So I dropped in on a dance
Just to take a glance
And there this sweet lovely thing was
She was more than enough
[Pre-Chorus: Bo Watson]
I asked her for her hand
Said, "Would you like to dance?"
So pleased that I had asked, she quickly took my hand
And we danced and fell in love
On a slow jam, yeah yeah
[Chorus: Midnight Star, Bo Watson]
Play another slow jam, this time make it sweet
A slow jam (For my baby and for me, ooh)
Play another slow jam, this time make it sweet
(Play) A slow jam (A slow jam, yeah)
[Verse 2: Belinda Lipscomb]
Seems what you say is true
I feel the same way too
See, I waited all night long just to dance with you
And when you touched my hand
I knew you were the man
To turn my world around and make my dreams come true
[Pre-Chorus: Belinda Lipscomb]
The magic in your eyes
Made me realize
That everything I feel
Has got to be real
And we danced and fell in love on a slow jam
[Chorus: Midnight Star, Belinda Lipscomb, Bo Watson]
Play another slow jam, this time make it sweet (Ooh, play)
A slow jam
(Play another, another slow jam for me and my baby, yeah)
Play another slow jam, this time make it sweet
(Play another slow jam)
A slow jam (Mmm, yeah)
[Outro: Midnight Star, Belinda Lipscomb, Bo Watson]
(Oh, oh, oh, play a slo-o-ow)
Play another slow jam, this time make it sweet
(Slo-o-ow, play a slow jam, for my baby, my baby)
(Slo-o-ow) Play another slow jam, this time make it sweet
(Slo-o-ow, play a slow jam, ooh-ooh, for my baby)
(Play a slo-o-ow) Play another slow jam, this time make it sweet
(Slo-o-ow, play a slow jam, oh, for my baby)
(Wonâ€™t you play another slow jam)
Play another slow jam, this time make it sweet
(Please Mister DJ) A slow jam (Hey)
(Play a slo-o-ow) Play another slow jam
