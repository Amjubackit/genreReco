Because the Lord is my shepherd
I have everything I need
He lets me rest in the meadow's grass
And He leads me beside the quiet streams
He restores my failing health
And He helps me to do what honors Him the most
That's why I'm safe, that's why I'm safe
That's why I'm safe, safe in His arms
Because the Lord is my shepherd
I have everything I need
He lets me rest in the meadow's grass
And He leads me beside the quiet streams
He restores my failing health
And He helps me to do what honors Him the most
That's why I'm safe, that's why I'm safe
That's why I'm safe, safe in His arms
When the storms, when the storms of life
Are raging and the billows roll
When the storms, when the storms of life
Are raging and the billows roll
I'm glad He shall hide me safe in His arms
I'm glad He shall hide me
