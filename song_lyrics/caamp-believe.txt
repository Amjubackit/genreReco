[Chorus]
I believe in you baby
And I'll always be around
I believe in you baby
I won't let you hit the ground
[Post-Chorus]
And when that sun shines through to the break of dawn
You better grab the keys, and leave the dogs at home, oh
[Chorus]
I believe in you baby
And I'll always be around
I believe in you baby
I won't let you hit the ground
[Post-Chorus]
When that sun shines through to the break of dawn
You better grab the keys, and leave the dogs at home, oh
[Instrumental]
[Chorus]
Abeline, little baby
Know I’ll always be around
Abeline, little baby
I won't let you hit the ground
[Post-Chorus]
When that sun shines through to the break of dawn
You better grab the keys, and leave the dogs at home
