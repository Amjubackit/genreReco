[Chorus]
Freak like me
You want a good girl that does bad things to you
You never been with no one as nasty as me
Spice up your life, come get a freak
Do, do-do, do-do, do-do
Freak like me
[Verse 1]
Tied him down to my queen bed
Tease him just enough to hate me (Hate me)
Tied it tight enough, he can't break free (Break free)
Keep him waiting 'til he try
This can go one of two ways
We could flip the coin, I'll be your slave (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Call you daddy, give me a nickname (Ah)
I ain't afraid of a little pain (No, I ain't 'fraid of a little pain)
Yo, yo, yo, yo (Ah)
He wanted some'n else and he wanna be selfish
He wanted them three rounds, DC had to come help him
Look, I know your position
Try to squeeze in the full nelson though
Beat on it, beat, beat on it, mercy like a black belt give
Daddy the grand master, daddy, I want it faster
Them bitches you fuckin' with, I know they gon' need some practice
So bring 'em along wit' ya, I'll teach 'em how to smash ya
When I made a little mess on it, he told me to clean my act up[Chorus]
Freak like me (Tryna freak you down)
You want a good girl that does bad things to you
You never been with no one as nasty as me
Spice up your life, come get a freak
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo (Like me)
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
[Verse 2]
Hey, I could take a big bat, bet that he thinkin' this a game
Hey, batter, batter swing, you could put it on a swing
Freak like a triple XXX flick, put her on a chain
This pussy off the chain, this kitty insane
I could fuck him in the rain, I could fuck him in the Range (Uh)
I could fuck him every day (Uh), I'ma fuck him 'til he sang (Uh)
Milkshake bring the boys to the yard, I'ma need the whipped cream
Ain't ever been vanilla, honey, just wait until you get a taste
Skirt off, fuck in the backseat
Take that shirt off, baby, put it on me
Got me like, "Yeehaw," ride it like a horsey
Kinda like see-saw, up and down on the D, give it to him
[Chorus]
Freak like me (Need a freak like me)
You want a good girl that does bad things to you (You want a good girl)
You never been with no one as nasty as me
Spice up your life, come get a freak
Do, do-do, do-do, do-do (Now you need a freak)
Freak like me
Freak like me (You never, you never, you never been)
You want a good girl that does bad things to you
You never been with no one as nasty as me
Spice up your life, come get a freak (You need a freak)
Do, do-do, do-do, do-do (You need a freak)
Freak like me (Like me, papa)[Outro]
Babe, you never been with no one nastier than me
Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Put your head on my shoulder
Hold me in your arms, baby
Squeeze me oh so tight
Show me that you love me too
