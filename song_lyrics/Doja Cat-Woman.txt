[Intro]
Hey, woman
Hey, woman
[Chorus]
Woman
Let me be your woman
Woman, woman, woman (
Ayy
)
I can be your woman
Woman, woman, woman (
Ayy
)
Let me be your woman
Woman, woman, woman (
Ayy
)
I can be your woman
Woman, woman, woman (
Ayy
)
[Verse 1]
What you need?
She give tenfold, come here, papa, plant your seed
She can grow right from her womb a family
Provide lovin' overlooked and unappreciated, you see (
Yeah
)
You can reciprocate
I got delicious taste, you need a woman's touch in your place
Just protect her and keep her safe
Baby, worship my hips and waist
So feminine with grace
I touch your soul when you hear me say, "Boy"
Let me be your woman
