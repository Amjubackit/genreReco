[Verse 1: Duddy B]
Tornado, I see you coming around
Don't let go, you know I'm holding you down
These people shouldn't change like the weather, man
People shouldn't change if they innocent
People act strange when it's getting hard to breathe
So let me be your oxygen
[Chorus: Dirty J & (Duddy B)]
Please don't go, I will stay
When everyone is leaving and you're feeling strange
See them all, hear them say
Trying to breathe, but you're feeling strange
Oh woah, feel like you're living, but you might be better off dead
If you're going under, then I'll be your oxygen
(When everything is falling)
I'll be your oxygen
(When everything is falling)
I'll be your oxygen
(When everything is falling)
I'll be your oxygen, yeah
(When everything is falling)
[Verse 2: Duddy B]
Domino, this world keeps knocking you down
Let them know, no one can push you around
Getting hard to breathe in the avalanche
Feels like you never see the sun again
Domino, this world keeps knocking you down[Chorus: Dirty J & (Duddy B)]
Please don't go, I will stay
When everyone is leaving and you're feeling strange
See them all, hear them say
Trying to breathe, but you're feeling strange
Oh woah, feel like you're living, but you might be better off dead
If you're going under, then I'll be your oxygen
(When everything is falling)
I'll be your oxygen
(When everything is falling)
I'll be your oxygen
(When everything is falling)
I'll be your oxygen, yeah
(When everything is falling)
[Bridge: Dirty J]
Laughing with these demons in your head
But they don't mean nothing, they don't mean nothing, no
Feeding off the words that they all say
They don't mean nothing, no
[Chorus: Dirty J & (Duddy B)]
Please don't go, I will stay
When everyone is leaving and you're feeling strange
See them all, hear them say
Trying to breathe, but you're feeling strange
Please don't go, I will stay
When everyone is leaving and you're feeling strange
See them all, hear them say
Trying to breathe, but you're feeling strange
Oh woah, feel like you're living, but you might be better off dead
If you're going under, then I'll be your oxygen
(When everything is falling)
I'll be your oxygen
(When everything is falling)
I'll be your oxygen
(When everything is falling)
I'll be your oxygen, yeah
(When everything is falling)
