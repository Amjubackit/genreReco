[Intro: Buju Banton]
Been a long time and now mi say this a big tune in all di world
[?]
Lighta, lighta
[Verse 1: Victoria Monét, 
Buju Banton
]
No more backs on the wall (
No
)
Come pull me close to you (
Rock
)
Rock me deep into the morning (
Rock
)
'Cause by sunrise I'll be gone
I wanna be leaving with someone
I'll here for a good time and you know we both want it
[Pre-Chorus: Victoria Monét]
And plus I like to sightsee and if you invite me
I'll very likely pull up where you at
You got the right fee or if you entice me
End of the night might sit this on your lap
Staring at me too long might get you in trouble
I'm hypnotizing, I'm just talking facts
Nightly you'll sight me anywhere you might be
[Chorus: Victoria Monét, 
Buju Banton
]
Can't forget about the party girls
Out lighting up thе world
Let's hear it for the party girls
Out lighting up thе world (
All the party girls
)
Ah, ah (
Ah
), ah
Ah, ah, ah[Interlude: Buju Banton]
Now from this tune come on me want everybody in the dancehall right now tonight
Lighta inna the sky
If you're with your lover, if you're with your girl, if you're with your brother, if you're with your sista
Mayday
[Verse 2: Buju Banton, 
Victoria Monét & Buju Banton

Want to know what a true Jamaican night life is like
Alright, work hard play hard, nuh need no sponsor

We say no low vibes come mek we lift this higher
Bun dung the whole club and set the roof on fire
