[Intro: Devin Tracy]
Oh, ooh, oh
Oh, no, oh, oh
[Verse 1: Devin Tracy]
There's a side of me I tend to fight
Watch me fall looking deep in your eyes
Why do I fall in love too easily?
You made me soft, I'm down on my knees
[Chorus: Devin Tracy]
And again, and again
You're breakin' my heart, you doin' this all again
You tear me apart
[Verse 2: Devin Tracy]
What I'm telling you is what you will find
Stay on course runnin' deep in your mind
Just the thought of seein' me again
Wanna know how you're doin' my friend
[Chorus: Devin Tracy]
And again, and again (All again)
You're breakin' my heart, you're doin' it all again
No, no, you tear me apart
