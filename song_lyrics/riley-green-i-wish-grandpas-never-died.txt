[Verse 1]
I wish girls you loved never gave back diamond rings
I wish every porch had a swing
Wish kids still learned to say "sir" and "ma'am", and how to shake a hand
I wish every state had a Birmingham
[Pre-Chorus]
I wish everybody knew all the words to "Mama Tried"
I wish Monday mornin's felt just like Friday nights
[Chorus]
And I wish even cars had truck beds
And every road was named Copperhead
And coolers never run out of cold Bud Light
And I wish high school home teams never lost
And back road drinkin' kids never got caught
And I wish the price of gas was low and cotton was high
I wish honky-tonks didn't have no closin' time
And I wish grandpas never died
[Verse 2]
I wish Sunday's on a creek bank would never end
Wish I could learn to drive again
Wish the first time, seventeen, she was my everything kiss in a Chevrolet
Could happen every day
