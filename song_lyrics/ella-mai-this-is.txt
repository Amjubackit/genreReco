[Intro]
This is
[Verse 1]
Just wanna love you for my whole life
Do it for you, I'ma make time
I wanna kick it until midnight
Just to be with you 'til the sunrise
I think you're making me crazy
Put my heart upon the main line, I
Got this trust for you
Got it 'cause I know what you like (I love ya)
[Pre-Chorus]
Good and bad, thick and thin, flaws and all
And if ya ever in the wrong, I'll let you know
Yeah, I know that love is unpredictable
But I'm pretty damn sure that
[Chorus]
This is
The kinda love that keeps me up all night
This is
What I wanna do for the rest of my life
This is
Something that can get every bit of my time
This is
What they call real love, real love, real love[Verse 2]
You saw my halo (Halo)
Even on days when you should hate most (Hate most)
Laid up, I'm stuck with you (Like glue)
So tell me 'bout it, how'd ya day go? (I want you)
Kissing on me
Missing on me
Every time I see you, got them feelings on me (So I'm)
Kissing on you (And you)
Loving on me
Yeah, I won't play with your heart (I love ya)
[Pre-Chorus]
Good and bad, thick and thin, flaws and all
And if ya ever in the wrong, I'll let you know
Yeah, I know that love is unpredictable
But I'm pretty damn sure that
[Chorus]
This is
The kinda love that keeps me up all night
This is
What I wanna do for the rest of my life
This is
Something that can get every bit of my time
This is
What they call real love, real love, real love[Bridge]
Oh, I know that you told me as long as you hold me, I couldn't be safer
Oh, love me for the real me, don't know what your deal is, but I'm with you 'til
Daylight, daylight, daylight
'Til the sun comes up
Dancing in the moonlight, moonlight, moonlight
This forever, this forever
[Chorus]
This is
The kinda love that keeps me up all night (Kinda love that keeps me up all night)
This is
What I wanna do for the rest of my life (For the rest of my life)
This is
Something that can get every bit of my time (Every bit of my time)
This is
What they call real love, real love, real love
[Outro]
This is, this is
This is
