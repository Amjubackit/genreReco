[Verse 1]
If it’s bandaging the broken
Or washing filthy feet
Here I am Lord, send me
If it’s loving one another
Even when we don’t agree
Here I am Lord, send me
[Verse 2]
If I’m poor or if I’m wealthy
I’ll serve You just the same
Here I am Lord, send me
On the mountain or the valley
I will choose to praise
Here I am Lord, send me
[Chorus]
If I’m known by how I love
Let my life reflect how much I love You
I love You
And before You еven ask
Oh my answer will be yеs
‘Cause I love You
Oh I love You
[Verse 3]
If the truth cuts like an arrow
I will say it anyway
‘Cause here I am Lord, send me
If it’s means that they’ll reject me
Lord I will still obey
‘Cause here I am Lord, send me[Chorus]
If I’m known by how I love
Let my life reflect how much I love You
I love You
And before You even ask
Oh my answer will be yes
‘Cause I love You
Oh I love You
[Verse 4]
When I’m standing in Your glory
I’ll be glad I chose to say
Here I am Lord, send me
Well done good and faithful
I live to hear You say
Here I am Lord, send me
Here I am Lord, send me
Here I am Lord, send me
[Chorus]
If I’m known by how I love
Let my life reflect how much I love You
I love You
And before You even ask
Oh my answer will be yes
‘Cause I love You
Oh I love You
If I’m known by how I love
Let my life reflect how much I love You
I love You
And before You even ask
Oh my answer will be yes
‘Cause I love You
Oh how I love You[Spontaneous]
Oh how I love You
With everything
With all my dreams, all my hopes
How I love You
You can have it all, You can have it all
You can have it all
Here I am Lord, send me
Here I am Lord, send me
Here I am Lord, send me
Here I am Lord, send me
Here I am Lord, send me
Here I am Lord, send me
(What I have I give You God)
Here I am Lord, send me
(Be it unto me according to Your Word)
Here I am Lord, send me
Here I am Lord, send me
