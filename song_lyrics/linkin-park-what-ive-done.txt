[Verse 1]
In this farewell
There's no blood, there's no alibi
'Cause I've drawn regret
From the truth of a thousand lies
[Pre-Chorus]
So let mercy come and wash away
[Chorus]
What I've done
I'll face myself
 
to cross out what I've become
Erase myself and let go of what I've done
[Verse 2]
Put to rest what you thought of me
While I clean this slate
With the hands of uncertainty
[Pre-Chorus]
So let mercy come and wash away
[Chorus]
What I've done
I'll face myself 
to cross out what I've become
Erase myself and let go of what I've done
