[Chorus 1]
Don't wash the cast iron skillet
Don't drink and drive, you'll spill it
Don't ask too many questions or you'll never get to sleep
There's a hole inside you, fill it
[Verse 1]
Shower up and shave, put flowers on the grave
And ask the Lord to save his soul although you know it's too late
Was it 27 times or was it 29?
I heard the blade broke off inside the man and he took a while to die
[Verse 2]
How did he get so low? Seems like just a week ago
We were 10 and 12 years old
He was sweet and soft, shied away from the inside fastballs
And died doing life without parolе
[Chorus 2]
Don't wash the cast iron skillet
That dog bites my kid, I'll kill it
Don't walk whеre you can't see your feet
Don't ask questions, just believe it
[Verse 3]
Jamie found a boyfriend with smiling eyes and dark skin
And her daddy never spoke another word to her again
The old man at the Quick Stop, lying to the county cops
And laughing like his soul was without sin
[Verse 4]
How did he get so low? Seems like just a week ago
She was sitting on your shoulders watching fireworks in the sky
He treats her like a queen, but you don't know 'cause you ain't seen
It's hard to go through life without your daddy by your side
[Chorus 3]
Don't wash the cast iron skillet
This town won't get no better, will it?
She found love and it was simple as a weathervane
But her own family tried to kill it
[Outro]
Don't wash the cast iron skillet
Don't wash the cast iron skillet
Don't wash the cast iron
