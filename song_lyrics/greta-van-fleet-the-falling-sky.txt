[Verse 1]
I've been handed a quite demanding
And hardly standing lie to tell
Life is sorted and never thwarted
It's just supported by being well
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I don't wanna lose this time
Oh, I just wanna let it pass
[Chorus]
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, holding up the falling sky
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, holding up the falling sky
[Verse 2]
Here's the trouble with seeing double
It's torn-down rubble that's left behind
You can live with a pointless forte
That silly board game that you would know
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I don't wanna lose this time
I just wanna let it pass[Chorus]
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, holding up the falling sky
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, holding up the falling sky
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, holding up the falling sky
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, holding up the falling sky
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, holding up the falling sky
