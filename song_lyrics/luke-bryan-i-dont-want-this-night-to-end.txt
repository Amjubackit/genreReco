[Verse 1]
Girl I know I don’t know you
But your pretty little eyes so blue
Are pulling me in
Like the moon on your skin
I’m so glad you trusted me
To slide up on this dusty seat
And let your hair down
Get out of town
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Got the stars coming out over my hood
And all I know now is it's going good
[Chorus]
You got your hands up
You’re rocking in my truck
You got the radio on
You’re singing every song
I’m set on cruise control
I’m slowly losing hold
Of everything I got
You’re looking so damn hot
[Post-Chorus]
And I don’t know what road we’re on
Or where we’ve been
From staring at you girl
All I know is I don’t want this night to end
