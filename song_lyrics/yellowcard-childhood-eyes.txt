[Intro]
I found, I found my childhood eyes
Am I the only one
Who ever wonders why?
Love leaves me empty every time
Am I the only one
Who isn't dead inside?
Maybe you're jaded, maybe you're blind
Am I the only one watching with childhood eyes?
[Verse 1]
I'm all alone at the altar now
I've got an atheist heart
You swept it under the rug and bailed
Yeah, you're a real work of art
If only I was the drug you did
Stuck in a vein in your arm
Thеn maybe you would've stuck around
Just like thе addict you are
[Chorus]
I found, I found my childhood eyes
Am I the only one
Who ever wonders why?
Love leaves me empty every time
Am I the only one
Who isn't dead inside?
Maybe you're jaded, maybe you're blind
Am I the only one watching with childhood eyes?[Verse 2]
I'm all alone in the ocean now
And you're a light on the shore
I know you think you can hold your breath
Until I sink to the floor
But if you're tryin' to wait this out
You're gonna do it alone
There's gotta be something more than this
Some other truth I can know
(Truth I can know)
[Chorus]
I found, I found my childhood eyes
Am I the only one
Who ever wonders why?
Love leaves me empty every time
Am I the only one
Who isn't dead inside?
Maybe you're jaded, maybe you're blind
Am I the only one watching with childhood eyes?
Watching with childhood eyes
[Bridge]
I am the love you need
I am the love you need
Let's go[Outro]
I am the love you need
I am the love you need
I am the love you need
I am the love you need
