[Verse 1: Jonathan McReynolds]
Didn't I conquer this last year?
Tell me what I missed 'cause I fear
That it's coming back up again
Must be something I ate
Some song, some show, some hate
The devil wants to extend the game, free throws
And when it ends he wants to make the sequel
'Cause if he has another chance
He feels like he can take
My joy, my peace, my faith
[Chorus: Jonathan McReynolds & DOE]
See the devil, he learns from your mistakes
Even if you don't
That's how he keeps you in cycles, cycles
Cycles, cycles
But I'm not going in cycles, cycles
Cycles, cycles
[Verse 2: DOE]
This will end like I want it to, I win
The enemy will have to lose again
See, I'm a different fighter now
And I have God to thank
'Cause His joy is my strength
[Chorus: DOE & Jonathan McReynolds]
See the devil will learn it's a mistake
When I am sure
That I'm not going in cycles
I'm not going in cycles
I'm gonna break these cycles
I'm not going in cycles
I'm gonna break these cycles
I'm not going in cycles
Cycles, cycles
I'm not going in cycles
[Bridge: Jonathan McReynolds & DOE]
Ooh, so Lord, help me
Be free from all of my past sin
See, Your love is enough
To make me new
And help me end these cycles, cycles
Help me in these cycles, ooh Lord, cycles
I need You to help me in these cycles
I rebuke him in the name of Jesus, oh
Cycles, cycles
[Chorus: Jonathan McReynolds & DOE]
See I'm not going in cycles
I refuse it, cycles
I refuse it, cycles
Oh, refuse it, cycles
Oh, woe, depression, cycles
Oh, all I'm saying, cycles
Oh, I'm not going in cycles
Yeah, cycles
[Outro: Jonathan McReynolds]
See, there is power in the name of Jesus
There is power in the name of Jesus
See, there is power in the name of Jesus
To break every cycle, to break every cycle
See, there is power in the name of Jesus
See, there is power in the name of Jesus
There is power in the name of Jesus
To break every cycle, to break all these cycle
To break all these cycle, to break all these cycle
Generational cycles, financial cycles
Painful cycles, oh, cycles
