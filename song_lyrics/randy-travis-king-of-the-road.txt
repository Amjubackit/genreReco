Trailers for sale or rent, rooms to let fifty cents
No phone, no pool, no pets, I ain't got no cigarettes
Ah, but two hours of pushin' broom buys an eight by twelve four bit room
I'm a man of means by no means, king of the road
Third boxcar, midnight train, destination, Bangor, Maine
Old worn out suit and shoes, I don't pay no union dues
I smoke old stogies I have found, short, but not too big around
I'm a man of means by no means, king of the road
I know every engineer on every train
All of their children and all of their names
Every handout in every town
And every lock that ain't locked when no one's around
I sing, trailers for sale or rent, rooms to let, fifty cents
No phone, no pool, no pets, I ain't got no cigarettes
Ah, but, two hours of pushin' broom buys an eight by twelve four bit room

King of the road, king of the road
