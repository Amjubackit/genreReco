[Intro: Smino & 
Bari
]
Off some real life shit though, bro
I've been having some wild ass, like I ain't even on no recording shit right now bro
What you mean?
Bro
What fo'?
You ain't gon' believe this
[Chorus: Smino]
She suck me in the Sprinter with my entourage and shit (Entourage)
Face all on my stomach, got her Fenty on my fit (Hold up)
Makeup on my acne like I'm tryna hide a zit
Wear my clothes too baggy, shit I'm tryna hide my zip
Now, baby, I'm too fucking grown to teach you how to ride a dick
Need a freaky college boo for frolicking, booty brolic,, yeah
[Refrain: Bari]
I cop a new drop, in white tee, ayy
I fuck a new bitch, in white tee
[Verse 1: Smino]
Okay, I copped a whip and wrapped it with the shiny polish
Yo' bitch a dub, she 20 dollars (Harriet)
I'm so lit right now, I'm up, I'm the night owl (Hoo!)
She wet, clean up aisle two
From Tibet, I'm willin' to bet, the nigga's a vet
I'm the clit commander, she wet like a salamander (Salamander)
Green diamonds in my charm, that's a frozen salad
Neck on vegan, freezing (Mmm), check my color palette (Mmm), white like a bunny wabbit (Mmm)
You know I keep some carrots (Mmm), eat a bitch like a sandwich (Mmm)
Took her ass to Quiznos[Chorus: Smino]
She suck me in the Sprinter with my entourage and shit (Entourage)
Face all on my stomach, got her Fenty on my fit (Hold up)
Makeup on my acne like I'm tryna hide a zit (Oh naw)
Wear my clothes too baggy, shit I'm tryna hide my zip
Now, baby, I'm too fucking grown to teach you how to ride a dick
Need a freaky college boo for frolicking, booty brolic, yeah
[Refrain: Bari]
I cop a new drop, in white tee, ayy (In white tee, hoo)
I fuck a new bitch, in white tee (White tee, hoo)
We smoke a whole zip in white tee (White tee)
White tee, white tee (White tee), white tee, white tee (White tee), ayy (Ayy)
I cop a new drop, in white tee, ayy, huh
I fuck a new bitch, in white tee
We smoke a whole zip in white tee (White tee)
White tee (White tee), white tee (White tee), white tee, white tee (White tee), ayy (Ayy)
[Verse 2: Jay2]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Copped a new drop and I'm dropping the top, down
The game is on lock, now
I'm out of town and the pussy on lock, down
And after she knocked out, yeah
I got a raise (I had to raise up)
And she do whatever I say like your honor
I feel like Rico, I call her Teyana
Super head, I think her name was Kiana
I call her Kiki the way she be riding'
Slippery slippery slopes, ooh
Diamonds that bitch on a slope, ooh
I got a stoke, she beg me to poke
She wouldn't believe in the stroke, ooh
White tee on, I'm in a Tes'
PJ to New York, she feel like a Jet
I'm in her mouth just like Colgate or Crest, ooh, ooh, ooh
You a freak[Chorus: Smino]
She suck me in the Sprinter with my entourage and shit
Face all on my stomach, got her Fenty on my fit
Makeup on my acne like I'm tryna hide a zit
Wear my clothes too baggy, shit I'm tryna hide my zip
Now, baby, I'm too fucking grown to teach you how to ride a dick
Need a freaky college boo for frolicking, booty brolic, yeah
