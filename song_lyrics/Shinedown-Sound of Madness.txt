[Intro]
Yeah, I get it you're an outcast
Always under attack
Always comin' in last
Bringin' up the past
No one owes you anything
I think you need a shotgun blast
A kick in the ass
So paranoid, watch your back
Oh my, here we go
[Verse 1]
Another loose cannon gone bipolar
Slipped down, couldn't get much lower
Quicksand's got no sense of humor
I'm still laughin' like hell
[Pre-Chorus]
You think that by cryin' to me
Lookin' so sorry that I'm gonna believe
You've been infected by a social disease
Well, then take your medicine
[Chorus]
I created the sound of madness
Wrote the book on pain
Somehow I'm still here
To explain
That the darkest hour never comes in the night
You can sleep with a gun
But when you gonna wake up and fight
For yourself
