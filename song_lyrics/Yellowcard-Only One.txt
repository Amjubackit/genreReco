[Verse 1]
Broken this fragile thing now
And I can't, I can't pick up the pieces
And I've thrown my words all around
But I can't, I can't give you a reason
[Pre-Chorus]
I feel so broken up (So broken up)
And I give up (I give up)
I just wanna tell you so you know
[Chorus]
Here I go
Scream my lungs out and try to get to you
You are my only one
I let go
But there's just no one that gets me like you do
You are my only, my only one
[Verse 2]
I made my mistakes, let you down
And I can't, I can't hold on for too long
Ran my whole life in the ground
And I can't, I can't get up when you're gone
[Pre-Chorus]
And something's breakin' up (Breakin' up)
I feel like givin' up (Like givin' up)
I won't walk out until you know
