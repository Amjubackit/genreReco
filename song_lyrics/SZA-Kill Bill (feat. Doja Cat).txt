[Intro: Doja Cat]
Yeah, I love you
[Verse 1: Doja Cat]
I'm in a funk, so I bought a bouquet of roses
And cut 'em up at your doorstep, your new neighborhood is gorgeous
I paid a lotta money for the fragrances you wore when we were dating
And I sold some lemonade just to afford them
I know it's not a really good occasion to be bargin' in
I couldn't help but watch you kiss her by the kitchen sink
I swung the door open, tippy-toed farther in
I wasn't cryin', I was starin' and forgot to blink
She saw me standin' by the TV and she wouldn't stop screamin'
So I tried to be discreet and told her, "Calm your tits"
She grabbed the kitchen knife, so I pulled out the blick
Ain't got it all the time, thank God I did for this
'Cause she was seein' red, and all I saw was you
It happened in a flash when she charged at me
Y'all criss-crossed, saw her fall to the floor
Then you paused there in horror, that shot wasn't for her
[Chorus: SZA, 
Doja Cat
]
I might (
Was it?
)
I might kill my ex, not the best idea
His new girlfriend's next, how'd I get here?
I might kill my ex, I still love him, though
Rather be in jail than alone
