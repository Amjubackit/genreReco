[Verse 1]
How do I thank You
For all of the ways
All of the ways You've come through?
How do I thank You?
How do I thank You
For all of the doors I've walked through?
How do I thank You?
[Chorus]
And how can I say it
When no words in any language
Could summarize the love I have for You?
I am filled with endless gratitude
But how do I thank You?
[Verse 2]
How do I thank You
For all of the hurt and all of the pain I go through?
How do I thank You?
How do I thank You
For all of the doors You kept me from going through?
How do I thank You?
[Chorus]
How can I say it
When no words in any language
Could summarize the love I have for You?
I am filled with endless gratitude
But how do I thank You?[Post-Chorus]
(Oh) How do I thank You? (How do I thank You? How do I thank You?)
(Ooh, oh) Ooh, ooh
[Bridge]
For all that You've given me
I am in-debt to You
This is my offering
This is my gratitude
For all that You've done for me
I give mysеlf to You
I am here at Your feet
This is my thanks to You
[Verse 1]
How do I thank You
For all of the ways
All of thе ways You've come through?
How do I thank You?
How do I thank You
For all of the doors I've walked through?
How do I thank You?
