[Verse 1]
Can’t get no sleep
The moon, it knows I
Don’t want you to leave
I think you're divine, I
Left the old me
Just to be with you, I try
To be free with you
I’d fall back down to earth
So what you want?
[Pre-Chorus]
You're killing me softly
Know that you love me
Maybe I'm honestly falling too soon
I’m happy we’re grown now
Don’t gotta love you on the low now
Can you hit me when you're home?
And I’ll come running back to you
[Chorus]
I need you to be
Myself again, I
Need to believe
I'm worth the work, I
Need you to see
Parts of me I hide
Parts of me
I hide away for someone else to find
