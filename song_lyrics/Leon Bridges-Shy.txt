[Verse 1]
Staring at the ceiling
Hearts and records spinning, round (Mmm)
I've been, loving with no meaning
Running from a feeling now
You know that I want you
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Mmm, don't get me started at this time of night
Hard to keep my guard up and the feeling's right
I don't need nobody but for you I might
And all that want is you
[Chorus]
I just want to see you, you could come over
I know your shy, you can be shy with me
You know I need you and I’m not quite sober
I know your shy baby, you can be shy, it’s alright
I just want to see you, you can come over
I know your shy, you can be shy with me
You know I need you and I’m not quite sober
I know your shy baby, you can be shy, you can be shy with me
[Verse 2]
Met you back in August
Thought you were standoffish, coy (Mmm)
But you don't have to try
I'll read between your lines (Ohh)
‘Cause all that I want is you
