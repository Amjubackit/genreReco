Standing in the street
Calling out my name
Yeah, your makeup was a mess
And your hair was covered in rain
Well, the record played our favorite song
We danced the night away
Yeah, the record played our favorite song
And we drank the night away
And lover of mine, slow down your pace
'Cause in the morning, you'll be getting right back to it
And lay down with me, come back to bed
'Cause I'll be here waiting for you to put on that dress
And lover of mine, and I'm standing in line
To ask for your hand, I just pray that it's mine
And I've been trying just to keep you 'round
But you've got big plans
And if you ever find yourself on this side of town
Just know you've got a place to sleep
Just know you've got a place to sleep
Just know that you'll be safe with me
Oh, just know that I will always be there for you
Just know you've got a place to sleep
And lover of mine, slow down your pace
'Cause in the morning, you'll be getting right back to it
And lay down with me, come back to bed
'Cause I'll be here waiting for you to put on that dress
And lover of mine, and I'm standing in line
To ask for your hand, I just pray that it's mine
