[Intro: Jess Higgs]
Ooh-ooh, now ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, now ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, now ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, now ooh-ooh
[Verse 1: Jess Higgs]
You know I used to be alright
When you woke me in the morning
Waiting for the sun to shine
And do the two-step all night
Then you'd spin me 'round and catch me
Laughing as the sun would rise, sun would rise
[Pre-Chorus: Jess Higgs]
Oh, I don't know what to do
You speak a foreign language when you put me through
The enemies, I know you're hiding one or two
But I just can't say no to you
[Chorus: Jess Higgs]
So I can't let you go and you won't let me know
I can't let you go and you won't say
I can't let you go but you won't let me know
I can't let you go, I, I slip away[Verse 2: Jess Higgs]
Boy, it's just a puzzle
And the pieces they have scattered on the floor
It's a silly little game
But the sentences are scribbled on the wall
You think you have the time
But we should open up the rise
And the bottom of the matter
Is it takes up all your time, takes up all your time
[Pre-Chorus: Jess Higgs]
Oh, I don't know what to do
You speak a foreign language when you put me through
The enemies, I know you're hiding one or two
But I just can't say no to you
[Chorus: Jess Higgs]
So I can't let you go and you won't let me know
I can't let you go and you won't say
I can't let you go but you won't let me know
I can't let you go, I, I slip away
[Bridge: Jess Higgs]
Never ending stories lead me to the door
Then I wait alone just like I did before
Another mystery is laying down the rhymes
Seems you are distracted and you never have the time[Chorus: Jess Higgs]
So I can't let you go and you won't let me know
I can't let you go and you won't say
I can't let you go but you won't let me know
I can't let you go and I slip away
