[Verse 1]
So you've come a long way
(Huh, woo-hoo)
But you’re never out late
Never had plans for a normal life
It's crime, too busy earnin'
You can't get enough
[Pre-Chorus]
Just busy earnin'
You can’t get enough
[Chorus]
You think that all your time is used
Too busy earnin'
You can't get enough
[Verse 2]
And I get it always
But I bet it won't change, no
Damn, that's a boring life
It's crime, busy earnin'
You can't get enough
[Pre-Chorus]
Just busy earnin'
You can’t get enough[Chorus]
You think that all your time is used
Too busy earnin'
You can't get enough
[Pre-Chorus]
Just busy earnin'
You can't get enough
[Chorus]
You think that all your time is used
Too busy earnin'
You can't get enough
[Chorus]
You think that all your time is used
Too busy earnin'
You can't get enough
[Outro]
Just busy earnin'
You can't get enough, no
Just busy earnin'
You can't get enough
