[Verse 1]
I know it ain't all that late
But you should probably leave
And I recognize that look in your eyes
Yeah, you should probably leave
[Chorus]
'Cause I know you and you know me
And we both know where this is gonna lead
You want me to say that I want you to stay
So you should probably leave
Yeah, you should probably leave
[Verse 2]
There's still time for you to finish your wine
Then you should probably leave
And it's hard to resist, alright, just one kiss
Then you should probably leave
[Chorus]
'Cause I know you and you know me
And we both know where this is gonna lead
You want me to say that I want you to stay
So you should probably leave
Yeah, you should probably leave
