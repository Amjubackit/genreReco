[Verse 1]
Every night I hope and pray
A dream lover will come my way
A girl to hold in my arms
And know the magic of her charms
[Chorus 1]
'Cause I want (Yeah-yeah, yeah)
A girl (Yeah-yeah, yeah)
To call (Yeah-yeah, yeah)
My own (Yeah-yeah, yeah)
I want a dream lover
So I don't have to dream alone
[Chorus 2]
Dream lover, where are you
With a love, oh, so true
And the hand that I can hold
To feel you near as I grow old
[Chorus 1]
'Cause I want (Yeah-yeah, yeah)
A girl (Yeah-yeah, yeah)
To call (Yeah-yeah, yeah)
My own (Yeah-yeah, yeah)
I want a dream lover
So I don't have to dream alone
