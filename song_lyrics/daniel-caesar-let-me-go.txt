[Verse 1]
I'm tryna breathe, why won't you let me?
I'm tryna leave, please just forget me
And honestly, our sun is setting
Can hardly believe, this got so messy
[Pre-Chorus]
Ain't gon' sleep tonight
My dreams exhaust me
I'll be awake 'til the light
It's 'bout that time that I break away before my time expires
[Chorus]
Baby, won't you let me go? Oh, oh
(Let go, let go, let go)
Baby, won't you let me go? Oh, oh
(Let go, let go, let go)
[Verse 2]
I'm not afraid of manipulation
Stuck in your ways, I've run out of patience
You're lying when you tell me that you won't be fine
I'm not leadin' you on I'm leavin' you behind
[Pre-Chorus]
Ain't no sleep tonight
My dreams exhaust me
I'll be awake 'til the light
It's 'bout that time that I break away before my time expires[Chorus]
Baby, won't you let me go? Oh, oh
(Let go, let go, let go)
Baby, won't you let me go? Oh, oh
(Let go, let go, let go)
[Outro]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
(Let go, let go, let go)
Ooh, ooh, ooh
(Let go, let go, let go)
Ooh, ooh, ooh
(Let go, let go, let go)
Ooh, ooh, ooh
(Let go, let go, let go)
