[Verse 1]
How long are you gonna try to hide your heart?
Girl, you pull me in close, but you only let me go so far
I can see that diamond shinning bright, but it's buried in the coal mine dark
How long are you gonna try to hide your heart?
[Chorus]
Baby, I would dig down
To the bottom of the cold ground
Under the roots of your hometown
Where your skeletons live
Come on, let me show you what I'm worth
Put these never quitting hands to work
I ain't afraid of a little dirt
Girl, your love's a gift
And I ain't afraid to dig
I ain't afraid to dig
[Verse 2]
Can you take me behind blue eyes
And long blonde hair?
What you dream while you cry
Wherе you run when you get scared
Evеry inch I dig gonna make me rich
'Cause I know there's gold in there
Can you take me behind blue eyes
And long blonde hair? Baby, I swear[Chorus]
I would dig down
To the bottom of the cold ground
Under the roots of your hometown
Where your skeletons live
Come on, let me show you what I'm worth
Put these never quitting hands to work
I ain't afraid of a little dirt
Girl, your love's a gift
And I ain't afraid to dig
[Bridge]
How long are you gonna try to hide your heart?
Girl, you pull me in close, but you only let me go so far
[Chorus]
Baby, I would dig down
To the bottom of the cold ground
Under the roots of your hometown
Where your skeletons live
Come on, let me show you what I'm worth
Put these never quitting hands to work
I ain't afraid of a little dirt
Girl, your love's a gift
And I ain't afraid to dig
I ain't afraid to dig
