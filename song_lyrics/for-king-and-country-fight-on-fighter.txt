[Verse 1: Luke Smallbone]
I was there on the day that your world changed
You were scared, unprepared for the heartbreak
Everything you knew faded out of view
Stole a piece of you
[Verse 2: Luke Smallbone]
If I could, oh, I would be your hero
Be the one who would take all the arrows
Save you from the pain, carry all the weight
But I know that you're brave
[Chorus: Luke Smallbone, 
Luke & Joel Smallbone
]
Fight on, fighter
Don't let anyone steal your fire
Fight on, fighter
The Spirit is alive inside ya, yeah
[Post-Chorus: Joel Smallbone]

[Verse 3: Luke Smallbone, 
Luke & Joel Smallbone

There's a power that you hold that you locked down
Let it breathe, give it wings, set it free now
Time to make your mark, break the prison bars
Show them who you are[Chorus: Joel & Luke Smallbone]
Fight on, fighter
Don't let anyone steal your fire
Fight on, fighter
The Spirit is alive inside ya, yeah
