[Verse 1]
I'm still a fan even though I was salty
Hate to see you with some other broad, know you happy
Hate to see you happy if I'm not the one drivin'
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm so mature, I'm so mature
I'm so mature, I got me a therapist to tell me there's other men
I don't want none, I just want you
If I can't have you, no one should, I might
[Chorus]
I might kill my ex, not the best idea
His new girlfriend's next, how'd I get here?
I might kill my ex, I still love him, though
Rather be in jail than alone
[Verse 2]
I get the sense that it's a lost cause
I get the sense that you might really love her
The text gon' be evidence, this text is evidence
I try to ration with you, no murders, no crime of passion
But, damn, you was out of reach
You was at the farmer's market with your perfect peach
Now I'm in amazement, playin' on my patience
Now you layin' face-down, got me singin' over a beat
