[Verse 1]
I called you again
I don't know why I keep on
Thinking that we're friends
'Cause we don't really talk anymore
And I'm sorry for that
Honestly I never really loved you that bad
[Chorus]
And I could be the end of it
But I never know when to stop talking
So I make my bed and sleep in it alone
'Cause I never know when we're done talking
If I don't love you, then why
[Verse 2]
Did I call you again?
I think that I was lonely
And I missed having friends
Now we don't really talk anymore
And it's good for us both
'Cause I know you love me the most
[Chorus]
And I should be the end of it
But I never know when to stop talking
So I make my bed and sleep in it alone
'Cause I never know when we're done talking
And I should be the end of it
But I never know when to stop talking (When to stop talking)
So I make my bed and sleep in it alone
'Cause I never know when we're done talking
You're better off on your own[Bridge]
But you called me again
I don't know why it never seems to end
Now we don't really talk anymore
And it makes sense
'Cause all I do is hurt you
All I do is hurt you
All I do is cause you pain
[Outro]
'Cause I called you again
