[Intro]
Hi! Hi! We're your weather girls
(Uh huh)
And have we got news for you!
(You better listen)
Get ready all you lonely girls
And leave those umbrellas at home
(Alright)
[Pre-Chorus]
Humidity is rising (Mm rising), barometer's getting low
 (How low, girl?)
According to all sources  (What sources now?)
The street's the place to go (You better hurry up)
'Cause tonight for the first time (First time)
Just about half-past ten (Half-past ten)
For the first time in history
It's gonna start raining men (Start raining men)
[Chorus]
It's raining men! Hallelujah!
It's raining men! Amen!
I'm gonna go out to run and let myself get
Absolutely soaking wet!
It's raining men! Hallelujah!
It's raining men! Every specimen!
Tall, blonde, dark and lean
Rough and tough and strong and mean
