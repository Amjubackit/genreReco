[Intro:

Are you plugged in? (
Yeah
)
Alright, you ready?
One-two, a one-two-three
[Verse 1]
I 
don't
 play video games 
no more
, never play video games
Except for a little bit of God of War, never play video games
Maybe a once in a while, a little bit of Fallout 4
But that's okay, not right now, I got things to do
[Verse 2]
'Cause I don't play video games no more, I never play video games
But Red Dead Redemption II, that is not a game
It's an incredible journey through old American history
Fighting for your life and fighting for your family
Trying to live your days with honour and intеgrity
That's not a game, that's an adult thing
That's not a game at all, that's like fuckin' Shakеspeare
Frigig-gigigig-gigigig-gigigig-gigigig-gigigig-gigig
[Bridge]
You know I don't play video games no more
Tiny bit of video game
I guess I still play fuckin' video games
Yee-haw[Outro]
That's it, that's the one
It's on the album
