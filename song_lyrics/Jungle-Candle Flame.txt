[Intro]
I want you there
I want you there
I want you there
I want you there
[Refrain]
You got me burning like a candle flame
You're gonna hurt because you never change
Take me from the darkness tryna heal my pain
Hear my prayer, hear my prayer
(Let's go)
You (Yes I did it for)
You (Yes I did it for)
You (Yes I did it for)
You (Yes I did it for)
[Verse 1]
Feels like the first time I made time in a minute
Rock with it, I'm in attendance
How can we put these feelings aside
I gotta match the fires to the flame
The feelings just got attached
I got the days for the stray far away
Smoulder waves, we started dancing
Know we had to take you back home
Time movin' slow, we fast forward
