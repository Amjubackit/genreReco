[Verse 1]
I am watching the rise and fall
Of my salvation
There's so much shit around me
Such a lack of compassion
[Pre-Chorus]
I thought it would be fun and games (It would be fun and games)
Instead, it's all the same (It's all the same)
I want something to do
Need to feel the sickness in you
[Chorus]
I feel the reason as it's leavin' me
No, not again
It's quite deceiving as I'm feeling
The flesh make me bad
[Verse 2]
All I do is look for you
I need my fix, you need it too
Just to get some sort of attention
Attention
[Pre-Chorus]
What does it mean to you? (What does it mean to you?)
For me, it's something I just do (I just do)
I want something
I need to feel the sickness in you
[Chorus]
I feel the reason as it's leavin' me
No, not again
It's quite deceiving as I'm feeling
The flesh make me bad
I feel the reason as it's leavin' me
No, not again
It's quite deceiving as I'm feeling
The flesh make me bad
[Instrumental Break]
[Outro]
I feel the reason as it's leavin' me
No, not again
It's quite deceiving as I'm feeling
The flesh make me bad (Does it make me bad?)
I feel the reason as it's leavin' me
No, not again (Does it make me bad?)
It's quite deceiving as I'm feeling
The flesh make me bad
(Does it make me bad?)
(Does it make me bad?)
(Does it make me bad?)
(Does it make me bad?)
