[Verse 1]
Baby, seasons change, but people don't, and
I'll always be waiting in the back room
I'm boring, but overcompensate with
Headlines and flash, flash, flash photography
[Pre-Chorus]
But don't pretend you ever forgot about me
Don't pretend you ever forgot about me
[Chorus]
Wouldn't you rather be a widow than a divorcee?
Style your wake for fashion magazines
Widow or a divorcee?
Don't pretend, d-d-d-don't pretend
[Post-Chorus]
We don't fight fair, we don't fight fair
[Verse 2]
They say your head can be a prison
Then these are just conjugal visits
People will dissect us till
This doesn't mean a thing anymore
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't pretend you ever forgot about me
Don't pretend you ever forgot about me[Chorus]
Wouldn't you rather be a widow than a divorcee?
Style your wake for fashion magazines, oh-oh-oh
Widow or a divorcee?
Don't pretend, d-d-d-don't pretend
[Bridge]
We do it in the dark with smiles on our faces
We're trapped and well concealed in secret places, whoa
We do it in the dark with smiles on our faces
We're trapped and well concealed in secret places
[Post-Chorus]
We don't fight fair, we don't fight fair, we don't fight fair
We don't fight fair, we don't fight fair...
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge]
We do it in the dark with smiles on our faces
We're trapped and well concealed in secret places, whoa
We do it in the dark with smiles on our faces
We're trapped and well concealed in secret places
[Outro]
We don't fight fair, 
with smiles on our faces
We're trapped and well concealed in secret places
We don't fight fair (
Don't pretend you ever forgot about me
)
We don't fight fair (
Don't pretend you ever forgot about me
)
We don't fight fair
