[Intro]
Turn it up
Turn it up
Turn it up
Turn it up, up
[Verse 1]
Sometimes it's good to whisper
And keep your voice down low
But sometimes you've gotta risk it
And let the whole world know
Don't wanna be too quiet
I'd rather get real loud
We gonna start a riot
Come on, I'll show you how
[Pre-Chorus]
Let's get a little bit louder
Let's get a little bit louder
Gotta get a little bit louder
Let's get a little bit
[Chorus]
Turn it up, let's just see how high we can go
Turn it up, no stopping 'til we lose all control
Turn it up, until we feel it down in our soul
Turn it up, up[Verse 2]
Let's get your heartbeat pumping
This is the honest truth
If we get these bodies jumping
We're gonna shake it loose
[Pre-Chorus]
Let's get a little bit louder
Let's get a little bit louder
Gotta get a little bit louder
Let's get a little bit
[Chorus]
Turn it up, let's just see how high we can go
Turn it up, no stopping 'til we lose all control
Turn it up, until we feel it down in our soul
Turn it up, up
Turn it up, let's just see how high we can go
Turn it up, no stopping 'til we lose all control
Turn it up, until we feel it down in our soul
Turn it up, up
[Bridge]
Let's get a little bit louder
Let's get a little bit louder
Gotta get a little bit louder
Let's get a little bit
Let's get a little bit louder
Let's get a little bit louder
Gotta get a little bit louder
Let's get a little bit[Chorus]
Turn it up, let's just see how high we can go
Turn it up, no stopping 'til we lose all control
Turn it up, until we feel it down in our soul
Turn it up, up
Turn it up, let's just see how high we can go
Turn it up, no stopping 'til we lose all control
Turn it up, until we feel it down in our soul
Turn it up, up
Turn it up, let's just see how high we can go
Turn it up, no stopping 'til we lose all control
Turn it up, until we feel it down in our soul
Turn it up, up
