To Him who always loves us
Who once and for all freed us
Whose blood has washed our sins away
And brought us into light of day
To Him be the glory
To Him be the power
To Him be the majesty
And the dominion forever
Oh praise the Ever-living One!
The One who was, and is, and is to come!
The firstborn from among the dead
Almighty and Omnipotent
Oh see Him coming with the clouds!
Every tribe on earth will weep aloud!
Before the One who is the First and Last
Every knee will bow and tongue confess
