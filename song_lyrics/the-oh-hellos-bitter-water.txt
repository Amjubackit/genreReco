[Refrain]
Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh
[Verse 1]
Oh fair and flighty love
My aerolite above
The only dove I see
Could you love me more
If by the sun and moon I swore
That I would never flee?
[Chorus1]
I still taste you on my lips
Lovely bitter water
The terrible fire of old regret is honey on my tongue
And I know I shouldn't love you
I know I shouldn't love you but I do
[Refrain]
Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh
[Verse 2]
I feel it in my soul
I feel the empty hole
The cup that canâ€™t be filled
And I feel it in my blood
In the fire and the flood
The beast that can't be killed[Chorus 2]
Even now you mark my steps
Lovely bitter water
All the days of our delights are poison in my veins
I know I shouldn't love you
I know
[Interlude]
[Refrain]
Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh
[Chorus 3]
I am not a fool entire
No, I know what is coming
You'll bury me beneath the tree I climbed
When I was a child
I know I shouldn't love you
I know I shouldn't love you but I do
