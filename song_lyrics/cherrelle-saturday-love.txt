[Intro: Cherrelle]
It's been a long time
I didn't think I was going to see you again
I see you haven't changed
It's good to see you anyway
[Chorus x2:]
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday love
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday love
[Verse 1: Cherrelle]
When I think about you
My feelings can't explain
Why after all this time
My heart still feels pain
[Hook:]
When I look at you
Memories of love
Like no one before
You stay on my mind
(Special feelings, special time)
Always so special
(I was yours and you were mine)
Made for each other
(All the good I won't forget)
You will stay on my mind
(Saturday, the day we met)
For always
And forever
You will be my Saturday love
[Repeat Chorus:]
[Verse 2: Alexander O'Neal:]
When I think about you
My feelings can't explain
Why after all this time
My heart still feels pain
[Hook:]
When I look at you
Memories of love
Like no one before
You stay on my mind
(Special feelings, special times)
Feeling so special
(I was yours and you were mine)
Made for each other, girl
(All the good I won't forget)
Staying on my mind, girl
(Saturday, the day we met)
Girl, you know I can't leave you behind
There's never any question
You will be my Saturday love
[Repeat Chorus:]
[Cherrelle:]
When I look at you
Special feelings, special times
I thought we'd always be together
But sometimes things just
Don't work out like we planned
Life goes on and people grow
Out of things
That fit before
But Saturday remains the same
And I hope it'll never change
[Bridge: Cherrelle and Alexander O'Neal]
For always and forever
You will be my (you will be my)
You will be my (you will be my)
You will be my (you will be my)
Be (be my Saturday love)
My Saturday love
[Cherrelle:]
Do do do do
Let's sing it together
[Cherrelle and Alexander O'Neal:]
Never on Sunday
Monday's too soon
Tuesday and Wednesday
Just won't do
Thursday and Friday
We can begin
But our Saturday love
Will never end, sugar
