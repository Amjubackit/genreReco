[Verse 1]
This is how it’s gonna be
This is what you’ll think of me
It’s going down like I told you
This is how it’s gonna be
[Verse 2]
I’ll be the last man standing here
I’m not going anywhere
It’s going down like I told you
I’ll be the last man standing here
[Pre-Chorus]
What you gonna do? I’m gonna rock you
What you gonna do? I’m gonna rock you
What you gonna do? I’m gonna rock you
I’ll have you beggin’ for mercy, beggin for mercy, oh!
[Chorus]
I’m dangerous, so dangerous
I’m dangerous, so dangerous
[Verse 3]
I’m the baddest mother up in here
And I’m about to make it clear
It’s going down like I told you
I’m the baddest mother up in here[Pre-Chorus]
What you gonna do? I’m gonna rock you
What you gonna do? I’m gonna rock you
What you gonna do? I’m gonna rock you
I’ll have you beggin’ for mercy, beggin for mercy, oh!
[Chorus]
I’m dangerous, so dangerous
I’m dangerous, so dangerous
I'm dangerous!
[Breakdown]
Get ready 'cause here I come
I’m about to come and get me some
Hot as smoking gun
So get ready cause here I come
[Pre-Chorus]
What you gonna do? I’m gonna rock you
What you gonna do? I’m gonna rock you
What you gonna do? I’m gonna rock you
I’ll have you beggin’ for mercy, beggin for mercy, ohhh!
[Chorus]
I’m dangerous, so dangerous
I’m dangerous, so dangerous
