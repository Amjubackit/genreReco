[Verse 1]
If I could give this all back
I would be home in the morning
I'd wake up in a cold sweat
Take a flight back to the city I was born in
And I would wipe myself clean
Of what I knew was unimportant
I'd want typical things
I'd try to fit back into all my old clothing
[Pre-Chorus]
And I would prove myself wrong
That all along, the problem was me
With all my bitterness gone
Happy, I'd be
[Chorus]
I'll move back home forever, I'll feed the dogs
And I'll put all my pieces back together
Where they belong, and I'll say
"I'm a mess, I'm a mess, oh God, I'm a mess"
And I'll take 89 to Boston, see my love
And I'll help her set up her new apartment
And we'll get drunk, and she'll say
"Shit, you're a mess, you're a mess, good God, you're a mess
Oh, you're a mess, you're a mess, good God"[Verse 2]
So I paid off my debts, but I found the world boring
So I called my old friends, but they only ever ask me how tour is
And there's still weight on my back, I just try to ignore it
I guess the stage was my mask
I forgot the way I looked before I wore it
[Pre-Chorus]
And I would prove myself wrong
That all along, the problem was me
With all my bitterness gone
Happy, I'll be
[Chorus]
I'll move back home forever, I'll feed the dogs
And I'll put all my pieces back together
Where they belong, and I'll say
"I'm a mess, I'm a mess, oh God, I'm a mess"
And I'll take 89 to Boston, see my love
And I'll help her set up her new apartment
And we'll get drunk, and she'll say
"Shit, you're a mess, you're a mess, good God, you're a mess
Oh, you're a mess, you're a mess"
[Bridge]
That's not what I had hoped
Now I find comfort in the cold[Chorus]
I'll move back home forever, I'll feed the dogs
And I'll put all my pieces back together
Where they belong, and I'll say
"I'm a mess, I'm a mess, oh God, I'm a mess"
And I'll take 89 to Boston, see my love
And I'll help her set up her new apartment
And we'll get drunk, and she'll say
"Shit, you're a mess, you're a mess, good God, you're a mess
Oh, you're a mess, you're a mess, good God"
