[Intro]
From the cradle bars comes a beckoning voice
It sends you spinning, you have no choice
[Verse 1]
You hear a laughter cracking through the walls
It sends you spinning, you have no choice
You hear a laughter cracking through the walls
It sends you spinning, you have no choice
[Chorus]
Following the footsteps of a rag doll dance
We are entranced; spellbound
Following the footsteps of a rag doll dance
We are entranced; spellbound
Spellbound, spellbound, ooh-ooh
Spellbound, spellbound, spellbound, spellbound
[Verse 2]
And don't forget when your elders forget
To say their prayers
Take them by the legs
And throw them down the stairs
When you think your toys have gone berserk
It's an illusion, you cannot shirk
You hear a laughter cracking through the walls
It sends you spinning, you have no choice
[Chorus]
Following the footsteps of a rag doll dance
We are entranced; spellbound
Following the footsteps of a rag doll dance
We are entranced; spellbound
Spellbound, spellbound, ooh-ooh
Spellbound, spellbound, spellbound, spellbound
[Outro]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Following the footsteps of a rag doll dance
We are entranced
Following the footsteps of a rag doll dance
We are entranced
Entranced, entranced
Entranced, entranced
Entranced, entranced
