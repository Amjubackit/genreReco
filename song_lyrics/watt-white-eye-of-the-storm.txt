*whistling and background thunder sounds*
I
Am the eye of the storm
Inside
I am silent and strong
Just waitin for the right (right) moment to strike
Coiled like a cobra
I! oh-oh-oh-oh-oh(x3)
I am the eye of the storm
Wind (wind) howling in my face
Tearing up the asphalt
Imma getting up in my place
Run (run) nowhere left to hide
I must take a stand now
Find the strength inside!
Wel-come to the vortex
Absolute ground zero of my heart
Pi-ni-cle of the apex
Nothin's gonna tear my soul apart
I
Am the eye of the storm
Inside
I am silent and strong
Just waitin for the right (right) moment to strike
Coiled like a cobra coming to life
