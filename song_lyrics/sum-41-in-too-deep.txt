[Verse 1]
The faster we're fallin', we're stoppin' and stallin'
We're runnin' in circles again
Just as things were lookin' up, you said it wasn't good enough
But still, we're tryin' one more time
[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe we're just tryin' too hard
When really, it's closer than it is too far
[Chorus]
'Cause I'm in too deep, and I'm tryin' to keep
Up above in my head, instead of goin' under
'Cause I'm in too deep, and I'm tryin' to keep
Up above in my head, instead of goin' under
'Stead of goin' under
[Verse 2]
Seems like each time I'm with you, I lose my mind
Because I'm bendin' over backwards to relate
It's one thing to complain, but when you're drivin' me insane
Well then I think it's time that we took a break
[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe we're just tryin' too hard
When really, it's closer than it is too far
