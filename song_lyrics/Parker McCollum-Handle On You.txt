[Verse 1]
I went and bought the biggest bottle they got 'cause you're gone
Drop a needle on a vinyl and cry to an old Haggard song
Sittin' at the table, baby breakin' the seal
Gonna see how much of this pain I can kill
I went and bought the biggest bottle they got 'cause you're gone
[Chorus]
Tennessee and Kentucky
'Cause you ain't here to love me
I drink now that there's nothing to lose
I've been fightin' with your memory
I hate the way it hits me
I wake up everyday black and blue
After all this back and forth, a fifth won't do
Yeah, I finally got a handle, finally got a handle on you
[Verse 2]
I tell myself that I should quit but I don't listen to drunks
I keep on sippin' 'til "I miss you" don't roll off my tongue
Since you poured our love down the sink
I think I'll just stay here and drink
I tell myself that I should quit but I don't listen to drunks
[Chorus]
Tennessee and Kentucky
'Cause you ain't here to love me
I drink now that there's nothing to lose
I've been fightin' with your memory
I hate the way it hits me
I wake up everyday black and blue
After all this back and forth, a fifth won't do
Well, I finally got a handle on you
