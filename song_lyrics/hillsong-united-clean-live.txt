[Verse 1]
Precious blood has left me forgiven
Pure like the whitest of snow
Powerful to make sin and shame retreat
This covenant is making me whole
[Chorus 1]
So I will rise and lift my head
For by His mercy my life was spared
The highest name has set me free
Because of Jesus
My heart is clean
[Verse 2]
Purify my heart in Your presence
Teach me to discover the joy
Of holiness that forms as You draw me close
In You what was lost is restored
[Chorus 2]
So I will rise and lift my head
For by His mercy my life was spared
The highest name has set me free
Because of Jesus
My heart is clean
So I will rise and lift my head
For by His mercy my life was spared
The highest name has set me free
Because of Jesus
My heart is clean
Because of Jesus
My heart is clean
