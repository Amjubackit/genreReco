[Verse 1]
My house in Budapest, my
My hidden treasure chest
Golden grand piano
My beautiful castillo
[Refrain]
You, ooh, you, ooh
I'd leave it all
[Verse 2]
My acres of a land
I have achieved
It may be hard for you to
Stop and believe
[Refrain]
But for you, ooh, you, ooh
I'd leave it all
Oh, for you, ooh, you, ooh
I'd leave it all
[Chorus]
And give me one good reason why I should never make a change
And, baby, if you hold me, then all of this will go away
