[Verse 1]
Don’t play that song for me
Cause it brings back memories
Of days that I once knew
The days that I spent with you
Oh no! Don’t let them play it (Oh no!)
It fills my heart with pain (It hurts!)
Please stop it right away
'Cause I remember just a' what he said
[Chorus]
He said, darling (Darling I, I love you)
And I know that he lied (Darling I, I love you)
You know that you lied (Darling I, I love you)
You know that you lied (You lied)
Lied (You lied)
You lied (To me)
[Verse 2]
Hey mister, don’t play it no more
Don’t play it no more
I can’t stand it
Don’t play it no more (No more)
No more (No more)
No more (Can't stand it)
I remember on our first date
He kissed me and he walked away
I was only seventeen
I never dreamed he'd be so mean
