[Intro]
Say you won't leave me (Won't leave me)
But I need you always
[Verse 1]
It's unconditional, I'll never leave you confused
'Cause I'm always forgivin' the shit you be puttin' me through
When you told me you changed but I see it ain't nothin' new, huh
'Cause I already knew you don't know nothin' 'bout love (Love)
I leave when you're wrong, but don't stay away for long
You make it so hard in making this house a home
[Pre-Chorus]
I know you're no good, but I just keep hanging on to toxicity
And you know you could do better, baby, but you won't try for me, no
[Chorus]
You know I can't leave you
But I swear that I would if I could (Could)
And I hate that I need you (Hate it 'cause you know I need you, baby)
When you know how to hurt me so good (Yeah, you hurt me so good)
[Verse 2]
Said I'm tired, and I'm worn
'Cause we go back and forth
And you break me down but you show no remorse
Mm, and I'm losin' the war
'Cause you don't know nothin' 'bout love
And I'm just a shadow of all that I was (I was)
