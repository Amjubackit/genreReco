[Verse 1]
In your ribs
I see more than bones
Something lost
I had long ago
All the words
Are meaning so much more
As you say them
Without a clause
[Chorus]
Now I'm letting all you in
You caught me falling
Now I'm letting all you in
You caught me falling
[Verse 2]
In white water
An open hand
You found my wreck
In pieces there
And all my resin
Glowing red
Could turn to amber
I will still be there
[Chorus]
Now I'm letting all you in
You caught me falling
Now I'm letting all you in
You caught me falling
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
Now I'm letting all you in
You caught me falling
Now I'm letting all you in
You caught me falling
