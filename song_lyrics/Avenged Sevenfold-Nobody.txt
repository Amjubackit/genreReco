[Verse 1]
Ride in the shadows wandering beyond the frame
Float like a feather through space and time outside a dream
Pirouette with divinity in a dance we've shared before
"Someone dissolution"
This is "I am all" as "I am none"
Here we fly so high, no, I, no coming down
[Pre-Chorus]
Shedding weight as I'm coming undone
All that's left converging as one
I am the sun
I am the sun
[Chorus]
I'm a God, I'm awake, I'm the one in everything
I'm alive, I'm the dead,
 
I'm a man without a head
[Bridge]
(I'm a God, I'm awake, I'm the one in everything)
I walk with death in final exhalation
And come apart through violent separation
A thousand floors ascend 
into the ether
A lunatic enchanted by the reaper
(I'm alive, I'm the dead, I'm a man without a head)
And down below I leave a stranger laying lifeless
 as the light begins to shatter the skies
I ascend and leave behind the "used to be"
And tear the fabric worn to cover my eyes and see
I see
