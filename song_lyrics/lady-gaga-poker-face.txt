[Verse 1]
I wanna hold 'em like they do in Texas, please (Woo)
Fold 'em, 
let 'em hit me, raise it, baby, stay with me (I love it)
LoveGame intuition, play the cards with spades to start
And after he's been hooked, I'll play the one that's on his heart
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, woah-oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I'll get him hot, show him what I've got
Oh, woah-oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I'll get him hot, show him what I've got
[Chorus]
Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face
(She's got me like nobody)
Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face
(She's got me like nobody)
