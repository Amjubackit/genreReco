[Verse 1]
I know I'd go from rags to riches
If you would only say you care
And though my pocket may be empty
I'd be a millionaire
[Verse 2]
My clothes may still be torn and tattered
But in my heart, I'd be a king
Your love is all that ever mattered
It's everything
[Pre-Chorus]
So open your arms and you'll open the door
To every treasure, that I'm hoping for
Hold me and kiss me and tell me you're mine evermore
[Chorus]
Must I forever be a beggar
Whose golden drеams will not come true
Or will I go from rags to riches
My fatе is up to you
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
Must I forever be a beggar
Whose golden dreams will not come true
Or will I go from rags to riches
My fate is up to you
