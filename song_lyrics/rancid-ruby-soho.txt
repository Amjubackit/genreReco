[Verse 1: Tim Armstrong]
Echoes of reggae
Comin' through my bedroom wall
Havin' a party up next door
But I'm sittin' here all alone
Two lovers in the bedroom
And the other started to shout
All I got is this blank stare
And that don't carry no clout at all
Go
[Chorus]
Destination unknown
Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, Ruby Soho
Destination unknown
Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, Ruby Soho
[Verse 2: Tim Armstrong]
He's singin'
And she's there to lend a hand
He's seen his name on the marquee
But she will never understand
Once again he's leavin'
And she's there with a tear in her eye
Embraces with a warm gesture, it's time
Time to say goodbye
[Chorus]
Destination unknown
Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, Ruby Soho
Destination unknown
Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, Ruby Soho
[Interlude]
[Verse 3: Tim Armstrong]
Ruby's heart ain't beatin'
'Cause she knows the feelin' is gone
She's not the only one who knew that
There's somethin' wrong
Her lover's in the distance
As she wipes a tear from her eye
Ruby's fadin' out, she disappears
It's time, time to say goodbye
[Chorus]
Destination unknown
Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, Ruby Soho
Destination unknown
Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, Ruby Soho
[Bridge]
Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, Ruby Soho
Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, Ruby Soho
Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, Ruby Soho
Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, Ruby Soho
[Outro]
(Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, Ruby Soho) Destination unknown
Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, Ruby Soho
(Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, Ruby Soho) Destination unknown
Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, Ruby Soho
