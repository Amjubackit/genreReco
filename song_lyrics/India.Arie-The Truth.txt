Song:"The Truth"
Artist:India.Arie
C.D.:"Voyage To India"
Spoken : Let me tell you why I love him
[Chorus]
Cause he is the truth, said he is so real
And I love the way that he makes me feel
And if I am a reflection of him then I must be fly Because his light it shines so bright I wouldn't lie
Verse 1:
I remember the very first day that I saw him
I found myself immediately intrigued by him
It's almost like I knew this man from another life
Like back then maybe I was his husband maybe he was my wife
And even,things I don't like about him are fine with me
Cause it's not hard for me to understand him cause he's so much like me
And it's truly my pleasure to share his company
And I know that it's God's gift to breathe
The air he breathes
[Chorus]
Cause he is the truth, said he is so real
And I love the way that he makes me feel
And if I am a reflection of him then I must be fly Because his light it shines so bright I wouldn't lie (no)
