[Intro]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
[Verse 1]
B-B-Be careful making wishes in the dark, dark
Can't be sure when they've hit their mark
And besides in the mean-meantime, I'm just
Dreaming of tearing you apart
I'm in the de-details with the devil
You know, the world can never get me on my level
I just gotta get you out the cage, I'm a young lover's rage
Gonna need a spark to ignite
[Pre-Chorus]
But my songs know what you did in the dark
[Chorus]
So light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
I'm on fire
So light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
I'm on fire
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
In the dark, dark
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
In the dark, dark
