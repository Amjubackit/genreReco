[Intro: Michael Jackson]
Hee-hee-hee-hee!
[Verse 1: Michael Jackson]
My baby's always dancin' and it wouldn't be a bad thing
But I don't get no lovin' and that's no lie
We spent the night in Frisco
 
at every kinda disco
From that night I kissed our love goodbye
[Hook: The Jacksons]
Don't blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie
Don't blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie
[Verse 2: Michael Jackson]
That nasty boogie bugs me, but somehow it has drugged me
Spellbound rhythm gets me on my feet
I've changed my life completely, I've seen the lightning leave me
And my baby just can't take her eyes off me
[Hook: The Jacksons]
Don't blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie
 (Woo!)
Don't you blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie
