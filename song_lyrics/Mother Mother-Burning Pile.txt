[Verse 1]
All my style, all my grace
All I tried to save my face
All my guts, try to spill
All my holes, try to fill
All my money been a long time spent
On my drugs, on my rent
On my saving philosophy
It goes one in the bank and the rest for me
[Chorus]
It goes, all my troubles on a burning pile
All lit up and I start to smile
If I catch fire then I'll change my aim
Throw my troubles at the pearly gates
[Post-Chorus]
Ohh...
Oh oh-oh, oh oh oh-oh oh
(Oh oh oh)
[Verse 2]
My momma, lonely maid
Got her buns in the oven, and she never got laid
My papa, renaissance man
Sailed away and he never came back again
