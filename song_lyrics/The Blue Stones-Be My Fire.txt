[Verse 1]
Baby, be my fire
Baby, be my flame
Baby, be the softly-burning embers
Through December until June calls your name
Baby, be my conjurer
And I'll hold you dear
Baby, be the visions in the night
And wait 'til morning light for you to disappear
[Chorus]
Baby, be my fire
Baby, be my fire
Baby, be my fire
Woah, be my flame
[Verse 2]
Well, I heard you whisper
To all your friends
I heard you telling them that
You need a man in who
You can depend
Well, I'd be the gasoline
To keep you alight
And I'd be the coal so unbreakable
We'd burn together straight through the night
And that's alright
