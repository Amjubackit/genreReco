[Verse 1]
Honey, honey, get the kids in the car now
Put the cash in the trunk, get the keys, let's go
Hit the biggest bank in Chicago
For all it had, we're thieves you know
Remember the thing that I told ya'
Three years, two moons ago?
I promise I’ll be right behind you
But you’re gonna die if you don’t hit the road
[Chorus]
Keep your lights down, keep your voice down low
Wear your hair down, whichever way you go
And I’ll meet you in Idaho
[Verse 2]
Three kids in the back of a Caddy
She said, "Come here and kiss your wife"
And I know you’re real mad at me
But you’re on your way to some kind of life
Daniel, John, and Abby
Promise me you’ll treat your mother nice
[Chorus]
Keep your lights down, keep your voice down low
Wear your hair down, whichever way you go
And I’ll meet you in Idaho
[Outro]
I know you’ll miss me, I’m barely fifty
Ain't comin' with me are all the debts I owe
You don’t have to kiss me, just bear with me
And I'll be back someday I hope
I know you’ll miss me, I’m barely fifty
Ain't comin' with me are all the debts I owe
You don’t have to kiss me, just bear with me
And I'll be back someday I hope
Oh, I hope
Oh, oh, oh, I hope
