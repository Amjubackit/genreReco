[Verse 1]
Journey sets sail, waterways
Cross the Moon and verse the days
The lows and news of all things be
Sunlight garden, low red blossoms
Moon tides of the sea
When struggling for the magic grain
We throw life to the winds like rain
For goodness sake, spare your failings and take
The ability to strengthen your spirit can stimulate all minds
Blossoms of days to come
Blossoms of days to come
[Chorus]
Move away from your western guns
Travel towards eastern suns
Far above all earthly goals
A pledge for creation's soul
[Verse 2]
Spirit finds fresh morning in the dew of precious things
Hope is a phoenix spreading wings to fly
And what we wish shall be like a breath of fresh air
Stay from secret powers and no look can snare
[Chorus]
Move away from your western guns
Travel towards eastern suns
Far above all earthly goals
A pledge for creation's soul
Far above all earthly goals
A pledge for creation's soul
