I want a little of something more
Don't want the middle or the one before
I don't desire a complicated past
I want a love that will last
Say that you love me, say I'm the one
Don't kiss and hug me, and then try to run
I don't do drama, my tears don't fall fast
I want a love that will last
Chorus:
I don't want just a memory, give me forever
Don't even think about saying goodbye
Cuz I just want one love to be enough
And remain in my heart till i die
So..
Call me romantic, I guess that is so
There's something more that you oughta know
No I'll never leave you, so don't even ask
I want a love that will last...Forever
I want a love that will last
(Instrumental)
Chorus:
I don't want just a memory, give me forever
Don't even think about saying goodbye
Cuz I just want one love to be enough
And remain in my heart till I die
So..
There's just a little, more that I need (more that I need)
I wanna share all, the air that you'll breathe
I'm not the kind of girl to complicate the past
I want a love that will last..forever
I want a love that will last...always
I just want a love that will last
I want a love that will last
