I'm lying on my side and I'm wondering
When will it all collape
I'm lying to myself
If I said that I'm never coming back
Can't remember all the things that you said
Or the reasons why I left
But now this room is spinning
While I'm trying just to fill in all the gaps
[Pre-Chorus]
You're so used to walking away
And I'm left here on my own
I never listen to what they say
But you're already gone
Yeah you're already gone
You're already gone
You're already gone
You're gone, you're gone
[Chorus]
Lying on my side and I'm wondering
When will it all collapse
You're gone, you're gone
Lying on my side and I'm wondering when will it all collapse
I lie here on my own when you're gone
But you're never coming back
And every time I'm down and out
I think of what we had
So now I'm driving round in circles trying to fill in all the gaps[Pre-Chorus]
You're so used to walking away
And I'm left here on my own
I never listen to what they say
But you're already gone
Yeah you're already gone
You're already gone
You're already gone
You're gone, you're gone
[Chorus]
Lying on my side and I'm wondering
When will it all collapse
You're gone, you're gone
