[Chorus]
Yeah, baby, you know I want to
Crush you
No matter where you are (Mm-mmm)
Hey baby, you know I want to (Don't you know)
Crush you
No matter where you are
[Verse 1]
Darling it's apparent
The nature of your words
I open up a sacred
And filled it with the words
And even in the basement, we seem to find the simple light
Your touch is quite a statement
Speak of what you like (Do it right, lady)
[Chorus]
Yeah, baby, you know I want to
Crush you
No matter where you are (Where you are)
Hey baby, you know I want to (Hey baby)
Crush you
No matter wherе you are (Where you arе)
[Bridge]
Sleep is for the birds, it's worth it to stay up in the playroom
Everything we need (Everything we need)
Is right within the room (Right within the room)
It's easy when you have it
I've seen it done, through and through
Reach before it happens
It's all yours (All yours)
[Chorus]
Yeah, baby, you know I want to (Do what you will do)
Crush you
No matter where you are (Where you are, baby)
Hey baby, you know I want to (Don't you know)
Crush you
No matter where you are (Where you are)
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
Yeah, baby, you know I want to
Crush you
No matter where you are (Where you are)
Hey baby, you know I want to (Don't you know)
Crush you
No matter where you are (Where you are)
[Refrain]
Crush you
Crush you
Crush you
Crush you
Crush you
Crush you
[Outro]
