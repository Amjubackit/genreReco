I'm the clay and He tha potter
No one hotter, like I live in the oven
To sum it up your life's one chance to show that you love Him
So good, it's understood like I'm under the hammer
So let it drop, talk to 'em Amber
I'm just Aservant, baby
Could've been dead sleeping in my grave
But you said no wouldn't have it that way
Gave me a second chance and I thank you for that
The devil tried to get me but you had my back
Lord you gave your life up just for me
You caused the lame to walk and the blind to see
Could've gave up, any day, but you didn't so all I got to say La la la la la la la, Lord you've been so good
La la la la la la la, Lord you've been so good
La la la la la la la, Lord you've been so good
La la la la la la la, Lord you've been so good
Lord you've been so good
You've had my back when no one would
You picked me up when I was down
I know you'll always be around
Lord you've been so good
You've had my back when no one would
You picked me up when I was down
I know you'll always be around
Just call His name He'll be there Jackson 5 wit it
Every words already spoken closed caption wit it
Braggin' on my God's goodness put some action wit' it
Start to snappin', move your hands, get up n dance, praise and get to clappin' wit it
Actin' like you can't get wit it
Like you tired of prayin' and things happeninin
Like you tired of recievin' what you askin' Him, n
Favor ain't tha fashion, Mel Gibson with my faith
Love Christ wit a passion, singin'
