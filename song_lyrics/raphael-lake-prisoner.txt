[Verse 1]
Closed eyes
Never feel safe
I'm tongue , tied
Never let out my rage
Try to breaking this cage
But where would I go?
I'm stuck , living a life of  bad luck giving me nothing
Doors shut, alone in my head
I'm out of control
[Chorus]
Am I losing my sanity?
I'm over my head
I'm in a dark dream
I'm a prisoner
Here there never let me leave
Losing grip of reality
I'm over the edge
I yell and i scream
I'm a prisoner
Here come get me , set me free[Verse2]
Hurt me , do what you want
I'm thirsty , feeding me bones
Hunger is all that I know
I'm starving for air
Trapped here, sinking in deeper
Cold sweat were from a fever
I'm kept , locked in a box
And nobody cares
[Chorus]
Am I losing my sanity?
I'm over my head
I'm in a dark dream
I'm a prisoner
Here there never let me leave
Losing grip of reality
I'm over the edge
I yell and i scream
I'm a prisoner
Here come get me , set me free[Bridge]
Dark dreams
Every time I close my eyes
Demons coming after me
I'm tired, please
Every time I close my eyes I see them coming after me
This dark dreams
Every time I close my eyes, demons coming after me
I'm tired, please
Every time I close my eyes I see them coming after me
[Chorus]
Am I losing my sanity?
I'm over my head
I'm in a dark dream
I'm a prisoner
Here there never let me leave
Losing grip of me already
I'm over the edge
I yell and i scream
I'm a prisoner
Here come get me , set me free[Outro]
Dark dreams
Every time I close my eyes
Demons coming after me
I'm tired, please
Every time I close my eyes I see them coming after me
