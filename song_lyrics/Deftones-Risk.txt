[Verse 1]
You can't talk, I'm anxious
I'm off the walls
I'm right here just
Come outside and see in
But pack your heart, you might need it
[Chorus]
I'll find a way
I'm confused though
But I think I can try
I will save your life
I will save your life
I'll try for you
[Verse 2]
You're locked up, you exit
You did it before and I seen it
Come outside and breathe in
Relax your arms and let me in
[Chorus]
I'll find a way
I'm confused though
But I think I can try
I will save your life
I will save your life
I'll try for you
