[Intro]
[Verse 1]
I would die for you
I would die for you
I've been dying just to feel you by my side
To know that you're mine
I will cry for you
I will cry for you
I will wash away your pain with all my tears
And drown your fear
[Verse 2]
I will pray for you
I will pray for you
I will sell my soul for something pure and true
Someone like you
[Chorus]
See your face every place that I walk in
Hear your voice every time I am talking
You will believe in me
And I will never be ignored
[Verse 3]
I will burn for you
Feel pain for you
I will twist the knife and bleed my aching heart
And tear it apart
