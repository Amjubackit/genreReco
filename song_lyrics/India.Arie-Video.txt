[Intro]
Mmm, mmm, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah
[Verse 1]
Sometimes I shave my legs and sometimes I don't
Sometimes I comb my hair and sometimes I won't
Depend on how the wind blows, I might even paint my toes
It really just depends on whatever feels good in my soul (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
[Chorus]
I'm not the average girl from your video
 (Oh)
And I ain't built like a supermodel (Oh)
But I learned to love myself unconditionally
Because I am a queen
I not the average girl from your video
My worth is not determined by the price of my clothes
No matter what I'm wearing I will always be
India.Arie
[Verse 2]
When I look in the mirror and the only one there is me
Every freckle on my face is where it's supposed to be, yeah (Haha)
And I know my creator didn't make no mistakes on me
My feet, my thighs, my lips, my eyes, I'm loving what I see (Yeah)
