[Verse 1]
Here I am, not sure you should take a chance
I like playin' dumb, lettin' you figure me out
But I was faded, in my own defense
So, drop a bomb on all the things we dreamed about
[Chorus]
Smash all the guitars
'Til we see all the stars
Oh, got to throw this year away, we got to throw this year away like
A bad luck charm
Smash all the guitars
'Til we see all the stars
Oh, got to throw this year away, we got to throw this year away like
A bad luck charm
[Verse 2]
The trumpets bring the angels, but they never came
And no one let them in 'cause they didn't know my name
I know I keep my feelings so tucked away
Just another day spent hopin' we don't fall apart
So, drop a bomb on all the things we dreamed about
[Chorus]
Smash all the guitars
'Til we see all the stars
Oh, got to throw this year away, we got to throw this year away like
A bad luck charm
Smash all the guitars
'Til we see all the stars
Oh, got to throw this year away, we got to throw this year away like
A bad luck charm
[Bridge]
So let's twist the knife again, twist the knife again
Like we did last summer
Let's twist the knife again, twist the knife again
I'm just tryin' to keep it together
But it gets a little harder when it never gets better
I'm tryin' to keep it together
To keep it together, keep it together, no
[Chorus]
Smash all the guitars
'Til we see all the stars
Oh, got to throw this year away, we got to throw this year away like
A bad luck charm
Smash all the guitars
'Til we see all the stars
Oh, got to throw this year away, we got to throw this year away like
A bad luck charm
