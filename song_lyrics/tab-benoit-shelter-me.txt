The earth can shake the sky come down*
The mountains all fall to the ground
But I will fear none of these things
Shelter me lord underneath your wings
Dark waters rise and thunder pounds
The wheels of war are going round
And all the walls are crumbling
Shelter me lord underneath your wings
Shelter me lord underneath your wings
Hide me underneath your wings
Hide me deep inside your heart
In your refuge - cover me
The world can shake
But lord I'm making you my hiding place
The wind can blow the rain can pour
The deluge breaks the tempest roars
But in the storm my spirit sing
Oh shelter me lord underneath your wing
Shelter me lord underneath your wing
Hide me underneath your wings
Hide me deep inside your heart
In your refuge - cover me
The world can shake
But lord I'm making you my hiding placeNow on the day you call for me
Someday when time - no more shall be
I'll say death where is your sting
Shelter me lord underneath your wing
Shelter me lord underneath your wing
Hide me underneath your wings
Hide me deep inside your heart
In your refuge - cover me
The world can shake
But lord I'm making you my hiding place
Now on the day you call for me
Someday when time - no more shall be
I'll say oh death where is your sting
Oh shelter me lord underneath your wings
I say shelter me lord underneath your wing
Shelter me lord underneath your wing
