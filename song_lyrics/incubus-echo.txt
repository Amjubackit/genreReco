[Verse 1]
There’s something about the look in your eyes
Something I noticed when the light was just right
It reminded me twice that I was alive
And it reminded me that you’re so worth the fight
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Ooh yeah
My biggest fear will be the rescue of me
Strange how it turns out that way, yeah
[Chorus]
Could you show me dear?
Something I've not seen
Something infinitely interesting
Could you show me dear?
Something I've not seen
Something infinitely interesting
[Verse 2]
There’s something about the way you move
I see your mouth in slow motion when you sing
More subtle than something someone contrives
Your movements echo that I've seen the real thing
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Ooh yeah
Your biggest fear will be the rescue of you
Strange how it turns out that way, yeah[Chorus]
Could you show me dear?
Something I've not seen
Something infinitely interesting
Could you show me dear?
Something I've not seen
Something infinitely interesting
[Outro]
Hoo
Ooh yeah
Hoo-ha
