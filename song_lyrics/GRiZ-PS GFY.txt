[Intro]
One, two, three, hook!
{Funk hook}
[Verse 1]
Now who I am
Is exactly who I be
Not good enough for you?
Go ahead and find a better me!
(Uh, yeah!)
Now who you are
Is exactly what I see
That shit is killing my vibe
So go on and let me breathe
[Chorus]
I know you all too well
You talk shit, and love the smell
Don't think that I can't tell
You're fake and nothing else
You should know this well
Ain't trying to wish you ill
Hope this life treats you swell
Oh yeah, P.S. go fuck yourself!
