[Intro]
(Say the word and I'm walking on water)
[Verse 1]
I'd rather slip
Walking on water
Than spend my life
Wondering, "What if?"
Lord, if it's You
Tell me to come
'Cause You alone can tame the wildest wind
[Pre-Chorus]
I know I can make it
'Cause it was Your voice that I heard
So I'm stepping out
I'm stepping out on Your word
[Chorus]
This is how you walk, how you walk on water
One foot in front of the other
Never gonna let you go under
Just put one foot in front of the other
(Okay)
[Verse 2]
I got a faith
Deeper than feelings
'Cause I know a name
That's greater than the storm
I got a God
Who never ever fails me
He's close enough to catch me if I fall
[Pre-Chorus]
I know I can make it
'Cause it was Your voice that I heard
So I'm stepping out
I'm stepping out on Your word
[Chorus]
This is how you walk, how you walk on water
One foot in front of the other (Come on, say what? Hey)
Never gonna let you go under
Just put one foot in front of the other
('Cause this is how you walk)
This is how you walk, how you walk on water
One foot in front of the other
(Never gonna let you go)
Never gonna let you go under (No, no)
Just put one foot in front of the other
('Cause this is how you walk)
This is how you walk, how you walk on water
One foot in front of the other (He's never gonna let you go)
Never gonna let you go under
Just put one foot in front of the other (Hey)
[Bridge]
I'm stepping, I'm stepping out on Your word
I'm stepping, I'm stepping out on Your word
I'm stepping, I'm stepping out on Your word
I'm stepping, I'm stepping out on Your word
I'm stepping, I'm stepping out on Your word (Stepping out)
I'm stepping, I'm stepping out on Your word (Stepping out)
I'm stepping, I'm stepping out on Your word (Stepping out)
I'm stepping, I'm stepping out on Your word (Hey)
[Interlude]
Hey, come on
It go left, right, now walk it out
It go left, right, now walk it out
It go left, right, 'cause this is how you walk
[Chorus]
This is how you walk, how you walk on water
One foot in front of the other
(Never gonna let you go)
Never gonna let you go under (No, no, no)
Just put one foot in front of the other
(This is how you walk)
This is how you walk, how you walk on water
One foot in front of the other
(No, He's never gonna let you go)
Never gonna let you go, let you go under (Hey)
One foot in front of the other
(Let's go)
This is how you walk, how you walk on water
One foot in front of the other
(He's never gonna let you go)
Never gonna let you go under
Just put one foot in front of the other
This is how you walk, how you walk on water
One foot in front of the other
(He's never gonna let you go)
Never gonna let you go under
Just put one foot in front of the other (No, no)
[Outro]
Say the word and I'm walking on water (Say the word)
Say the word (Woo) and I'm walking on water (Say the word)
Say the word (Come on) and I'm walking on water
(One foot in front of the other)
Say the word and I'm walking on water (Hey, just put one foot in front of the other)
Say the word and I'm walking on water (Let me show you, walk on water)
(Let me show you how to walk on water)
Say the word and I'm walking on water (Come on, let me show you, walk on water)
(Let me show you how to walk on water)
