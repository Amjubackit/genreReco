[Intro]
(Say the word and I'm walking on water)
[Verse 1]
I'd rather slip
Walking on water
Than spend my life
Wondering, "What if?"
Lord, if it's You
Tell me to come
'Cause You alone can tame the wildest wind
[Pre-Chorus]
I know I can make it
'Cause it was Your voice that I heard
So I'm stepping out
I'm stepping out on Your word
[Chorus]
This is how you walk, how you walk on water
One foot in front of the other
Never gonna let you go under
Just put one foot in front of the other
(Okay)
[Verse 2]
I got a faith
Deeper than feelings
'Cause I know a name
That's greater than the storm
I got a God
Who never ever fails me
He's close enough to catch me if I fall
