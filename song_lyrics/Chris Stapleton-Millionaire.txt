[Chorus 1]
They say "Love is more precious than gold"
Can't be bought and it can't be sold
I got love, enough to spare
That makes me a millionaire
[Verse 1]
I got a woman with eyes that shine
Down deep, as a diamond mine
She's my treasure, so very rare
She made me a millionaire
[Verse 2]
When we ride around, ride around this old town
In my beat-up car, with the windows down
People look at her and they look at me
And say "That boy is sure livin' in luxury"
Sweet luxury
[Chorus 2]
'Cause love is more precious than gold
It can't be bought no, never could be sold
I got love, enough to share
That makes me a millionaire
[Interlude]
