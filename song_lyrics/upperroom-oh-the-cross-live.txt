[Verse 1]
You carried the Cross upon Your back
Bleeding until Your final breath
Tears of blood, a crown of thorns
You gave it all, our sins You bore
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
There is no greater love
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
There is no greater love
[Chorus]
Oh, the Cross
What You've done
It was more than enough, more than enough
Oh, the Cross
What You've done
The power of Your blood was more than enough
[Verse 2]
The sacrifice that changed history
The nails in Your hands, the hands that saved me
The grave was sealed, death lost its sting
As the Lion roared in victory
The sacrifice that changed history
The nails in Your hands, the hands that saved me
The grave was sealed, death lost its sting
As the Lion roared in victory[Chorus]
Oh, the Cross
What You've done
It was more than enough, more than enough
Oh, the Cross
What You've done
The power of Your blood was more than enough
Oh, the Cross
What You've done
It was more than enough, more than enough
Oh, the Cross
What You've done
The power of Your blood was more than enough
[Bridge]

Thank You
For breaking the bread of Your body

Oh, the Cross
What You've done
It was more than enough, more than enough
Oh, the Cross
What You've done
The power of Your blood was more than enough
Oh, the Cross
What You've done
It was more than enough, more than enough
Oh, the Cross
What You've done
The power of Your blood was more than enough
[Spontaneous]
Ooh I'm covered, I'm covered, I'm covered
Ooh we're covered, we're covered, we're covered in blood
Ooh we're covered, we're covered in this blood
Ohhhh
