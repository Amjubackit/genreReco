[Intro]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
[Verse 1]
Up in your room once again, tempted
Bad for me, it's the truth, but I can't miss this
Don't tell my friends that I'm here to visit
Don't tell my friends that I'm here (Mm-mm-mm, yeah)
[Pre-Chorus]
Waiting for you, even how you treat me
You're my baby even when you leave me
Maybe I'm the one to blame
Maybe I'm the cause of the pain
Waiting for you, even how you treat me
You're my baby even when you leave me
Maybe I'm the problem and the one that's causing all of this
[Chorus]
I can't say "I love you" no more (More)
'Cause my friends gon' judge me for sure
It took some time but I realized
You do me wrong, but it feels right
I can't say "I love you" no more (More)
'Cause my friends gon' judge me for sure
It took some time but I realized
You do me wrong, but it feels right
Feels like I'm stuck on you
(More)
(Sure)
(More)
(Sure)[Verse 2]
Trust me I do understand, this is
Bad for me, I'm a fool, but I can't end it
Far from love, but I'm stuck
Staying while you kiss me, saying that you miss me
Hate it when you tempt me (Oh)
[Pre-Chorus]
Waiting for you, even how you treat me
You're my baby even when you leave me
Maybe I'm the one to blame
Maybe I'm the cause of the pain
Waiting for you, even how you treat me
You're my baby even when you leave me
Maybe I'm the problem and the one that's causing all of this
[Chorus]
I can't say "I love you" no more (No more, more)
'Cause my friends gon' judge me for sure (Sure)
It took some time but I realized
You do me wrong, but it feels right (Oh-oh)
I can't say "I love you" no more (More)
'Cause my friends gon' judge me for sure (I can't)
It took some time but I realized (Oh)
You do me wrong, but it feels right[Outro]
I can't say "I love you" no more
'Cause my friends gon' judge me for sure
It took some time but I realized
You do me wrong, but it feels right
Feels like I'm stuck on you
