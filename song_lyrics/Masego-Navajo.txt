I know you see it, girl
This ain't sittin' real good in my soul
Everywhere this little girl goes
She pick up another obstacle, ah
She was my heart
I don't know the tribe or the fall
But by default she don't think of me

This ain't sittin' real good in my soul
Everywhere this little girl goes
She pick up another obstacle, ah
She was my heart
I don't know the tribe or the fall
But by default she don't think of me
