[Chorus]
Bitch, sit on my face, I attack that
Choose up, lil' junt, I'm finna pack him
When it comes to my bitch, I'm straight active
Dirtball in the coupe smokin' cat piss
Lil' bitch, shut the fuck up
Tell your best friend, shut the fuck up, ayy
Lil' bitch, shut the fuck up
Tell your best friend, shut the fuck up, ayy
[Verse 1]
You know I love it when you talk dirty
Messy, you my orange soda shorty
You act like a lil' me, I wanna fuck you
You the type to kill me, I won't touch you
You want me drop a band on some cute shoes?
You want me be the man you can vent to?
You let me beat it up, you let me practice
Now I'm finna lay you on the mattress
[Chorus]
Bitch, sit on my face, I attack that (Yeah)
Choose up, lil' junt, I'm finna pack him
When it comes to my bitch, I'm straight active
Dirtball in the coupe smokin' cat piss
Lil' bitch, shut the fuck up
Tell your best friend, shut the fuck up, ayy
Lil' bitch, shut the fuck up
Tell your best friend, shut the fuck up, ayy (Ayy, pull up, ayy)
