[Intro: Luke, Joel & Courtney Smallbone & MŌRIAH]

[Verse 1: Joel Smallbone]
I am here, you are there, lying side by side
Out of touch, out of reach in the great divide
Parallel lines, ooh, ooh-ooh
[Verse 2: MŌRIAH]
Hear the rain, count the drops on the window pane
Wide awake, stalemate, why do we play this game?
Oh God, I hate this game
[Pre-Chorus: Joel Smallbone, MŌRIAH & Both]
Throw open the doors
You know my heart is yours
What are we waiting for? Yeah
[Chorus: Joel Smallbone & MŌRIAH]
Let's be pioneers
And we'll build our home
In the great unknown, yeah
Let's be pioneers
[Verse 3: Courtney Smallbone]
There's a song that we sang on our honeymoon
I remember all the words but forgot the tune
Why are we out of tune? Ooh, ooh-ooh
[Verse 4: Luke Smallbone]
Let's forgive and let's forgive again (Ooh)
I'm reaching out to my sweetest friend (Ooh)
Can we start again?
[Pre-Chorus: Luke & Courtney Smallbone]
Throw open the doors
You know my heart is yours
What are we waiting for? Yeah
[Chorus: Luke & Courtney Smallbone, Luke, Joel & Courtney Smallbone & MŌRIAH]
Let's be pioneers
And we'll build our home
In the great unknown, yeah
Let's be pioneers
And we'll build our home
In the great unknown, yeah
Let's be pioneers
Let's be pioneers
