[Verse 1: Thomas Mars]
I'm a high school lover
And you're my favorite flavour
Love is all, all my soul
You're my playground love
[Verse 2: Thomas Mars]
Yet my hands are shaking
I feel my body remains
Time's no matter, I'm on fire
On the playground, love
[Verse 3: Thomas Mars]
You're the piece of gold
That flashes on my soul
Extra time, on the ground
You're my Playground Love
[Verse 4: Thomas Mars]
Anytime, anywhere
You're my Playground Love
