[Intro: MNDR and Kele]
Oh, oh, oh, yay
Oh, oh, oh, yay
Oh, oh, oh, yay (You are golden, you are pure)
Oh, oh, oh, yay (You are golden, you are pure)
[Verse 1: Kele]
Tell me, tell me, tell me your problems
I’m here for you
Just try, just try, just try to stay sober
It’s eating you
And they say you are a monster, but what I see’s a child
Your eyes, your eyes are glowing red
And your tongue has caught on fire
[Pre-Chorus: Kele and MNDR]
You are golden, you are pure (Oh, oh, oh, yay)
You are golden, beautiful (Oh, oh, oh, yay)
[Chorus: MNDR]
So let go, let go of your fire
Let it go, let go of your fire
Live it up ‘til we crash and there’s smoke in the air (Oh, oh, oh, yay)
Let it go, let go of your fire
[Post-Chorus: MNDR]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
[Verse 2: Kele]
You play, you play, you play up to them
But they’re not around
Don’t be, don’t be so rough with me
When you are a gem
[Bridge: Kele]
And they ask how I can love you, when all they see is this
But I see the things that you can’t contain and what it does to you
[Chorus: MNDR]
So let go, let go of your fire
Let it go, let go of your fire
Live it up ‘til we crash and there’s smoke in the air (Oh, oh, oh, yay)
Let it go, let go of your fire
Let go, let go of your fire (Oh, oh, oh, yay)
Let it go, let go of your fire (Oh, oh, oh, yay)
Live it up ‘til we crash and there’s smoke in the air (Oh, oh, oh, yay)
Let it go, let go of your fire (Oh, oh, oh, yay)
[Bridge: MNDR & Kele]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yay
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yay
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yay
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yay
You are golden, you are pure (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yay)
You are golden, pure (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yay)
You are golden, you are pure (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yay)
You are golden, pure (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yay)
[Chorus: MNDR & Kele]
So let go, let go of your fire
Let it go, let go of your fire
Live it up ‘til we crash and there’s smoke in the air
Let it go, let go of your fire (Tell me, tell me, tell me)
Let go, let go of your fire
Let it go, let go of your fire (Tell me, tell me, tell)
Live it up ‘til we crash and there’s smoke in the air
Let it go, let go of your fire (Tell me, tell me, tell me)
[Outro: MNDR]
Oh, oh, oh, yay
Oh, oh, oh, yay
Oh, oh, oh, yay
Oh, oh, oh, yay
