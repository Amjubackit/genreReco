[Verse 1: Sam Claflin]
I've been an angel all summer long
I swear I've done nothing wrong
I want all of your tears to be gone
Come on home
Cape Cod, Santa Fe
A little houseboat in Marina del Rey
So close to get and so far away
Come on home
[Chorus: Riley Keough]
Could the words ever be unspoken?
Could the truth ever untell those lies?
Could a promise ever have been unbroken?
Oh, would it kill you to try?
Give it a try
[Post-Chorus: Sam Claflin]
C'mon
[Verse 2: Sam Claflin]
Don't rip me out of this photograph
Since I found you, I can't stop laughin'
Come on, I need you, babe, you'rе my better half
Come back homе[Bridge: Sam Claflin]
What is it?
What is it I must do?
What is it?
Babe, what is it I must do for you?
Babe, what is it?
What is it I must do?
What is it?
Babe, what is it I must do for you?
[Chorus: Riley Keough]
Show me, I'd blind myself to see it
Call me back to bed with that old lullaby
You've got no damn right to be so damn heartbroken
Boy, it would kill you to try
[Post-Chorus: Riley Keough]
Boy, it would kill you to try
Boy, it would kill you to try
[Breakdown: Sam Claflin]
Could the words ever be unspoken?
Could the truth ever untell the lies?
Can a promise ever be unbroken?
Oh, would it kill you to try?[Outro: Sam Claflin, 
Riley Keough
