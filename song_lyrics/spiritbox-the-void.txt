[Verse 1]
Took a walk to the water at night
No one waits with a light in the dark
'Cause I like to sleep alone
I feel a sense of control in my life
I feel a sense of an infinite lie
Right below the surface
[Pre-Chorus]
Curses lost to an imminent danger
Touch a razor blade to the sky
Like a crutch I need someone to break my
[Chorus]
Fall in
To a place where I belong and
Who can tell me where I
Want to go
Talk to the void and
Fall with me
[Verse 2]
Where do my fears all go when they die?
To a placе untethering a thousand lives bеtween the stone
It's the way that you guide me to the edge
Of a hole that was made for me
I hear the call of the void and surrender up
A piece of my history[Pre-Chorus]
Curses lost to an imminent danger
Touch a razor blade to the sky
Like a crutch I need someone to break my
[Chorus]
Fall in
To a place where I belong and
Who can tell me where I
Want to go
Talk to the void and
Fall with me
[Bridge]
Where do my fears all go when they die?
Where do my fears all go when they die?
Curses lost to an imminent danger
Touch a razor blade to the sky
Like a crutch I need someone to break my
[Chorus]
Fall in
To a place where I belong and
Who can tell me where I
Want to go (but it’s too close)
Talk to the void and (and it’s too late)
Fall with me (this time)
With me
