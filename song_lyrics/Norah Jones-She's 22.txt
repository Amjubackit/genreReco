[Verse 1]
She's 22 and she's loving you
And you'll never know how it makes me blue
Does it make you happy?
I'm holding on to the thing that's wrong
'Cause we don't belong
But you like my songs
And you make me happy
Does she make you happy?
[Chorus]
You can throw away
Every word I say
[Verse 2]
I'm standing still on this hidden hill
And I'm looking around for the right way down
To your distant valley
Your flowers grow in the frozen snow
And I'd like to know if it's all a show
'Cause you sure look happy
Are you really happy?
[Chorus]
You'll just throw away
Every word I say
You can throw away
