[Verse 1]
I need you baby
More than you'll ever, ever know
What keeps you waiting?
Let's take our time just moving slow
[Pre-Chorus 1]
I'm so lonely, feeling heavy love
You're just so far from where I want you now
[Chorus]
Come on now, baby
You speak so soft and low
Come on now, baby
You think that I don't know
I need some honey
Come on now, baby
[Verse 2]
What if I told you
That there's a fight on every corner
They'll keep you wavering
Until you've reached some modern low
It's not just lazy
There's just some things you're never told
[Pre-Chorus 2]
It can't always be this heavy love
We'll have to wear our fears so everyone
Can see it too
[Chorus]
Come on now, baby
You speak so soft and low
Come on now, baby
You think that I don't know
I need some honey
Come on now, baby
[Outro]
I need you baby
More than you'll ever, ever know
Oh, yeah
