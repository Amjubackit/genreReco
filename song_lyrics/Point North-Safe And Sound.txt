[Verse 1: Point North]
It's been quiet in my mind
Now I'm paranoid
It's just a matter of time before it's making noise
It's like an hourglass I can't turn over
And when it's out, it comes down like a mortar
[Pre-Chorus: Point North]
I know you think I'm always in control
But it's hard for me to let things go
There's nothing left to talk about
Now you got me thinking how
[Chorus: Point North]
I've been getting bad news, all night
Swinging in a safe place, that's where I try
You'll never get a chance to rewind
You say that you care but don't
I need an antidote
When safe and sound comes burning down
I've been getting bad news, all night
Letting go of high hopes that just died (Die)
[Verse 2: Point North]
You seem to love it whеn you drag me down
You're concretе on my feet, I drown
Yeah, breathing's kinda hard
'Cause I'm sinking in the dark
And you're not gonna pull me out
