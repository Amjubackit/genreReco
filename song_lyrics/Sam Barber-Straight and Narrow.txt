[Verse 1]
When there's a storm raging in your soul
You gotta thank God that you're still growing old
If them demons your fighting won't go away
Drop on your knees and pray
[Chorus]
Life can get hard sometimes I know
You got to get up and walk the straight and narrow
[Post-Chorus]
When they're chasing you down with an old bloodhound
And you're running through the fields for your life
You got to get up, son, I know they're gunnin' for ya
[Verse 2]
Don't let the thought of yesterday
Crowd out the visions of today
Don't let your past define your name
We will all be judged the same someday
[Chorus]
Life can get hard sometimes I know
You got to get up and walk the straight and narrow
[Post-Chorus]
When they're chasing you down with an old bloodhound
And you're running through the fields for your life
You got to get up son I know they're gunnin' for ya
When they're chasing you down with an old bloodhound
And you're running through the fields for your life
You got to get up son I know they're gunnin' for ya
