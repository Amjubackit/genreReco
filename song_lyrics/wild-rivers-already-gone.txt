I walked out my house tonight just to hear the quiet
Listen to the dark before I lie
Looking to the city lights burning from afar
Glowing at the bottom of the sky
I think nothing beautiful comes without a fight
Of course there's no exception in us
I've come to love revolving doors and things that tend to shine
But you never really cared for that much
Oh, ain't it just a shame
Ending 'bout the same way that we started out
Oh, comin' back around with just more jewelry
I'm afraid that we've departed now
You won't catch me, trains are moving too fast
What's this railcar to some bits of broken glass?
I had a box of pictures that I hid in tall grass
You won't find me ‘cause I'm already gone
You won't find me ‘cause I'm already gone
Well I used to have love, but I was stubborn and drunk
So I squandered it
And I got rid of your taste with some things in a place
Because I wanted it
Oh, ain't it just a shame
Ending 'bout the same way that we started out
Oh, coming back around with just more jewelry
I'm afraid that we've departed now
You won't catch me, trains are moving too fast
What's this railcar to some bits of broken glass?
I had a box of pictures that I hid in tall grass
You won't find me ‘cause I'm already gone
You won't find me ‘cause I'm already gone
I walked out my house tonight just to hear the quiet
Listen to the dark before I lie
