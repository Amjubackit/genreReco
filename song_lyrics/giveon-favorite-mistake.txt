[Verse 1]
Are you on your way?
Are you coming soon to me?
No parking in LA
So I'ma send a Uber to your place
Is my secret safe?
Safe with just you and me
We can't leave a trace
This is my favorite mistake
[Pre-Chorus]
Look in my eyes
Can you find the lies? Do you feel alive?
Look in my eyes
Do you mind the lies? Do you feel alive?
Look in my eyes
[Chorus]
We both know it's wrong
But you're still coming over
Even when you're gone
The feeling just grow stronger
Should leave it alone
But you're still getting closer
We both know it's wrong
Can't keep this for long
While it's going on
I'll put it in a song[Verse 2]
Are you on your way?
Are you coming soon to me?
I'm getting impatient
Look at what you do to me
Our secret's safe so you're my favorite mistake
That's why we gotta keep it on the low (Low)
Girl at home but she don't need to know (Know)
What's going on, it won't be on for long, no
[Pre-Chorus]
Look in my eyes
Can you find the lies?
Do you feel alive?
Look in my eyes
Do you mind the lies?
Do you feel alive?
Look in my eyes
[Chorus]
We both know it's wrong
But you're still coming over
Even when you're gone
The feeling just grow stronger
Should leave it alone
But you're still gettin’ closer
We both know it's wrong
Can't keep this for long
While it's going on
I'll put it in a song
