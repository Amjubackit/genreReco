[Verse 1: SEBASTIAN]
There you see her
Sitting there across the way
She don't got a lot to say
But there's somet'ing about her
And you don't know why
But you're dying to try
You wanna kiss the girl
[Verse 2: SEBASTIAN]
Yes, you want her
Look at her, you know you do
Possible she want you too
Use your words, boy, and ask her
If the time is right and the time is tonight
Go on and kiss the girl
[Chorus: ALL, SCUTTLE, SEBASTIAN]
Sha-la-la-la-la-la, my, oh, my
Look like the boy too shy
Ain't gonna kiss the girl
Sha-la-la-la-la-la, ain't that sad?
Ain't it a shame? Too bad
He gonna miss the girl
Hey, pull it back, Scuttle, pull it back!
[Verse 3: SEBASTIAN, FLOUNDER & SCUTTLE, ALL]
Now's your moment (Ooh)
Floatin' in a blue lagoon (Ooh)
Boy, you better do it soon
No time will be better
She don't say a word
And she won't say a word until ya
Kiss the girl (Kiss the girl, kiss the girl)
[Chorus: ALL, SEBASTIAN, FLOUNDER & SCUTTLE, SCUTTLE]
Sha-la-la-la-la-la, don't be scared (Sha-la-la-la-la-la)
You got the mood prepared (Sha-la-la-la-la-la)
Go on and kiss the girl (Woah, woah)
Sha-la-la-la-la-la, don't stop now (Sha-la-la-la-la-la)
Don't try to hide it (Sha-la)
How you wanna kiss the girl
Sha-la-la-la-la-la, float along (Sha-la-la-la-la-la)
And listen to the song (Sha-la)
The song say, "Kiss the girl"
Sha-la-la-la-la-la, the music play (Sha-la)
Do what the music say
You got to kiss the girl
[Outro: SEBASTIAN, ALL, FLOUNDER, SCUTTLE]
You've gotta kiss the girl
Why don't you kiss the girl
C'mon and kiss the girl
Go on and kiss the girl
