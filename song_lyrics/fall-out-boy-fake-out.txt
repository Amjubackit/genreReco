[Verse 1]
Take a knife and cut through the darkness
Castle-temp red wine
But I make no plans and none can be broken
No plans and none can be broken
Remember us just like this forever
But this can't last, won't last
So make no plans and none can be broken
No plans and none can be broken
[Pre-Chorus]
Do you laugh about me whenever I leave?
Or do I just need more therapy?
[Chorus]
Love is in the air, I just gotta figure out a window to break out
Buried alive insidе my dreams, but it was all a fake-out
And I don't care, I just gotta figurе out a window to break out
Buried alive inside my dreams, but it was all a fake-out, fake-out
[Verse 2]
My mood board is just pictures of you
But I'm not sad anymore
So make no plans and none can be broken
No plans and none can be broken
But I didn't take the love when I had the chance
But I swear I'm not sad anymore
So make no plans and none can be broken
No plans and none can be broken
[Pre-Chorus]
Do you laugh about me whenever I leave?
Or do I still need more therapy?
[Chorus]
Love is in the air, I just gotta figure out a window to break out
Buried alive inside my dreams, but it was all a fake-out
And I don't care, I just gotta figure out a window to break out
Buried alive inside my dreams, but it was all a fake-out, fake-out
[Bridge]
Oh, we all started off as shiny dimes
But we all got flipped too many times
We did it for futures that never came
And for pasts that we're never gonna change
[Chorus]
Love is in the air, I just gotta figure out a window to break out
Buried alive inside my dreams, but it was all a fake-out
And I don't care, I just gotta figure out a window to break out
Buried alive inside my dreams, but it was all a fake-out, fake-out
