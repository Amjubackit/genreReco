[Intro]
(
C-World
)
Yo, fuck you, Serena, you're a bitch
 (Shh)
[Chorus]
Fuck niggas always tryna take my shit
How you gon' feel when I go take your bitch, nigga?
And I don't mean your chick
Bitches these days are so sensitive
[Verse 1]
You walk that walk talking blah, blah, blah
Who you think run your block?
The government, the opps, your enemies
Gotta eat, gotta get money by any means
I'm switching up, I'm a boss, I'm getting mean
She wanna be with a boss with royalty, yeah
I lay her down in my BDG ripped jeans
I laid it, now she's addicted, a fuckin' fiend
She got around, now she fucking the whole squad (Whole squad)
That pussy lookin' like the sign of the cross, on God
Leaning to the side, it's spilling water
Smashed then passed
[Chorus]
Fuck niggas always tryna take my shit
How you gon' feel when I go take your bitch, nigga?
And I don't mean your chick
Bitches these days are so sensitive
Niggas always tryna take my shit
How you gon' feel when I go take your bitch, nigga?
And I don't mean your chick
Bitches these days are so sensitive[Verse 2]
I'd never sell out for a check, you stupid motherfucka
I'll buy a house and on my own, I put that on my mother
My babe's gon' rock 
Christian Dior
, I put that on my lover
My babe’s in school, he is so pure, golden
Rose gold all over my arms
Tattoos, I know that he loves it
I know, I know that he loves it
He loves that we are in love
[Bridge]
(Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh)
(Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, woah-oh-oh)
The government or the opps, my enemies
Gotta get this money, I'll do it by any means (Oh-oh)
I need a hundred million dollars to fix these broken streets, yeah
Playing for keeps, they play, playing for keeps (Oh-oh-oh)
The government or the opps, my enemies
Gotta get this money, I'll do it by any means
I need a hundred million dollars to fix these broken streets, uh
Playing for keeps, they play, playing for keeps (Oh-oh-oh)
