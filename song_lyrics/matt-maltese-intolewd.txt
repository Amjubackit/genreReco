[Verse 1]
We took our trousers off, the socialists asleep
We talked and talked for hours, it was really deep
You're a kind of angel, dancing by the table
I was doing fine then I met you
[Verse 2]
I don't need a sign, what will be will be
Let's go start a life somewhere in the weeds
I am usually able, but your effect is fatal
I was doing fine then I met you
I was doing fine but then I met you
