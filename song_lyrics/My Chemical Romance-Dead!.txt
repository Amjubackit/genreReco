[Intro]
Yeah
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 1]
And if your heart stops beating
I'll be here wondering
Did you get what you deserve?
The ending of your life
[Pre-Chorus]
And if you get to Heaven
I'll be here waiting, babe
Did you get what you deserve?
The end, and if your life won't wait
Then your heart can't take this
[Chorus]
Have you heard the news that you're dead?
No one ever had much nice to say
I think they never liked you anyway
Oh, take me from the hospital bed
Wouldn't it be grand? It ain't exactly what you planned
And wouldn't it be great if we were dead?
