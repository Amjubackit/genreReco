[Verse 1]
I'm not afraid
Of the war you've come to wage against my sins
I'm not okay
But I can try my best to just pretend
[Pre-Chorus]
So will you wait me out
Or will you drown me out?
So will you wait me out
Or will you drown me out?
(I have to let you go)
[Chorus]
I can wait for you at the bottom
I can stay away if you want me to
I can wait for years if I gotta
Heaven knows I ain't getting over you
[Verse 2]
I know the pain
That you hide behind the smile on your face
And not a day
Goes by where I don't think I feel the same
[Pre-Chorus]
So will you wait me out
Or will you drown me out?
So will you wait me out
Or will you drown me out?
