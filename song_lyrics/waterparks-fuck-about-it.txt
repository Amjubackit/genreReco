[Verse 1: Awsten Knight]
I like you, but I need some space
I like you kinda far away
It's not hard to kill a day
Lookin' at your face
I like you, but I need some room
Been givin' me your attitude
It doesn't always stay that way
I hate the aftertaste
[Pre-Chorus: Awsten Knight]
I don't wanna leave you hangin' on
But when we fight, it's like a marathon
Give me three days, three days alone, yeah
[Chorus: Awsten Knight]
We can fuck about it later if you want
It's all we ever really do when something's wrong
'Cause you, you don't seem to like it when we talk
I guess I'll see you later, see you later
We can fuck about it later if you want
Because we never fix the problems that we've got
Baby, you don't seem to like it when we talk
I guess I'll see you later, see you later, yeah
[Verse 2: blackbear]
You've been at my crib for like the seventh day up in a row
You've been doin' silly things like checkin' who I follow
I know you waitin' by the phone, but I just wanna be all alone tonight
And it's all right, I won't lie to you
But sometimes, when we fight
It's like scars on my wrist when I think about the shit
That we did to one another, baby
[Chorus: Awsten Knight, Awsten Knight & blackbear]
We can fuck about it later if you want
It's all we ever really do when something's wrong
'Cause you, you don't seem to like it when we talk
I guess I'll see you later, see you later, yeah
We can fuck about it later if you want
Because we never fix the problems that we've got
Baby, you don't seem to like it when we talk
I guess I'll see you later, see you later, yeah
[Post-Chorus: Awsten Knight]
Yeah
[Bridge: Awsten Knight & blackbear, Awsten Knight]
I don't wanna leave you hangin' on
But it's kinda hard to miss who's never gone
Give me three days, three days alone, yeah
[Chorus: Awsten Knight, Awsten Knight & blackbear]
We can fuck about it later if you want
It's all we ever really do when something's wrong (When something's wrong)
'Cause you, you don't seem to like it when we talk
I guess I'll see you later, see you later (Yeah)
We can fuck about it later if you want
Because we never fix the problems that we've got
Baby, you don't seem like it when we talk
I guess I'll see you later, see you later, yeah
[Outro: Awsten Knight]
We can fuck about it later if you want
It's all we ever really do when something's wrong
'Cause you, you don't seem to like it when we talk
I guess I'll see you later, see you later
