[Verse 1]
One Name
Holds weight above them all
His fame
Outlasts the earth He formed
His praise
Resounds beyond the stars
And echoes in our hearts
The greatest One of all
[Verse 2]
His face
Shines brighter than the sun
His grace
As boundless as His love
He reigns
With healing in His wings
The King above all kings
The greatest One of all
[Chorus 1]
Lift up our eyes see the King has come
Light of the world reaching out for us
There is no other Name, there is no other Name
Jesus Christ our God
Seated on high the undefeated One
Mountains bow down as we lift Him up
There is no other Name, there is no other Name
Jesus Christ our God   [Verse 3]
Find hope
When all the world seems lost
Behold
The triumph of the cross
His power
Has trampled death and grave
Our life found in His Name
The greatest Name of all
[Chorus 2]
Lift up our eyes see the King has come
Light of the world reaching out for us
There is no other Name, there is no other Name
Jesus Christ our God
Seated on high the undefeated One
Mountains bow down as we lift Him up
There is no other Name, there is no other Name
Jesus Christ our God
Jesus
[Interlude]
[Bridge]
The earth will shake and tremble before Him
Chains will break, as heaven and earth sing
Holy is the Name, holy is the Name of
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus
The earth will shake and tremble before Him
Chains will break, as heaven and earth sing
Holy is the Name, holy is the Name of
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus[Chorus 2]
Lift up our eyes see the King has come
Light of the world reaching out for us
There is no other Name, there is no other Name
Jesus Christ our God
Seated on high the undefeated One
Mountains bow down as we lift Him up
There is no other Name, there is no other Name
There is no other Name, there is no other Name
Jesus ...
