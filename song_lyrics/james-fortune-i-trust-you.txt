Even though I can’t see
And i can’t feel your touch
I will trust you lord
How I love you so much
Though my nights may seem long
And I feel so alone
Lord my trust is in you
I surrender to you
So many painful thoughts
Travel through my mind
And I wonder how
I will make it through this time
(FIYA)
But i trust you
Lord it’s not easy
Sometimes the pain in my life
Makes you seem far away
But i’ll trust you
I need to know you’re here
Through the tears and the pain
Through the heartache and rain
I’ll trust you
(James)
Oh God I trust You
Sometimes it’s so hard because
Everything that I see
Tells me not to believe
(FIYA)
Everything that i see
Tells me not to believe
But i’ll trust you lord
You have never failed me
My past still controls me
Will this hurt ever leave’
I can only trust you
No one else like you do
So many painful thoughts
Travel through my mind
And I wonder how
I will make it through this time
But i trust you
Lord it’s not easy
Sometimes the pain in my life
Makes you seem far away
But i’ll trust you
I need to know, you’re here
Through the tears and the pain
Through the heartache and rain
Through the tears and the pain
Through the heartache and rain
Through the tears and the pain
Through the heartache and rain
