I remember wearing straight leg Levis, flannel shirts
Even when they weren't in style
I remember singing with Roy Rogers at the movies
When the West was really wild
And I was listening to the Opry
When all of my friends were digging rock n' roll and rhythm and blues
I was country when country wasn't cool
I remember circling the drive-in
Pulling up and turning down George Jones
I remember when no one was looking
I was putting peanuts in my Coke
I took a lot of kidding, 'cause I never did fit in
Now look at everybody trying to be what I was then
I was country when country wasn't cool
I was country when country wasn't cool
I was country from my hat down to my boots
I still act and look the same
What you see ain't nothing new
I was country when country wasn't cool
They call us country bumpkins for sticking to our roots
I'm just glad we're in a country when we're all free to choose
I was country when country wasn't coolHey, I was country when country wasn't cool
Yeah, I was country from my hat down to, whoa, my boots
I still act and look the same
What you see ain't nothing new
I was country when country wasn't cool
Yeah, I was country when country wasn't cool
