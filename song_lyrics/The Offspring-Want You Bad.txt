[Verse 1]
If you could only read my mind
You would know that things between us ain't right
I know your arms are open wide
But you're a little on the straight side, I can't lie
[Pre-Chorus]
Your one vice
Is you're too nice
Come around now, can't you see?
[Chorus]
I want you all tattooed
I want you bad
Complete me, mistreat me
I want you to be bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
[Verse 2]
If you could only read my mind
You would know that I've been waiting so long
For someone almost just like you
But with attitude, I'm waiting, so come on
[Pre-Chorus]
Get out of Clothestime
Grow out those highlights
Come around now, can't you see?
