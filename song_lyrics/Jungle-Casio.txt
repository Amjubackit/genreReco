[Verse 1]
Casio, playing on my heart just like a Casio
Breaking it apart so you can let it go
Wait another year, that's not original
Or cynical, alright, let's go now
[Chorus]
When all your dreams are gone
And you're still holding on
You waited far too long
Don't say I know, you know it's over
[Verse 2]
Play it cool, I just want the keys back to my vehicle
They're just gonna tell you that it wasn't real
And I just wanna tell you this is how I feel
I know you feel, I know you feel it too
[Chorus]
When all your dreams are gone
And you're still holding on
You waited far too long
Don't say I know, you know it's over
[Verse 3]
Casio, playing on my heart just like a Casio
Breaking it apart so you can let it go
Wait another year, that's not original
Or cynical, alright, let's go now
