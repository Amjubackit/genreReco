A sound of Heaven touching earth
A sound of Heaven touching earth

Let this place erupt with praise
Can you hear it
A sound of Heaven touching earth
The sound of Heaven touching earth
Our Father
All of Heaven roars Your name
Sing louder
Let this place erupt with praise
Can you hear it
A sound of Heaven touching earth
A sound of Heaven touching earth
A sound of Heaven touching earth
Our Father
All of Heaven roars Your name
Sing louder
Let this place erupt with praise
Can you hear it
A sound of Heaven touching earth
The sound of Heaven touching earth
A sound of Heaven touching earth

Shaking up the earth and sky

Come on if you want to sing spread your voice in this room
And call out to heaven right here in this room
We need the sound of heaven right here in this room
