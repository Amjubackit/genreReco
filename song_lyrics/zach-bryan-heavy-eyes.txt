[Verse 1]
Remember when David dashed a twelve-pack
Of Budweiser Heavy for the road?
Two kids in the back, drunk off their ass
Screamin' in an old Bronco
[Chorus]
And I recall what she said
That she wanted me dead
There ain't no grave deep enough
Remember all the nights we had
You said it ain't so bad
Just keep those heavy eyes lookin' up
[Verse 2]
Remember when Mary brought her own Jane?
Lucas thought he was gonna die
'Cause stars started fallin' out a night cloud
From a clear, midwestern sky
[Chorus]
I recall what she said
Screamin' that the sky's red
It's burned into a younger man's mind
Remember all the days we had
I say it ain't so bad
Keep those heavy eyes soft and kind
[Post-Chorus]
Oh, when I'm old, I will recall
All the nights we spent outlaws
It's gettin' cold, but that sun is crestin'
And heavy eyes ain't born for restin'
[Instrumental Break]
[Bridge]
Who's gonna drive us home, the boys and me?
Our walkin' staggered, vision blurred
One thing you'll come to know, the boys back home
Live for things like Dead Man's Curve
[Chorus]
I recall what he said
He'd rather be gone and dead
Than living like those sad folks in town
I can't take this soul with me
If I go, I'm goin' quickly
Keep those heavy eyes free and proud
[Post-Chorus]
Oh, when I'm old, I will recall
All the nights we spent outlaws
It's gettin' cold, but that sun is crestin'
And heavy eyes ain't born for restin'
[Instrumental Break]
[Outro]
Oh, when I'm old, I will recall
All the nights we spent outlaws
It's gettin' cold, but that sun is crestin'
And heavy eyes ain't born for restin'
