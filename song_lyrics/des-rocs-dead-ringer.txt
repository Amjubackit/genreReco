[Chorus]
Hold my cigarette while it's lit
And let it burn you, baby
Oh, dead ringer, you so sick
But you look amazing
[Verse 1]
All these voices in the night
Come like a cool summer rain
Know they hangin' for a while
So I let 'em stay, stay, stay, stay, stay
[Verse 2]
Oh, all these faces in the night
Lookin' like television saints
With their names in big bright lights
All they do is take, take, take, take, take
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, lady
I got my hand on the trigger
And it's pointed at the dead ringer
[Chorus]
Hold my cigarette while it's lit
And let it burn you, baby
Oh, dead ringer, you so sick
But you look amazing
Hold my cigarette while it's lit
And let it burn you, baby
Oh, dead ringer, you so sick
But you look amazing[Verse 3]
Oh, my reflection's from a time
When all the worst was a game
Nothin' like the shake of life
Stuck up in a race, race, race, race, race
[Verse 4]
Hell caught a shadow of a guy
Can't find him one little break
See, there's a gap in his smile
For fittin' all his pain, pain, pain, pain, pain
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, lady
I got my hand on the trigger
And it's pointed at the dead ringer
[Chorus]
Hold my cigarette while it's lit
And let it burn you, baby
Oh, dead ringer, you so sick
But you look amazing
Hold my cigarette while it's lit
And let it burn you, baby
Oh, dead ringer, you so sick
But you look amazing[Bridge]
Yeah, yeah, did you think that he could hurt you?
Yeah, yeah, the dead ringer never meant to
Yeah, yeah, did you think that he could hurt you?
Yeah, yeah, the dead ringer never meant to
[Chorus]
Hold my cigarette while it's lit
And let it burn you, baby
Oh, dead ringer, you so sick
But you look amazing
Hold my cigarette while it's lit
And let it burn you, baby
Oh, dead ringer, you so sick
But you look amazing
[Outro]
Oh, dead ringer, you're so sick
