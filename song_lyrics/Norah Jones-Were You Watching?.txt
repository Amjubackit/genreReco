[Intro]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
[Verse 1]
Were you watching
When I dropped the seeds from the window?
Were you watching
When I built walls from paper and glue?
Were you watching
When the flowers bloomed in the springtime?
Were you watching
Darling, where were you?
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 2]
Were you listening
When there was nothing more to say?
Were you listening
I sang sad songs, anyway
Were you hiding
When our love was in the deepest danger?
Were you watching
As we slowly turned into strangers?
