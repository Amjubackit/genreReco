[Intro]
Ha-ha-ha-ha
No, no, no, no
My mind can't stop racing, it's hard to pretend
You've had your last chance, now it's time for you to go away
[Verse 1]
Do you hear yourself?
With every little word you say, it's always bringing me down
And I'll never see you tonight, it hurts to say
I did you wrong, you know but that's okay
Will you give me a chance? Will you give me the chance?
To say I'm sorry
For what I've done
For what I've done!
[Outro]
'Cause I
'Cause I
'Cause I, what I've done
