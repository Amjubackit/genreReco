[Verse 1]
When I feel the fear come, I won't run away
'Cause even in valleys, Your presence is enough
When I feel the shaking, I will stand my ground
Your presence is enough
[Chorus]
You are with me, Father, You're for me
Fear will never conquer me, 'cause I belong to Jesus
I'm never alone, I'm never abandoned
Fear you'll never conquer me, 'cause I belong to Jesus
[Verse 2]
When I feel the pressure, I won't run away
'Cause even in tension, Your presence is enough
When I feel the pressing, I will stand my ground
My God, You are enough
[Chorus]
You are with me, Father, You're for me
Fear will never conquer me, 'cause I belong to Jesus
I'm never alone, I'm never abandoned
Fear you'll never conquer me, 'cause I belong to Jesus
'Cause I belong to Jesus
[Bridge]
When the rain fell, when the floods came
When the wind blew, I was okay
'Cause You were right there, You're in every step I take
If the night falls, if my heart aches
If I stumble, I will not break
You'll be with me, You're in every step I take
When the rain fell, when the floods came
When the wind blew, I was okay
You were right there, You're in every step I take
If the night falls, if my heart aches
If I stumble, I will not break
You'll be with me, You're in every step I take
[Chorus]
You are with me, Father, You're for me
Fear will never conquer me, 'cause I belong to Jesus
I'm never alone, I'm never abandoned
Fear you'll never conquer me, 'cause I belong to Jesus
[Bridge]
When the rain fell, when the floods came
When the wind blew, I was okay
You were right there, You're in every step I take
If the night falls, if my heart aches
If I stumble, I will not break
You'll be with me, You're in every step I take
[Chorus]
You are with me, Father, You're for me
Fear will never conquer me, 'cause I belong to Jesus
I'm never alone, I'm never abandoned
Fear you'll never conquer me, 'cause I belong to Jesus
You are with me, Father, You're for me
Fear will never conquer me, 'cause I belong to Jesus
I'm never alone, I'm never abandoned
Fear you'll never conquer me, 'cause I belong to Jesus
