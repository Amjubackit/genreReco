[Verse 1]
Psychic spies from China try to steal your mind's elation
And little girls from Sweden dream of silver-screen quotation
And if you want these kind of dreams, it's Californication
[Verse 2]
It's the edge of the world and all of Western civilization
The sun may rise in the East, at least it settled in a final location
It's understood that Hollywood sells Californication
[Bridge]
Pay your surgeon very well to break the spell of aging
Celebrity skin: is this your chin or is that war you're waging?
[Pre-Chorus]
First born unicorn
Hardcore soft porn
[Chorus]
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
[Verse 3]
Marry me, girl, be my fairy to the world, be my very own constellation
A teenage bride with a baby inside getting high on information
And buy me a star on the boulevard, it's Californication
