[Chorus]
Can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it
[Verse 1 (Part I): Randy Jackson]
If you look around
The whole world is coming together now (Yeah)
[Chorus]
Can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it
[Verse 1 (Part II): Randy Jackson]
Feel it in the air
The wind is taking it everywhere (Yeah)
[Chorus]
Can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it
[Pre-Chorus: Michael Jackson]
All the colors of the world should be
Lovin' each other wholeheartedly
Yes, it's all right
Take my message to your brother and tell him twice
Spread the word and try to teach the man
Who's hating his brother when hate won't do
Cause  we're all the same
Yes the blood inside me is inside you
Now tell me
[Chorus]
Can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it (Now tell me)
Can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it (Yeah yeah)
[Verse 2: Randy Jackson]
Sing out loud
Because we want to make a crowd (Yeah)
Touch a hand and sing
A sound so pure, salvation rings
[Chorus]
Can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it (Yeah yeah)
Can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it
[Pre-Chorus: Michael Jackson]
All the children of the world should be
Loving each other wholeheartedly
Yes, it's all right
Take my message to your brother and tell him twice
Take the news to the marching men
Who are killing their brothers when death won't do
Cause we're all the same
Yes, the blood inside me is inside of you, now tell me
[Chorus]
Can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it
Can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it
[Verse 3: Randy Jackson]
Every breath you take
Is someone's death in another place
Every healthy smile
Is hunger and strife to another child
But the stars do shine
In promising salvation is near this time
Can you feel it now
So brothers and sisters
Show we know how
Now tell me
[Chorus]
Can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it
Can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it
[Pre-Chorus: Michael Jackson]
All the children of the world should be
Loving each other wholeheartedly
Yes, it's all right
Take my message to your brother and tell him twice
Take the news to the marching men
Who are killing their brothers when death won't do
Cause we're all the same
Yes, the blood inside my veins is inside of you, now tell me
[Chorus]
Can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it
Can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it
