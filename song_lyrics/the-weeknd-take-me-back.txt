[Verse 1]
I've been manipulated a hundred times, but
None of them felt so soft and kind, and
Hell is a place for what we tried, but
Never felt so wrong in my mind, and
Never understood why 
Mama cried
, and
Could it be because our secret's hiding?
I always thought someday you'd find us, but
Waiting for you is like slowly dying
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you kept me warm
You held me close until you let me go
Now my blood is cold
I never had the time to let you know
[Chorus]
Take me back, take me back
Takе me back
Take me back, takе me back
Take me back
[Post-Chorus]
All of me, take all of me
All of me, all of me
Take me back, take me back
Take me back[Verse 2]
Where do we go from here?
Hold my heart and set me free
Where do we go from here?
Kiss me with each melody
Someone I used to fear
'Cause I loved your forbidden touch
The thought of you cut so deep
So I'll open up my scars
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause it keeps me warm
Just hold me close, I'll never let you go
'Cause now my blood is cold
I'm waiting for the day you call my phone
[Chorus]
Take me back, take me back
Take me back
Take me back, take me back
Take me back
[Post-Chorus]
All of me, take all of me
All of me, all of me
Take me back, take me back
Take me back
