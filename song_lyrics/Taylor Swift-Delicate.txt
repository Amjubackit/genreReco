[Intro]
This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink
[Verse 1]
Dive bar on the East Side, where you at?
Phone lights up my nightstand in the black
Come here, you can meet me in the back
Dark jeans and your Nikes, look at you
Oh, damn, never seen that color blue
Just think of the fun things we could do
[Pre-Chorus]
('Cause I like you) This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me
(Yeah, I want you) We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink
[Chorus]
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (Delicate)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
