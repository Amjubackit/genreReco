[Intro: Choir & 
Brent Smith
]
Freedom, la la la la
Freedom, follow me
Freedom, la la la la
Freedom, 
cut it
Freedom, la la la la
Freedom, follow me
Freedom, la la la la
Freedom
[Verse 1: Brent Smith]
Let me tell ya, I'm vicious, not pass-aggressive
I got my finger on my pulse, starin' straight into a hole and I'ma get it
And I'm a savage, it's automatic
I got a way of makin' noise, the power to destroy with no static
[Pre-Chorus: Brent Smith]
'Cause victory is all you need
So cultivate and plant the seed
Hold your breath and count to ten, just count to ten
[Chorus: Brent Smith]
I'm gonna make it rain, 
so ring the bell
I know it all too well
Switchblade on the edge of your wrist
Can I get a witness? (Witness!)
'Cause agony brings no reward
For one more hit and one last score
Don't be a casualty
