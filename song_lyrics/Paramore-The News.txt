[Verse 1]
War, a war, a war on the far side
On the other side of the planet
And I've got war, a war, a war right behind my eyes
Right behind them just like a headache
[Pre-Chorus]
So I turn on the news
Turn off the news
[Chorus]
Every second, our collective heart breaks
All together, every single head shakes
Shut your eyes, but it won't go away
Turn on, turn off the news
Every second, our collective heart brеaks
All together, evеry single head shakes
Shut your eyes, but it won't go away
Turn on, turn off the news
[Verse 2]
Far, I'm far, so far from the front line
Quite the opposite, I'm safe inside
But I worry and I give money and I feel useless behind this computer
And that's just barely scratched the surface of my mind
