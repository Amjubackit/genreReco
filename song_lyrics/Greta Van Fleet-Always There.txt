[Verse 1]
You've been waiting for your lover
When you'll discover
She's always there
Walk a while in her summer
She is the drummer
Of your beating heart
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
[Verse 2]
Won't you tell her that you love her?
And you'll hug her
Most every day
Don't you try to push or shove her
Find another
Or she'll walk away
[Refrain 1]
She'll walk away
She'll walk away
[Chorus]
She's a woman in a dream
One that makes you fall in love
Though her face is never seen
She is what this love is of
