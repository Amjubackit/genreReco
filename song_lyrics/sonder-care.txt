[Verse 1]
You've been working
You've been working late
But I'm glad you're home
Made you dinner
Ran bath water babe
We got time alone
Girl it's a you kinda night
And I want you here with me
It's been a long long time
So I called your mama and told her to watch your kids
[Chorus]
You know I care
(Yes, I do)
You know I care
You know I care bout you
You know I care
'Bout everything you do
