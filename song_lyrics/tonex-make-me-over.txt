[Intro]
Does anybody want the Lord to make 'em over? Let's begin to celebrate Jesus up in here
Hallelujah
[Verse 1]
You know my other side
I can no longer hide
Let you down so many times
Sin freshly crucifies
Thought that I had a plan
I had it all figured out
But the more that you tried to be by my side
The more I pushed you out
All over the building, let me hear you say, "Lord, make me over"
[Chorus]
Lord, make me over (Make me over, Lord)
Lord, make me over (Make me over, Lord)
Lord, make me over (Make me over again)
Make me over again (Is that anybody's prayer out there tonight?)
Make me over again (Somebody out there sing it, come on)
Make me over again
Make me over again
[Verse 2]
Time after time I've failed you
Pierced your side when they already nailed you
Jesus, heal my open wounds
I just want to be more like you
Father, I let you down
What's not like you, just take it out
Reconcile me Jesus, I just want to please you
Wash me and make me whole
Everybody sing it, Lord, make me over
[Chorus]
Lord, make me over
Lord, make me over
Lord, make me over
Make me over again
Make me over again (Does anybody want the lord to make them over?)
Make me over again (Anybody tired of messing up time after time after time after time?)
Make me over again (Anybody ready for change, make some noise up in this place, Lord, make me)
Lord, make me over (Lord, make me, oh)
Lord, make me over (Woah)
Lord, make me over (Ayy, yeah, yeah, make me over, Jesus)
Make me over again (Ooh, woah)
Make me over again (Anybody tired of the evil ways)
Make me over again (Does anybody want God to make 'em over?)
Make me over again (Take out everything that's not like Him? Hey, Lord, make me over)
Lord, make me over (Lord, I realize)
Lord, make me over (Lord, there's some things in my life that I know You're not pleased with)
Lord, make me over (Yeah, woah, yeah)
Make me over again
Make me over again (Lord, I'm tired)
Make me over again (Every day at the same time it's the same thing and I'm ready for change, Lord)
Make me over again (If you wanna change, all over the building, lemme hear you say, "Oh", let me say, "Oh")
[Outro]
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh (Let me hear you say, "Oh")
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh (Lift your hands and say, "Oh")
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh (Oh, make me over, Lord)
Make me over again (Woo, make me over, Lord)
Make me over again (All over, come on, make me over, Lord)
Make me over again (Put your hands in the air)
Make me over again
Make me over again
Make me over again
Make me over again
Make me over again
Make me over again
Make me over again
Make me over again
Make me over again
Make me over again
Make me over again
Make me over again
Make me over again
