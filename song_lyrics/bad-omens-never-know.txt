[Verse 1]
Show me you're better off without me
Choking on every word you said, we'll see, we'll see
Don't breathe another word about me
I'll leave and you can finally rest in peace, we'll see
[Pre-Chorus]
When I go out into the world
I just don't like what I see
You could call it paradise
But it looks just like Hell to me
[Chorus]
Lying in between the memories choking me and
I don't know which way to go, but I'm okay to never know
Lying in between the memories choking me and
I don't know which way to go, but I'm okay to never know
[Verse 2]
Speaking in languages we can't read
No need for you to spell it out for me, for me
Swallowed up and I spit you out
Like a drug that just wouldn't stay down, stay down
[Pre-Chorus]
When I go out into the world
I just don't like what I see
You could call it paradise
But it looks just like Hell to me[Chorus]
Lying in between the memories choking me and
I don't know which way to go, but I'm okay to never know
Lying in between the memories choking me and
I don't know which way to go, but I'm okay to never know
[Post-Chorus]
We'll see, we'll see
[Bridge]
Lying in between the memories choking me and
I don't know which way to go and I'm okay to never know
[Chorus]
Lying in between the memories choking me and
I don't know which way to go, but I'm okay to never know
Lying in between the memories choking me and
I don't know which way to go, but I'm okay to never know
[Outro]
We'll see, we'll see, we'll see
But I'm okay to never know
