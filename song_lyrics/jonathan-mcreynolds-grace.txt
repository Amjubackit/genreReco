I needed Your grace more than I thought I ever would
You forgave more than I thought You ever could
I was stronger in my head but truth is
I need Your grace
I needed Your grace more than I thought I ever would
You forgave more than I thought You ever could
I was stronger in my head but truth is
I need Your grace
[Chorus]
(Grace)
I need Your grace (Grace)
I need Your grace (Grace)
I need Your grace
'Couldn't make it without Your grace (Grace)
Be'd lost without Your grace (Grace)
Oh, I need Your grace
Oh, thank God for grace (Grace)
I really need Your grace, ooh-ooh (Grace)
I need Your grace
Gra-a-a-a-ace (Grace, grace, grace)
I need Your gra-a-a-ace
[Outro]
I needed Your grace
More than I thought I ever would
