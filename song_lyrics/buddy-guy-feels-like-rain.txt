[Verse 1: Buddy Guy]
Down here the river, meets the sea
And in the sticky heat, I feel ya' open up to me
Love comes out of nowhere baby, just like a hurricane
[Chorus: Buddy Guy and Bonnie Raitt]
And it feels like rain
And it feels like rain
[Verse 2: Buddy Guy]
Lying here, underneath the stars, right next to you
And I'm wondering who you are and, how do you do?
How do you do, baby?
Clouds roll in across the moon and the wind hollers out your name
[Chorus: Buddy Guy and Bonnie Raitt]
And it feels like rain
And it feels like rain
{Guitar Solo: Buddy Guy}
[Verse 3: Buddy Guy]
We never going to make that bridge tonight, baby
Across lake Ponchartrain
[Chorus: Buddy Guy and Bonnie Raitt]
And it feels like rain
And it feels like rain[Verse 4: Buddy Guy]
So batten down the hatch baby and leave your heart up your sleeve
It looks like we're in for stormy weather, that ain't no cause for us to leave
Just lay here, in my arms, let it wash away the pain
[Chorus: Buddy Guy and Bonnie Raitt]
And it feels like rain
And it feels like rain
