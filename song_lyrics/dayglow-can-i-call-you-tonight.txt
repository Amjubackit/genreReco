[Verse 1]
I feel close
Well, maybe I'm not, heaven knows
It's a spotlight stuck on the ceiling
Why are these the things that I'm feeling?
There's so much time
For me to speak up, but I keep quiet
I'll complicate the most of the mantra
The power's out and I can't turn the fan on
[Chorus]
So can I call you tonight?
I'm trying to make up my mind
Just how I feel
Could you tell me what's real?
I hear your voice on the phone
Now I'm no longer alone
Just how I feel
Could you tell me what's real anymore?
'Cause I wouldn't know
[Verse 2]
Voice so low
Sneaking around, so it goes
I always try my best to listen
Picking up things that I can fidget
Circle speed
Pacing around, watching my feet
Batteries drain, I get the memo
"I think that I might have to let you go"
