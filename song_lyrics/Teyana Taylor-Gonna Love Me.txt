[Intro: Randy Cain]
And oh, you're gonna love me
You're gonna wanna hug me and squeeze me
[Verse 1: Teyana Taylor]
Sometimes we say things that we really don't mean
We do things in between the lines
We should do more to stand out
I'm sorry if I made you feel less than who you are
A little insecure, oh, you's a shining star
[Chorus: Teyana Taylor]
I wanna spend my nights with you
My life with you, oh baby, babe
Please wait up for me 'til whenever I get home
I know that you're all alone
Thinking 'bout what you're gon' do
I hope that you see it through, ooh, ooh
[Post-Chorus: Randy Cain]
And oh, you're gonna love me
You're gonna wanna hug me and squeeze me
[Verse 2: Teyana Taylor]
Sometimes I don't think we really say enough
Why is it so hard to keep in touch
When we're laying right next to each other, baby
We shouldn't read into things so much
Overthinking understanding
Don't let a feeling change it up
