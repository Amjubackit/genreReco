[Verse 1]
Last night might as well have been an all-out war
Girl, I don't wanna fight like that no more
Let's clean the slate instead of drag this out
I'm sorry, babe, let's just start over now
[Verse 2]
I don't give a damn who's wrong or right
Nothin' hurts me more than to see you cry
Let's put it all in the past, it ain't worth fightin' about
Instead of lookin' back, let's just start over now
[Chorus]
It is what it is and it ain't what it was
And this ain't me sayin' let's get back to us
This is lovin' you enough to tell you goodbye
'Cause it's all we got left that we ain't yet tried
So let's start over now
Yeah, let's start over now
[Verse 3]
Still ain't changed my mind on meant-to-be
If time alone is what it takеs to bring you back to me
Give me onе more kiss before the sun goes down
Let's get it over with, let's just start over now
