[Verse 1]
There is a table
Filled with best food
Can you hear The Father calling?
There's a seat just for you
And at this table, all is forgiven
Trade in your chains of bondage
For crowns of freedom
[Chorus]
All are welcome at the table
There is a place just for you
No condemnation at the table
There is a place just for you
[Verse 2]
This is the table of new beginnings
These cups are full of love
And it's never-ending (Oh, no, no)
And at this table therе are no orphans
Just a loving father
And his sons & daughters
[Chorus]
All arе welcome at the table
There is a place just for you
No condemnation at the table
There is a place just for you
Just for you
(Oh-ooh)
[Bridge]
Leave your shame at the door
You won't need it anymore (You won't need it anymore)
Hold your head up high
This is the start of your new life
Leave your chains at the door
They can't hold you anymore
Hold your head up high (Lift your head)
This is the start of your new life
[Chorus]
All are welcome at the table
There is a place just for you
No condemnation at the table
There is a place just for you
There is a place just for you
