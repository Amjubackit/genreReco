[Verse 1]
There is a table
Filled with best food
Can you hear The Father calling?
There's a seat just for you
And at this table, all is forgiven
Trade in your chains of bondage
For crowns of freedom
[Chorus]
All are welcome at the table
There is a place just for you
No condemnation at the table
There is a place just for you
[Verse 2]
This is the table of new beginnings
These cups are full of love
And it's never-ending (Oh, no, no)
And at this table therе are no orphans
Just a loving father
And his sons & daughters
[Chorus]
All arе welcome at the table
There is a place just for you
No condemnation at the table
There is a place just for you
Just for you
(Oh-ooh)
