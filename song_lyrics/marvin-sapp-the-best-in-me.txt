He saw the best in me
When everyone else around
Could only see the worst in me
Can I tell y'all one more time? One more time?
I said he saw the best in me
When everyone else around me
Could only see the worst in me
I wish I had a witness tonight, all I need is one
He saw the best in me
When everyone else around me
Could only see the worst in me
Does anybody have their testimony?
When folks wrote you off
Said you would never make it
What did he see?
He saw the best in me
When everyone else around me
When everyone else around could only see the worst in me
Can I tell you all one more thing?
I just need to tell you one more thing, listen to this
See, he's mine, and I am his
It doesn't matter what I did
He only sees me for who I am
Does anyone know that tonight?
