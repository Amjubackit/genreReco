[Intro]
Can only imagine
Can you imagine, just standing before the king? oh
[Verse 1]
I can only imagine
What it would be like
When I walk, by your side
I can only imagine, yeah
What my eyes would see
When your face, is before me
I can only imagine
I can only imagine
[Chorus]
To be surrounded by your glory
What will my heart feel
Will I dance for you Jesus
Or in awe of you be still
Will I stand in your presence
To my knees will I fall
Will I sing hallelujah
Will I be able to speak at all
I can only imagine, yeah
I can only imagine
[Verse 2]
I can only imagine, when that day comes
And I find myself standing in the sun
I can only imagine, when all I will do
Is forever, forever worship you
I can only imagine, hum
I can only imagine
[Chorus]
To be surrounded by your glory
What will my heart feel
Will I dance for you Jesus
Or in awe of you be still
Will I stand in your presence
To my knees will I fall
Will I sing hallelujah
Will I be able to speak at all
I can only imagine, yeah
I can only imagine
[Chorus 2]
To be surrounded by your glory
What will my heart feel
Will I dance for you Jesus?
Or in awe of you be still
Will I stand in your presence?
To my knees will I fall
Will I sing hallelujah
Will I be able to speak at all
Can you only imagine?
Can you only imagine?
[Bridge]
If you don't have any words to say, will you cry out
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
This is our war cry, just to behold your face
Thank you for your amazing grace, oh
Everyday will be Sunday, Sabbath will have no end oh
Just to be in your presence Jesus
To hear you say well done, well done
[Outro]
Oh, to bow at your feet
I can only imagine
I can only imagine
I can only imagine
