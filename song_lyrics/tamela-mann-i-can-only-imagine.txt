[Intro]
Can only imagine
Can you imagine, just standing before the king? oh
[Verse 1]
I can only imagine
What it would be like
When I walk, by your side
I can only imagine, yeah
What my eyes would see
When your face, is before me
I can only imagine
I can only imagine
[Chorus]
To be surrounded by your glory
What will my heart feel
Will I dance for you Jesus
Or in awe of you be still
Will I stand in your presence
To my knees will I fall
Will I sing hallelujah
Will I be able to speak at all
I can only imagine, yeah
I can only imagine
