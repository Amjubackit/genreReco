[Verse 1]
Well I don't mind sleeping alone
If it means I don't have to play your crazy games no more
You're the most precious thing I've ever seen
But I ain't gonna let it slide when you're mean to me
I know the love that I deserve
[Chorus]
And I hope you find yourself
Before I find somebody else to be my lover
And I hope you find yourself
Before I find somebody else to be my lover
[Verse 2]
Well, you tell me things I wanna hear
You want me near, and I know you feel me leaving you
You think that I won't say goodbye
But baby I ain't standing by while you stretch the truth
I know the love that I deserve
[Chorus]
And I hope you find yourself
Before I find somebody else to be my lover
I said I hope you find yourself
Before I find somebody else to be my lover
I know the love that I deserve
[Bridge]
I know the love that I deserve
Oh, I know the love that I deserve
I know the love that I deserve
[Chorus]
I said I hope you find yourself
Before I find somebody else to be my lover
I hope you find yourself
Before I find somebody else to be my lover
[Outro]
Oh I said I hope you find, I hope you find
I said I hope you find, I hope you find
I hope you find yourself before I found somebody else
