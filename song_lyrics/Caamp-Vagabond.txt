[Verse 1]
In the night while my body slept in my bed
My mind was running through the woods instead
One hundred miles an hour in the fast lane
One hundred miles an hour in my head
[Verse 2]
Vagabond dreamin' takes me through the night
Sippin' whiskey by the river living out of sight
One hundred miles an hour in the fast lane
One hundred miles an hour toward the light
[Verse 3]
See the curve in that river's bend
I look at you and I see my friend
One hundred miles an hour in the fast lane
One hundred miles an hour till the end
[Verse 4]
My heart does beat like a Cherokee drum
And in the morning when that sun does come
One hundred miles an hour in the fast lane
One hundred miles an hour in the fast lane
One hundred miles an hour 'till I'm dead
