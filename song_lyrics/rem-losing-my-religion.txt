[Instrumental Intro]
[Verse 1]
Oh, life is bigger
It's bigger than you, and you are not me
The lengths that I will go to
The distance in your eyes
Oh no, I've said too much
I set it up
[Pre-Chorus]
That's me in the corner
That's me in the spotlight
Losin' my religion
Tryin' to keep up with you
And I don't know if I can do it
Oh no, I've said too much
I haven't said enough
[Chorus]
I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try
[Verse 2]
Every whisper of every waking hour
I'm choosin' my confessions
Tryin' to keep an eye on you
Like a hurt, lost, and blinded fool, fool
Oh no, I've said too much
I set it up[Pre-Chorus]
Consider this
Consider this the hint of the century
Consider this the slip
That brought me to my knees, failed
What if all these fantasies come flailing around?
And now, I've said too much
[Chorus]
I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try
[Bridge]
But that was just a dream
That was just a dream
[Pre-Chorus]
That's me in the corner
That's me in the spotlight
Losin' my religion
Tryin' to keep up with you
And I don't know if I can do it
Oh no, I've said too much
I haven't said enough[Chorus]
I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try
[Outro]
But that was just a dream
Try, cry, why try?
That was just a dream
Just a dream, just a dream, dream
