[Intro]
Un, deux, trois, hmm!
[Verse 1]
Move your hips along with the music
Lick your lips but don’t over-do it
Bend your knees along with the summer
Keep your beat but don’t kill the drummer
[Pre-Chorus 1]
It’s true
I wanna be with you tonight
But I’m a little too late
[Verse 2]
Just be calm and move with the season
Winter’s gone and so has your reason
Daisies bloom and so will desire
Keep your cool and blow out the fire
[Pre-Chorus 2]
It's true
I wanna be with you tonight
But I’m a little too late, I’m a little too late
I'm a little too late, too late, too late!
