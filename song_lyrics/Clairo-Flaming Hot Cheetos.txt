[Intro]
Tu-tu-ru-tu-tu
Tu-ru-tu-tu-tu
Tu-tu-ru-tu-tu
Tu-ru-tu-tu-tu
Tu-tu-ru-tu-tu
Tu-ru-tu-tu-tu
[Verse 1]
Sometimes I feel like I just wanna go back to my old ways
You're telling me I'm silly
It's no fun in the old days
I'm such a romantic
I never remember how things really happen
I guess you're attractive
Or something
[Verse 2]
Live in the moment
That's what they tell me
But what ever happened
To when you would hold me
And hold me
And hold me
[Pre-Chorus]
Girlfriend or girl that's a friend?
It's easy just to pretend
That we don't have something real
