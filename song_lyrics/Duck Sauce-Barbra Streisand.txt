[Intro: Barbra Streisand]
New York is the place of opportunities. If there's any place in this world that you want to come to, to be able to make it big, or to go after your dreams, it's New York City
Wooo, wooo, wooo-ooh
[Chorus]
Barbra Streisand
Wooo, wooo, wooo-ooh, wooo, wooo, wooo-ooh
Wooo, wooo, wooo-ooh, wooo, wooo, wooo
Barbra Streisand
Wooo, wooo, wooo-ooh, wooo, wooo, wooo-ooh
Wooo, wooo, wooo-ooh, wooo, wooo, wooo
Barbra Streisand
Wooo, wooo, wooo-ooh, wooo, wooo, wooo-ooh
Wooo, wooo, wooo-ooh, wooo, wooo, wooo-ooh
Wooo, wooo, wooo-ooh, wooo, wooo, wooo-ooh
Wooo, wooo, wooo-ooh, wooo, wooo, wooo
