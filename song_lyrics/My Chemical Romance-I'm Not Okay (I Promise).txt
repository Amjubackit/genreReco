[Instrumental Intro]
[Verse 1]
Well, if you wanted honesty
That's all you had to say
I never want to let you down
Or have you go, it's better off this way
[Pre-Chorus]
For all the dirty looks
The photographs your boyfriend took
Remember when you broke your foot
From jumping out the second floor?
[Chorus]
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
You wear me out
[Verse 2]
What will it take to show you
That it's not the life it seems?
 
(
I'm not okay
)
I've told you time and time again
You sing the words, but don't know what it means
 
(
I'm not okay
)
