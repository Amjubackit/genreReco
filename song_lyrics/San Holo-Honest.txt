[Verse 1]
How can I try to keep it hidden
When I'm feeling like you're reading my mind?
High and I don't know what I'm thinking
But I'm talking to you like I can't lie
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I don't know you
You don't know me
But I wanna go anywhere you're gonna be, oh
I just want us to be honest
Even if nothing comes from it, no
Come with me
Something so true in the ways that we speak, oh
I just want us to be honest
I just want us to be honest
[Chorus]
I just want us to be honest
I just want us to be honest
I just want us to be honest
I just want us to be honest
[Verse 2]
I love how I hear it in your silence
There's no need for you to say it out loud
Closer now, nothing in between us
Let's keep everything between us, no doubt
And I am never this person, never this certain
But you got me willing to try
Willing to try
I wanna try
