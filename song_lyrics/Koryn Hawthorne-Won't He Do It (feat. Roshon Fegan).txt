[Verse 1]
Ain't nobody stoppin' my shine
They try to break me try to take me out
But I got Jesus on my side
Felt so bad I thought I would die
But ain't no power stronger than the one
That came and laid down his life
And I got mountains to climb
But the enemy can't stop me
'Cause there's a calling on my life
So, when I'm crying, don't last too long
'Cause he's gon' step in and make it alright
[Chorus]
Won't He do it?
He said He would
Fight your battles for you
They gon' wonder how you sleep at night
Won't He do it?
Ah yes, He will
Anybody tell you something different
You know that's a lie
You gon' look back and be so amazed
How it turned out
It's only His grace
Won't He do it?
He said He would
So, I trust Him at all times
