I caught every single red light as I cried my way back home
My good lord she turned me sideways in the end
But I will never let nobody do me twice what she done wrong
Fool me once, shame on you, I'll be gone
Fool me once and I'll be gone
I'm gonna leave my house and home
I'm gonna go out on the road and sing my songs
I might find a love sometime
I might even walk the line
But fool me once, shame on you, I'll be gone
You can trick me into thinking that you love me for awhile
You can make me think your love was really real
But I will read between the lines
Before you shine your plastic smile
And when I do, I will run for miles and miles
Fool me once and I'll be gone
I'm gonna leave my house and home
I'm gonna go out on the road and sing my songs
I might find a love sometime
I might even walk the line
But fool me once, shame on you, I'll be gone
Fool me once and I'll be gone
I'm gonna leave my house and home
I'm gonna go out on the road and sing my songs
I might find a love sometime
I might even walk the line
But fool me once, shame on you, I'll be gone
Fool me once, shame on you, I'll be gone
