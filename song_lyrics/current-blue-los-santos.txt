[Chorus]
Los Santos shit got me caught up in a mood
Address one text, come and party on the roof
New whip, no keys, but you still coming through
Top floor, top down, I can show you how to move
Los Santos shit got me caught up in a mood
Address one text, come and party on the roof
New whip, no keys, but you still coming through
Top floor, top down, I can show you how to move
[Verse]
East coast, west side, flying out to my place
Sleeping 'til a quarter past three, still sideways
Driving downtown in a white tee
Gym shorts with the Nikes
One sec, running back to the old you
Jetlag in the back of an '02
New days in the Ville hope you roll through
One call, one text and I told you
[Chorus]
Los Santos shit got me caught up in a mood
Address one text, come and party on the roof
New whip, no keys, but you still coming through
Top floor, top down, I can show you how to move
Los Santos shit got me caught up in a mood
Address one text, come and party on the roof
New whip, no keys, but you still coming through
Top floor, top down, I can show you how to move[Chorus]
Los Santos shit got me caught up in a mood
Address one text, come and party on the roof
New whip, no keys, but you still coming through
Top floor, top down, I can show you how to move
Los Santos shit got me caught up in a mood
Address one text, come and party on the roof
New whip, no keys, but you still coming through
Top floor, top down, I can show you how to move
