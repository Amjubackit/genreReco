[Intro]
Pain, without love
Pain, I can't get enough
Pain, I like it rough
'Cause I'd rather feel pain than nothing at all
[Verse 1]
You're sick of feeling numb
You're not the only one
I'll take you by the hand
And I'll show you a world that you can understand
This life is filled with hurt
When happiness doesn't work
Trust me, and take my hand
When the lights go out you'll understand
[Chorus]
Pain (Pain), without love
Pain (Pain), I can't get enough
Pain (Pain), I like it rough
'Cause I'd rather feel pain than nothing at all
Pain (Pain), without love
Pain (Pain), I can't get enough
Pain (Pain), I like it rough
'Cause I'd rather feel pain than nothing at all
