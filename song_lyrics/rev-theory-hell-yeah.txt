[Intro]
You feel that? You better hold on
This one's about to get bumpy
Hahahahahahahaha...
[Verse 1]
She's a ten, hell bent
I'm in heaven tonight
Six speed, sex scene
Playing out in my mind
One look, I'm hooked
Motor runnin'
Left off
My heart started pumpin'
[Pre-Chorus]
Are you ready for the best damn ride of your life?
[Chorus 1]
Give me a "Hell"
Give me a "Yeah"
Stand up right now
And give me a "Hell"
Give me a "Yeah"
Stand up right now
[Post-Chorus]
Get ready to go
She ain't moving slow
She's taking control
Pushing the pedal through the floor
I'm begging for more
You better hold on tight
[Bridge 1]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
[Verse 2]
Got a taste, can't be saved
I'm a junkie for life
She fuels my fire
And adrenaline high
My need for speed's got me gunning
One touch, she screams "Keep it coming"
[Pre-Chorus]
Are you ready for the best damn ride of your life?
[Chorus 1]
Give me a "Hell"
Give me a "Yeah"
Stand up right now
And give me a "Hell"
Give me a "Yeah"
Stand up right now
[Post-Chorus]
Get ready to go
She ain't moving slow
She's taking control
Pushing the pedal through the floor
I'm begging for more
You better hold on tight
[Bridge 2]
Hahahahahahahaha...
Almost home (Almost home, ...)
(Hey, hey, hey, hey)
(Hey, hey, hey, hey) Come on
(Hey, hey, hey, hey) Yeah
[Chorus 2]
Give me a "Hell"
Give me a "Yeah" (Hell Yeah)
Stand up right now
And give me a "Hell"
Give me a "Yeah"
Stand up right now (Right Now)
Give me a "Hell"
Give me a "Yeah" (Yeah!)
Stand up right now
And give me a "Hell"
Give me a "Yeah"
Stand up right now (Right Now)
[Post-Chorus]
Get ready to go
She ain't moving slow
She's taking control
Pushing the pedal through the floor
I'm begging for more
You better hold on tight
[Outro]
Give me a "Hell"
Give me a "Yeah"
Give me a "Hell"
Give me a "Yeah", hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
