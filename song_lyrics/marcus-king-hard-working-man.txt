[Verse 1]
Up late, all night
I don't even need a reason why
Your love is so right
I can't wait until the morning light
To get back, when I'm through
And bring my living on home to you
[Chorus]
Hey, honey don't you understand?
I been working all day, doin' the best I can
Got that easy lovin' if you'd take my hand
I'm a hard-working man
I'm a hard-working man, yes, I am
[Verse 2]
Just wait, payday
I'm gonna take you somewhere far away
Us two, sky blue
But first, I got to make a run or two
Bossman, he's on the line
Said he's gonna give me overtime
[Chorus]
Hey, honey don't you understand?
I been working all day, doin' the best I can
Got that easy lovin' if you'd take my hand
I'm a hard-working man
I'm a hard-working man, bet your life I am
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Hey, honey don't you undеrstand?
I been working all day, doin' the best I can
Got that easy lovin' if you'd takе my hand
I'm a hard-working man
I'm a hard-working man, yes, I am
Hey, honey don't you understand?
I been working all day, doin' the best I can
Got that easy lovin' if you'd take my hand
I'm a hard-working man
I'm a hard-working man, yes, I am
[Outro]
Hard-working man, baby
Hard-working man
Ohh. bet your life I am, baby
Well, I'm a hard-working, darlin'
