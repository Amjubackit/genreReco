[Intro]
They're just words, words, words, words that you say
"I love you" is so easy, they're playing those games
I need action, I've got no time to waste
They're just words, words, words, words that you say
[Verse]
All I need, all I need, all is need is one touch
Wanna feel, wanna feel, wanna feel like I'm loved again
No I don't think I'm asking too much
I need more than words
[Pre-Chorus]
You don't know, what I'm going through lately
You don't know, the way that you make me lose control
Going out my mind
Time after time after time
[Chorus]
They're just words, words, words, words that you say
"I love you" is so easy, they're playing those games
I need action, I've got no time to waste
They're just words, words, words, words that you say
[Verse]
All I need, all I need, all is need is one touch
Wanna feel, wanna feel, wanna feel like I'm lovеd again
No I don't think I'm asking too much
I need more than words[Pre-Chorus]
You don't know, what I'm going through lately
You don't know, the way that you makе me lose control
Going out my mind
Time after time after time
[Chorus]
They're just words, words, words, words that you say
"I love you" is so easy, they're playing those games
I need action, I've got no time to waste
They're just words, words, words, words that you say
[Outro Build-up]
Words that you say
Words that you say
Words, words, words, words that you say
Words that you say
Words that you say
They're just words, words, words, words that you say
