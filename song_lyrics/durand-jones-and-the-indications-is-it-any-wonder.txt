[Verse 1]
This road is gon’ take us back now
You look so fine, I don’t know how to act now
They say “My child, don’t stroll off easy
‘Cause when it’s time, you gon’ hear what she said”
[Chorus]
Is it any wonder?
Is it any wonder?
[Verse 2]
If you ever, leave me alone
I’ll be cryin’, wishin’ you’d come home
When I look in your eyes, I see you starin’ at me, girl
And when it’s time, I see you holdin’ on me, girl
‘Cause you, you got a hold on me, yeah
So I’m, gonna make you see, yeah
Aw yeah
[Chorus]
Is it any wonder?
Is it any wonder?
Is it any wonder?
Is it any wonder?
[Bridge]
When the sun goes down at night
Gon’ let you know that everything’s alright[Chorus]
Is it any wonder?
Is it any wonder?
Is it any wonder?
Is it any wonder?
Is it any wonder?
Is it any wonder?
Is it any wonder?
Is it any wonder?
Is it any wonder?
Aw, baby
