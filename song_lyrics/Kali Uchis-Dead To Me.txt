[Intro]
(You're dead to me)
(You're dead to me)
Woo, ooh, ooh (Ooh)
Woo, ooh, ooh (Ooh)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (Ooh)
Woo, ooh, ooh
[Verse 1]
I don't know what you been told
See, I am not your enemy (Uh, oh-oh)
But if there's one thing that I know
Is that you ain't a friend to me (Uh, oh-oh)
So don't come for me unless I send for you
Know you're dead to me (Uh, oh-oh)
Just don't come for me, I won't send for you
Know you're dead to me
You're dead to me, oh
[Chorus]
You're dead to me (You're dead to me)
You're obsessed, just let me go
You're dead to me (You're dead to me)
I'm not somebody you know
You're dead to me (You're dead to me)
Could you just leave me alone?
You're dead to me
