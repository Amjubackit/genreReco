[Chorus: Twin Shadow and D'Angelo Lacy]
I get to thinking that I, that I should call you
I like to think about the first time that I saw you
Thinking about you as if i lost you (you, you, you, you)
I get to thinking that I, that I should call you
I like to think about the first time that I saw you
Thinking about you as if i lost you (you, you)
[Verse1: Twin Shadow]
It's the sickest kinda feeling I got, won't leave me alone
When you can get your hands out and you want every little chance that I got
I'll give it away for free
It's the sickest kinda feeling I got, won't leave me alone
When you can get your hands out and you want every little chance that I got
I'll give it away for free
[Bridge:D'Angelo Lacy]
We love to love
We love to touch
This world to me is never gonna be enough
We love to love
We love to touch
This world to me is never gonna be enough
love, love
love, love
Thinking about you as if i lost you
[Bridge:D'Angelo Lacy]
We love to love
We love to touch
This world to me is never gonna be enough
We love to love
We love to touch
This world to me is never gonna be enough
love, love
love, love
love, love
love, love
