[Verse 1]
We both drip in this sweat
She bite in on my lip
I put my hands on her neck
She feelin' all on my, my
She feelin' all on my chest
Takin' my breath away
This bitch done got me obsessed
Her touch like ecstasy
[Build]
Grip on her waist line
Ain't tryna waste time
Drop that ass low like a bass line
Popped a pill, I can't feel my face
I'm solar system, I'm outer space
I'm potion sipping, can't keep my pace
This molly water don't need no chase
I'm floatin', floatin', floatin'
[Drop]
Chase I'm floatin'
Chase I'm floatin'
[Post-Drop]
Grip on her waist line
Ain't tryna waste time
Drop that ass low like a bass line
Grip on her waist line
Ain't tryna waste timе
Drop that ass low like a bass line
Grip on her waist linе
Ain't tryna waste time
Drop that ass low like a bass line
Bass line, bass line, bass line, bass line
[Verse 2]
Eyes roll back in my head
No time for sleepin', I'm geekin'
I might just dance 'til I'm dead
Oh what a happy ending
Chemicals in my body
Chemicals in my body
I'm in love with pink molly
I'm in love with-with-with
[Build]
Grip on her waist line
Ain't tryna waste time
Drop that ass low like a bass line
Popped a pill, I can't feel my face
I'm solar system, I'm outer space
I'm potion sipping, can't keep my pace
This molly water don't need no chase
I'm floatin', floatin', floatin'
[Drop]
Chase I'm floatin'
Chase I'm floatin'
Floatin'
Floatin'
Floatin'
