[Intro: Masego & 
Don Toliver
]
We've got it together, we vibin', you need to go
You're not even there, I wanna die, baby
We've got it together, we vibin', you need to go
You're not even there, I wanna die, baby
We've got it together, we vibin', you need to go (
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
)
You're not even there, I wanna die, baby (
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
)
We've got it together, we vibin', you need to go (
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
)
You're not even therе, I wanna die, baby (
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
)
[Chorus: Masego]
Thinkin' I could make this many songs 'bout a lady
When I havеn't met her, but she on me heavy, on my cerebellum
If I say I love her, am I wrong? Am I crazy?
Am I overzealous? But I know the feeling, and I'm never wrong
Swear that I've been gifted with a song and a medley
It's intoxicating, it weigh on you heavy like the alcohol
We can do, like, anything you want, I'm amazing
Letter to my lady, I just wanna please you, check my catalog
[Verse 1: Masego]
In this life, I've come across fans and hoes
And I like to give my fans a rose
Curse of the talented
Everywhere I go, they wanna change clothes and pose
But my wife be in my dreams, bruh; no, I couldn't see her
I saw her silhouette, I know I can make her wet
But when I wake up alone, 'lone, 'lone
I just break out my phone, phone, phone
