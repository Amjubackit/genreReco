[Verse 1: Dacus, Dacus & Baker]
You said you wanted to feel alive
So we went to the beach
You were born in July '95
In a deadly heat
You say you're a winter bitch
But summer's in your blood
You can't help but become the sun
[Verse 2: Dacus, Dacus & Baker, All]
When you moved to Chicago
You were spinnin' out
When you don't know who you are
You fuck around and find out
When you called me from the train
Water freezin' in your eyes
You were happy and I wasn't surprised
[Chorus: All]
And it feels good to be known so well
I can't hide from you like I hide from myself
[Verse 3: Dacus, All]
Now you're movin' in
Breakin' a sweat on your upper lip
And gettin' pissed about humidity
And the leaky faucet
You already hurt my feelings three times
In the way only you could
[Chorus: All]
But it feels good to be known so well
I can't hide from you like I hide from myself
I remember who I am when I'm with you
Your love is tough, your love is tried and true-blue
Blue
[Bridge: Dacus & Bridgers, All, Dacus]
You've never done me wrong, except for that one time
That we don't talk about
Because it doesn't matter anymore
Who won the fight? I don't know
We're not keeping score
[Chorus: All]
And it feels good to be known so well
I can't hide from you like I hide from myself
I remember who I am when I'm with you
Your love is tough, your love is tried and true-blue
[Outro: All]
Blue
Blue
Blue
