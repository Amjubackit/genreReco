[Intro](Spoken)
One-double-oh-seven (100.7)
This is for you fellas (no, no joke)
Ha ha ha
Something I cooked up the Dope House
In my kitchen ha ha ha yeah
[Verse One]
Roll Cadillacs never lie on raps
Smoke killer herb till my lungs collapse
Lost two grand last night shooting craps
The I hit the Ritz and bought a few laps
Just got a letter from my old best friend
Doing twenty-five in the federal pen
Wanna come home but he said until then
Could I look over his three children
They wake em up at five am for Fruit Loops
Draped in white overalls and black boots
Used to drive a Lac sipping gin and juice
Now we need money for some chips and soups
Run around town with a sack of rocks
Polo shirt with the matching socks
Mom I promise one day I'mma stop
I'mma grow up and be a astro-naut
[Hook]
