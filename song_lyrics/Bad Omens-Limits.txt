[Verse 1]
You set me up as the villain
But you never mentioned the root of the problem
Took what you wanted and flipped it
But you won't be dragging my name to the bottom
[Pre-Chorus]
So much unsaid, left me for dead, I won't forget
And now you're next
Well, everyone's listenin'
And they know the difference
You're not failing our senses
[Chorus]
If you're throwin' me to the lions
You should know I'm not scared of dyin'
I wouldn't take back
One thing I did, one word I said
But I'm gonna make you wish you did
[Verse 2]
Jump to conclusions, they fall for illusions
But you wouldn't dare try to stop 'em
You're going low at the end of the road
But that won't be the path that I follow
