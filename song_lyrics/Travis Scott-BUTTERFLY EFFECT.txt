[Intro]
(
All the commas
)
(
Murda on the beat, so it's not nice
)
Ooh, hmm
[Chorus]
For this life, I cannot change (Change)
Hidden Hills, deep off in the main (Main)
M&M's, sweet like candy cane (M&M's, candy cane)
Drop the top, pop it, let it bang (Top, pop it, pop it)
For this life, I cannot change (Change)
In the hills, deep off in the main (Hills, the main)
M&M's, sweet like candy cane (M&M's, candy cane)
Drop the top, pop it, let it bang (Top, pop it, pop it)
[Verse 1]
Drop the top, play hide and seek (Yeah)
Jump inside, jump straight to the league (League)
Take a sip, feel just how I be (It's lit)
On Freeway, but no, ain't nothin' free (Straight up)
Bend laws, bend lanes (Skrrt, skrrt)
Been bustin' bills, but still, ain't nothin' change (Skrrt, skrrt)
You in the mob soon as you rock the chain (Mob)
She caught the waves, just thumbin' through my braids (Alright)
Heatin' up, baby, I'm just heatin' up (It's lit)
Need your love, not a need, it is a must (Yeah)
Feelin' stuck, you know how to keep me up (Yeah, yeah)
Icy love, icy like a hockey puck (Alright)
