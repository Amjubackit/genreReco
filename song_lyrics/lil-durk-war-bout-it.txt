[Intro: Lil Durk]
Yeah
Let me pop my shit, nigga
Uh, let me pop my shit
Let me pop my shit (Go)
[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
I just sent that boy two thousand, he ain't never post my album (Go)
He ain't never shot his gun for me for free, I'm bein' a thousand (Go)
You did what you did, I left you 'round my kids, I gave you power (Go)
I told bro, "Go hit your main opps," knowin' damn well they ain't ours (Man, what?)
I just swapped some Glocks from two, three of them blocks, ain't let a round off (Give me that)
And them niggas heard they mans scream, they gotta turn the sound off (Give me that)
Fuck what it seem, I'm goin' off what I seen, bitch, get a pound off (Pussy)
One opp nineteen, he bringin' my brother to school, they knocked his gown off
I callеd Mak OG, I got lil' bro a lawyer, hundred thousand (Thou')
Look at Fyndee Boyy, he touch on littlе boys, he pedophilin' (Nasty)
Up my gun on one of the opp' blogs, them boys gon' televise it (Yeah)
I can't name the shit I'm behind, but I can make my mama prouder (On Pluto grave)
I seen lil' bro one nigga outside his socks, he brag about it (Nigga brag about it)
Why you bring your cousin around? You know he a rat, let's talk about it (Cheese, haha)
See, the biggest hoes, they be the biggest hoes, let's talk about it (Let's talk)
And the city know I know too many moes, Cokilla valid (On Stone)
[Chorus: Lil Durk & 21 Savage]
If you ever been involved, you can't talk about it (Shh)
I seen a killer do an interview, he tellin', tellin' (You fucked me up)
Why you ain't never clear that rumor up? You know I'm valid (You fucked me up)
See, I ain't respond on Instagram, I know how to go about it (I know how to go about it)
Since he died, just come outside and go to war about him (Bitch-ass)
He say, "No," I'm thinkin' he let a ho got him (Go, go, no)
He say, "No," I say, "Let's go to war about it" (Go, go, no)
Where he go? You better know the morgue got him (Yeah, man, what?)
[Verse 2: 21 Savage]
Knock 'em all down like dominos
Don't talk on the 'Gram 'cause we put shit in vanish mode
Last one was easy, he pull up on random hoes
Think you tough? My lil' niggas got the antidote
Free my nigga Zoo, I'm OTF 4L (21)
If you catch a murder, nigga, keep it to yourself (On God)
He think he a boxer, now he fightin' for his breath (Huh)
I don't care who done seen me, ask my lawyer, I wasn't there (21)
I know a hood bitch who'll drop your addy for some hair (Facts)
If we on your bumper, you gon' need more than a prayer (Pussy)
Always wearin' gloves, we ain't doin' nothin' bare (Pussy)
If you ever told, then that's the jacket that you wear (Pussy)
Fuck your past bond, he get out, then he get smacked (Facts)
My youngins ridin' strikers, skats, don't know how to act (21)
Go and ask them niggas, we the reason they run track (21)
Y'all really should be mad at who put batteries in y'all backs (Pussy)
[Chorus: Lil Durk]
If you ever been involved, you can't talk about it (Shh)
I seen a killer do an interview, he tellin', tellin' (You fucked me up)
Why you ain't never clear that rumor up? You know I'm valid (You fucked me up)
See, I ain't respond on Instagram, I know how to go about it (I know how to go about it)
Since he died, just come outside and go to war about him (Bitch-ass)
He say, "No," I'm thinkin' he let a ho got him (Go, go, no)
He say, "No," I say, "Let's go to war about it" (Go, go, no)
Where he go? You better know the morgue got him (Man, what?)
