[Verse 1]
Now, I done grew up round some people livin' their life in bottles
Granddaddy had the golden flask
, 
backstroke every day in Chicago
Some people like the way it feel, 
some people wanna kill their sorrow
Some people wanna fit in with the popular, that was my problem
I was in a dark room, loud tunes
, 
lookin' to make a vow soon
That I'ma get fucked up, fillin' up my cup
 
I see the crowd mood
Changin' by the minute and the record on repeat
Took a sip, then another sip, then somebody said to me
[Chorus]
Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
First, you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock
All the girls wanna play 
Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Po-Pool full of liquor, I'ma dive in it
