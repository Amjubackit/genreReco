[Verse 1: Tory Lanez]
Every time I close my eyes
It seems like nothing helps
Visions of you run my mind
I can't see nothing else
, ooh
Every time I'm in my house
I just can't stop talkin' 'bout you, oh, yeah
Stunning girls and sexy smile, ooh
I don't know what I'm gon' do without my bae
[Pre-Chorus: Tory Lanez]
'Cause I will stop at nothing
You want me to give it, I'll give the world to you
And I will stop at nothing
You want me to give it, I'll give the world to you
[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
So, can we meet again?
If you give me a chance
I know the way this ends
I'll get played in the end (I can feel my heart again)
But can we meet again?
If you give me a chance (When I'm with you)
I know the way this еnds
I'll get played in the еnd[Post-Chorus: Tory Lanez & 
Tee
]
Just say you want me (
Ooh, baby, ooh, baby
)
But you don't want me (
Wanna get with you, baby
)
That don't stop me, baby (
Ooh, baby, ooh, baby
)
That don't stop me, baby (
Ooh, baby, ooh, baby
)
Just say you want me (Say you want me, girl, 
ooh, baby, ooh, baby
)
But she don't want me (She don't want me, 
wanna get with you, baby
)
That don't stop me, baby (That don't stop me, 
ooh, baby, ooh, baby
)
That don't stop me, baby (That don't stop me, 
wanna get with you, baby
)
[Verse 2: Tory Lanez]
Every time that I see her (I see her)
Seems like she got a hold on me, uh
And every time that I need her (I need her)
She's there but really not there for me, ooh
Played my role and dealt my cards (Dealt my cards
)
I let her put it all on me, yeah
Things can only go so far, ooh
'Til one of us quits on three
(
Wouldn't that be a tragedy, baby?
)
[Pre-Chorus: Tory Lanez]
'Cause I will stop at nothing
You want me to give it, I'll give the world to you
And I will stop at nothing
You want me to give it, I'll give the world to you[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
So, can we meet again? (Can we meet again?)
If you give me a chance (Give me a chance)
I know the way this ends (Yeah)
I'll get played in the end (I can feel my heart again)
But can we meet again?
If you give me a chance (When I'm with you)
I know the way this ends
I'll get played in the end (I can feel my heart again)
But can we meet again?
If you give me a chance (When I'm with you)
I know the way this ends
I'll get played in the end
