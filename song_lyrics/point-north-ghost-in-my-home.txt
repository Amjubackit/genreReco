[Verse 1]
I felt the presence of a person that I loved once
And now the only way to get out is to move on
And now I think to myself 'What have I begun?’
She's hiding from the moonlight, could see the world in your eyes
But I was trying to run away at the same time
So sink your teeth in cause now I gotta feel it
Show your face so I got something to believe in
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you’re watching me sleep all night
Can you feel the cold running down your spine
Now I can't erase you from my mind
I know it's gonna hurt a little
[Chorus]
I try to run from you
It's all that I can do
'Cause you're the thorn in my side that I can't pull out now
The pain in my gut when you keep bringing me down
So let me go, 'cause if you’ve gotta know
You’re the ghost in my home and I wanna be alone now
You're keeping me awake ’cause I hate who you've become
[Verse 2]
I hear your voice in my head and it ain't stopping
I just wanna drown it out but I'm eavesdropping
Like a leech on my heart, yeah you’re still sucking
And then you kick me to the dirt like a filthy habit
I'm stepping off the edge 'cause I've got nothing left
And now you're taking back what you said, (yeah)
When you follow me around, you try to keep me down
But I can see right through your intentions[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you're watching me sleep all night
Can you feel the cold running down your spine
Now I can't erase you from my mind
(I know it's gonna hurt a little)
[Chorus]
I try to run from you
It's all that I can do
'Cause you're the thorn in my side that I can't pull out now
The pain in my gut when you keep bringing me down
So let me go, 'cause if you've gotta know
You're the ghost in my home and I wanna be alone now
You're keeping me awake 'cause I hate who you've become
[Bridge]
Thorn in my side that I can't pull out now
Pain in my gut when you keep bringing me down
Ghost in my home and I wanna be alone now
Keeping me awake and I hate who you are now
Thorn in my side that I can't pull out now
Pain in my gut when you keep bringing me down
Ghost in my home and I wanna be alone now
Keeping me awake and I hate who you are now
[Chorus]
I try to run from you
I try to run from you
'Cause you're the thorn in my side that I can't pull out now
The pain in my gut when you keep bringing me down
Let me go, 'cause if you've gotta know
You're the ghost in my home and I wanna be alone now
You're keeping me awake 'cause I hate who you've become
