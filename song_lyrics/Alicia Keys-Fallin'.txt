[Verse 1]
I keep on fallin' in
And outta love with you
Sometimes I love ya, sometimes you make me blue
Sometimes I feel good, at times I feel used
Lovin' you, darlin', makes me so confused
[Chorus]
I keep on fallin' in and out
Of love with you
I never loved someone
The way that I'm lovin' you
[Verse 2]
Oh, oh, I never felt this way
How do you give me so much pleasure
And cause me so much pain? (Yeah, yeah)
Just when I think I've taken more than would a fool
I start fallin' back in love with you
[Chorus]
I keep on fallin' in and out
Of love with you
I never loved someone (Oh, someone)
The way that I'm lovin' you
 (Way I, uh, uh)
