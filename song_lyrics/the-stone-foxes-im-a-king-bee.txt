I'm a king bee
Buzzing round your hive
I'm a king bee
Buzzing round your hive
I can make honey
If you let me come inside
I'm a king bee
Want you to be my queen
I'm a king bee
Want you to be my queen
We could make honey
Like you've never seen
I'm a king bee
I can buzz all night long
I'm a king bee
I can buzz all night long
I can buzz you better
When your man is gone
