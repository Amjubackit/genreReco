[Verse 1]
What a day to meet the master
I've been waiting for so long
Final day to meet the master
It's my time to go home
[Chorus]
And I'm taken, woah
By the madness
And the tripping
And the touching
[Verse 2]
What a day to travel faster
Take my trip around the sun
I have known no other master
He has been the only one
[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, he was the only one
Ooh, the only one
[Chorus]
And I'm taken
By the madness
And the tripping
And the touching
[Bridge]
Ooh, hey
Ooh
Ooh, hey
Ooh
Oh yeah
La-la-la-la
Ram, ram, ram, ram, ram
Ram, ram, ram, ram, ram
Ram, ram, ram
[Outro]
Blow it up to give him
All of our love, all of our love
Blow it up to give him
All of our love, all of our love
Blow it up to give him
All of our lovе, all of our love
All of our love, all of our love
All of our lovе, all of our love
