[Intro]
One two three four
One two
[Chorus]
It's a motorcycle drive by, baby, dry your kind eyes
I think it's about time we headed home
Walkin' on such tight rope with my damn high hopes
Country boys don't die alone
[Verse 1]
Readin' poetry under shade tree, that woman she's my baby
I will be in Richmond by tonight
With so much shame inside me, I just wanna hide me
But they wanna hear me sing my songs under lights
[Chorus]
It's a motorcycle drive by, baby, dry your kind eyes
I think it's about time we headed home
Walkin' on such tight rope with my damn high hopes
That country boys don't die alone
[Verse 2]
Everyday's so fleetin' and I've been tryin'
To save it while I can
The look on her face all these hot humid days
And the boys in my damn band
