[Verse 1]
Girl, this is our town
Back seat with the top down
Got the radio up loud
We're running
We drive from the west side
On back to the east side
No thrill that we can't find
It's coming
[Chorus]
We were halfway through
Making love, making love brand new
And if the end comes soon
I'll be here, I'll be here with you
Making love, making love brand new
Love brand new
[Verse 2]
Run through all the red lights
Still up with the sunrise
White lines in the hillside
Keep coming
Your light never burns out
I don't wanna come down
Can't lose what we just found
For nothing
[Chorus]
We were halfway through
Making love, making love brand new
And if the end comes soon
I'll be here, I'll be here with you
Making love, making love brand new
Love brand new
[Bridge]
We were halfway through
Making love, making love brand new
And if the end comes soon
I'll be here, I'll be here with you
[Chorus]
We were halfway through
Making love, making love brand new (Love brand new)
And if the end comes soon
I'll be here, I'll be here with you (Here with you)
Making love, making love brand new
Love brand new
