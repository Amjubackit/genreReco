[Verse 1]
Sweet Mariona
Long as I've known ya
You were the apple of my eye
All the stars in my sky, I adore ya
[Verse 2]
Sweet Mariona
From California
To the heavens above
I can still feel your love growing stronger
[Chorus]
Over the rainbow
I know that you know
Whenever you cross my mind
The sun's gonna shine
[Verse 3]
Sweet Mariona
Sometimes without warning
I can hear you in the wind
Comin' back to me again and again
[Chorus]
Over the rainbow
I know that you know
Whenever you cross my mind
The sun's gonna shine
