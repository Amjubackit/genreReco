[Verse 1]
I could run a thousand miles to win the race of life, but what's the value?
Without You
I could write a thousand psalms to captivate Your heart, but more than offerings
Lord, You seek through the depths of me
[Chorus]
When You see me
You see my heart
Through the eyes of Your mercy
In the light of Your Son
You love me
With open arms
And the pride of a father
[Verse 2]
I was once a prodigal, burdened by my shame 'til You came running
To remind me
Your love is unconditional, and in Your eyes I'm worthy of forgiveness
Oh, what was lost is now redeemed
[Chorus]
Whеn You see me
You see my heart
Through the еyes of Your mercy
In the light of Your Son
You love me
With open arms
And the pride of a father[Post-Chorus]
Oh, I know You love me (You love me, You love me)
Oh, I know You love me, woah
You'll never leave me
You'll never leave me
By my side, yeah (By my side)
By my side, yeah (By my side)
[Bridge]
Who am I that You love me?
Who am I that You saved my soul?
Who am I without You, Lord?
Who am I to be worthy?
Who am I that You're mindful of me?
Who am I that You call me Yours, mm?
Who am I that You love me?
Who am I that You saved my soul?
Who am I without You, Lord?
And who am I to be worthy?
Who am I that You're mindful of me?
Who am I that You call me Yours, oh, oh?
Who am I that You love me?
Who am I that You saved my soul?
Who am I without You, Lord?
And who am I to be worthy?
Who am I that You're mindful of me?
Who am I that You call me Yours?[Chorus]
When You see me
You see my heart
Through the eyes of Your mercy
In the light of Your Son
You love me
With open arms
And the pride of a father
When You see me
You see my heart
Through the eyes of Your mercy
In the light of Your Son
You love me
With open arms
And the pride of a father
[Outro]
Oh, You love me
And the pride of a father
