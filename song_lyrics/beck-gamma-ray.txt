[Verse 1]
If I could hold
Hold out for now
With these icecaps melting down
With the transistor sound
And my Chevrolet Terraplane
Going around around around
[Chorus 1]
Come on little gamma ray
Standing in a hurricane
Your brains are bored like a refugee from a house that's burning
And the heat wave's calling your name
[Verse 2]
She's got a cactus crown
With a dot dot dot on her brow
And she speaks inside a cloud
With her countenance turning around
[Chorus 2]
It hit me like a gamma ray
Standing in a hurricane and
I'm pulling out thorns
Smokestack lightning out my window
I want to know what I've lost today
[Chorus 3]
Come on little gamma ray
Standing in a hurricane
Your body's bored
Like a refugee from a house that's burning
And the backwater's calling your name
