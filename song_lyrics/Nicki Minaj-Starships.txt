Uh
[Verse 1]
Let's go to the beach-each, let's go get a wave
They say, what they gonna say
Have a drink, clink, found the Bud Light
Bad bitches like me is hard to come by
The Patr√≥n own, let's go get it on
The zone on, yes, I'm in the zone
Is it two, three? Leave a good tip
I'ma blow off my money and don't give two shits, oh-oh
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm on the floor, floor, I love to dance
So give me more, more 'til I can't stand
Get on the floor, floor like it's your last chance
If you want more, more, then here I am
[Chorus]
Starships were meant to fly
Hands up and touch the sky (
Oh-oh-oh-oh
)
Can't stop 'cause we're so high
Let's do this one more time (
Oh-oh-oh-oh
)
Starships, were meant to fly
Hands up and touch the sky (
Oh-oh-oh-oh
)
Let's do this one last time
Can't stop
