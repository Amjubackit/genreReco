[Intro]
Mm-mm-mm
(GlobalKnockz got the recipe)
Ayy, just thinking 'bout the way you make me feel
It's so, it's so real
[Chorus]
2 AM, the night still young
You live by the gun, you gon' die by the gun
Ain't no handouts for nobody
When I ain't had shit, they ain't offer me nothin'
When I'm quiet, I be thinking 'bout killings
A lot of niggas bitch-made, stay in they feelings
Saving these hoes, this shit here pitiful
All these lil' bitty bitches my chillens, ooh
And Mama, don't worry
You raised a gangster, I'm a survivor
It hurt me
Not being able to give you what you want since I was a toddler
Shout out to my pops for all the free game
Everything you evеr told me, it stuck in my brain
Real OG status and like to makе a change
Shedded tears writin' this, seen so much pain
[Verse]
All the sheisty shit that I've done, blessed to not be in no chains
Uncle killed me when I was young, Mama blessed the boy with the cocaine
Growing up, I ain't have no daddy, my mama played both roles
Been hard on a nigga since I came out the womb, yeah, the pussy hole
I was taught to trust none
Face your problems, never run
Lil' bitch holler she pregnant
You a lil' nat-nat, that ain't my son
Tryna trap me, know I had a glove
Fuck them feelings, slatt, I'm a thug
You a lil' dusty ho, you're the rug
Ayy, and it's still fuck love
[Chorus]
2 AM, the night still young
You live by the gun, you gon' die by the gun
Ain't no handouts for nobody
When I ain't had shit, they ain't offer me nothin'
When I'm quiet, I be thinking 'bout killings
A lot of niggas bitch-made, stay in they feelings
Saving these hoes, this shit here pitiful
All these lil' bitty bitches my chillens, ooh
And Mama, don't worry
You raised a gangster, I'm a survivor
It hurt me
Not being able to give you what you want since I was a toddler
Shout out to my pops for all the free game
Everything you ever told me, it stuck in my brain
Real OG status and like to make a change
Shedded tears writin' this, seen so much pain
[Outro]
