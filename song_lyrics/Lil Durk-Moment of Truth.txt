[Intro]

Ayy, pull up, Lam

[Verse 1]
You don't step up, if they dead, then your shit gon' crumble
I had to text like I was my mans to get her number
I'm not normal, but you decide to be in a jungle
Don't like my songs, when you around me, you gon' try to bump it
A couple killers cut off personally 'cause they mouth runnin'
You fuck raw, you paranoid as hell, you think you got somethin'
You was in my Cash App feed, you know you ain't got money
And I sent you money every time you asked even though you lied to me
How you let a nigga starve from your block knowin' he ain't got nothin'?
How you missin' commissary bags? Your block got money
Hundred thousand in a Goyard bag, it look like small money
You ain't hеlp the day my brothers died, you niggas ain't ridе with me
I ain't gon' speak on the past, when I took it serious, I had dime bitches
Twenty-six years, talked to my uncle, I did time with him
I ain't have shit, still sent money off, I'm that nigga
I ain't have shit, when I hit a lick, I gave a five-fifty
[Chorus]
True story, don't lie to me
True story, my life ain't that easy
True story, they act like they ain't need me
True story, get me locked up at the meetin'
True story, I really wasn't eatin'
Gettin' to that money, I'm out all night, she think I'm cheatin'
Hustler music, I told her to listen to that and take it easy
I'm out all night, she think I'm cheatin'
