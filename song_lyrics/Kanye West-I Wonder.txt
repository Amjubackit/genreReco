[Intro: Labi Siffre]
Find your dreams come true
And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means to find your dreams
And I wonder
[Verse 1: Kanye West & 
Labi Siffre
]
I've been waiting on this my whole life
 (
And I wonder
)
These dreams be waking me up at night
 (
And I wonder
)
You say I think I'm never wrong
 (
And I wonder
)
You know what? Maybe you're right, aight?
[Chorus: Labi Siffre]
And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means to find your dreams
And I wonder
[Verse 2: Kanye West & 
Labi Siffre
]
You say he get on your fucking nerves (
And I wonder
)
You hope that he get what he deservesâ€”word! (
And I wonder
)
Do you even remember what the issue is?
You just trying to find where the tissue is
You can still be who you wish you is
It ain't happen yet, and that's what intuition is
 (
And I wonder
)
When you hop back in the car
Drive back to the crib, run back to they arms
The smokescreens, the chokes and the screams
You ever wonder what it all really means?
