Well I needed you and not just someone
I’ve been so long failing you dear
I said I’d care for all of this darling
Yet I buried all of it again
Ah yeah come on baby
Yeah it could be good
Honey
It’s just the two
Of us now
Now that all seems dark and light has gone away
I’ve been out there bending in the wind
Now I’m standing here to be beside you
And for all I know and all I care
I said don’t you weep and don’t you worry
Don’t you weep and don’t you worry
Don’t you weep and don’t you worry
Don’t you weep and don’t you worry
Don’t you weep and don’t you worry
Don’t you weep and don’t you worry
Don’t you weep and don’t you worry
I’ve been failing you
I’ve been failing you
I’ve been failing you
I’ve been failing youBut I can’t stop trying
But I can’t stop trying
But I can’t stop trying
Oh I can’t stop trying
Oh I can’t stop trying
Oh I can’t stop trying
Oh I can’t stop trying
Oh I can’t stop trying
Oh I can’t stop trying
Oh but I can’t stop trying
Oh I can’t stop trying
