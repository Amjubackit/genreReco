[Verse 1]
You sit there in your heartache
Waiting on some beautiful boy to
To save you from your old ways
You play forgiveness
Watch it now, here he comes
[Chorus 1]
He doesn't look a thing like Jesus
But he talks like a gentlemen
Like you imagined
When you were young
[Verse 2]
Can we climb this mountain? I don't know
Higher now than ever before
I know we can make it if we take it slow
Let's take it easy
Easy now, watch it go
[Chorus 2]
We're burning down the highway skyline
On the back of a hurricane that started turning
When you were young
When you were young
