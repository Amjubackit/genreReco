[Verse]
Hit me like a tidal wave
Take away the ground beneath my feet
Take me to a higher place, yeah
You know you know you know what I mean
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, yeah it’s gonna be a long night
And I, I been waiting for a long time
(1, 2, 3, 4)
[Chorus]
Get up, get down
Get up, get down
[Verse]
Hit me like a tidal wave
Take away the ground beneath my feet
Take me to a higher place, yeah
You know you know you know what I mean
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, yeah it’s gonna be a long night
And I, I been waiting for a long time
(1, 2, 3, 4)
[Chorus]
Get up, get down
Get up, get down
