[Verse 1]
Listenin' to 
Gillian Welch
Ooh, I can't help myself
Look at Miss Ohio
That ain't how you smile though
I like it when you
Talk down, turn the radio down
I like it when you
Talk down, turn the radio down
Listen to The Band by The Band
Honey, I hold your hand
Your eyes look tired
I like it when you
Talk down, turn the radio down
I like it when you
Talk down, turn the radio down
[Chorus]
And when you speak
I might bend to listen to you
Hallelujah, my God
Fast asleep in the back of my car
I like it when you talk do-o-o-own
I like it when you talk do-o-o-own
And when you speak
I might bend to listen to you
Hallelujah, my God
Windows foggin' up in my car
I like it when you talk do-o-o-own
I like it when you talk do-o-o-own[Verse 2]
(Verse two, let's do it)
You put on Liz Phair
And you lean back in your chair
Then you turn the dial low
I got fifty miles
I like it when you
Talk down, turn the radio down
I like it when you
Talk down, turn the radioâ€”
Every little kiss
Or Nebraska
, you blush when I ask ya
Questions 'bout your past, ah
I like it when you
Talk down, turn the radio down
I like it when you
Talk down, turn the radio down
[Chorus]
And when you speak
I might bend to listen to you
Hallelujah, my God
Fast asleep in the back of my car
I like it when you talk do-o-o-own
I like it when you talk do-o-o-own
And when you speak
I might bend to listen to you
Hallelujah, my God (My God)
Windows foggin' up in my car
I like it when you talk do-o-o-own
I like it when you talk do-o-o-own
