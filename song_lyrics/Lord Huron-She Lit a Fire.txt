[Intro]
Hey-eh eh, hey, eh eh
[Verse 1]
I've been through the desert and I've been 'cross the sea
I've been walking through the mountains, I've wandered through the trees for her
I have been trying to find her, want to give what I got
She lit a fire, and now she's in my every thought
[Refrain 1]
Hey-eh, eh, eh eh
Hey-eh eh, hey, eh eh
Hey-eh, eh, eh eh
Hey-eh eh, hey, eh eh
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Where could that girl have gone?
Where? I've wandered far
Where could that girl have gone?
She left no trail, but I cannot fail; I will find her
[Chorus]
(Hey-eh, eh, eh eh)
She lit a fire, and now she's in my every thought
(Hey-eh, eh, eh eh)
She lit a fire, and now she's in my every thought
