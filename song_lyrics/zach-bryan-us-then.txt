[Intro]
One, two, three, four
[Verse 1]
Well the buildings out in Brooklyn are taller than the clouds
And I don't like who I am
 
Sunday morning comin' down
Tequila out in Texas is tougher on the tongue
Than the devil that I met in Oklahoma when I's young
[Verse 2]
I miss that old ball cap you stole from me
Out in the woods around a fire in Eastern Tennessee
And the beatin' that I got from them boys in Baton Rouge
Was nothin' like the beatin' that I got from lovin' you
[Chorus]
Take me back to us then
Where the times told true
And the sun does shine on a lawn chair holdin' you
Take me back to us then
Where there's a warm, warm light
Radiatin' off a cheap smile
Oh my, I could die tonight
[Verse 3]
That creek we jumped in while you were shakin' cold
I never thought such heat would grow dry and old
Takes blood and guts just to get to where we were
Put on your dancin' shoes, I'll be him and you be her[Chorus]
Take me back to us then
Where the times told true
And the sun does shine on a lawn chair holdin' you
Take me back to us then
Where there's a warm, warm light
Radiatin' off a cheap smile
Oh my, I could die tonight
[Outro]
So take me back to us then
There's a warm, warm light
Radiatin' off a cheap smile
Oh my, I could die tonight
