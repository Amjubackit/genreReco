[Verse 1: Matt Berninger]
Memorize the bathwater, memorize the air
There'll come a time I'll wanna know I was here
Names on the doorframes, inches and ages
Handprints in concrete at the softest stages
[Refrain: Matt Berninger]
I don't know why I don't try harder
I feel like throwin' towels into water
[Verse 2: Matt Berninger]
Get it down to nothin', everything that matters
Fever flashes, eyelashes and traffic patterns
Humidity, history, chemistry and panic
Swimsuits in the windows of electric minivans
[Refrain: Matt Berninger with Justin Vernon]
I don't know why I don't try harder
I've been goin' down some, some strange water
[Pre-Chorus: Matt Berninger, 
 together with Justin Vernon
]
Move forward now
, there's nothin' to do
Can't turn around
, I can't follow you
Your coat's in my car, I guess you forgot
It's crazy the things we let go of
It finally hits me, a mile's drive
The sky is leaking, the windshield's crying
I'm feelin' sacred, my soul is stripped
Radio's painful, the words are clipped[Chorus: Matt Berninger with Justin Vernon]
The grief it gets me, the weird goodbyes
My car is creepin', I think it's dyin'
I'm pullin' over until it heals
I'm on a shoulder of lemon fields
[Bridge: Matt Berninger]
What was I even leavin' for?
I keep goin' back and forth
I think now I'm about to see
Didn't know how sad it'd be
[Verse 3: Matt Berninger]
Memorize the bathwater, memorize the air
There'll come a time I'll wanna know when I was here
Names on the doorframes, inches and ages
Handprints in concrete at the softest stages
[Refrain: Matt Berninger with Justin Vernon]
I don't know why I don't try harder
I feel like throwin' towels into water
[Pre-Chorus: Matt Berninger, 
 together with Justin Vernon
]
Move forward now
, there's nothin' to do
Can't turn around
, I can't follow you
Your coat's in my car, I guess you forgot
It's crazy the things we let go of
It finally hits me, a mile's drive
The sky is leaking, the windshield's crying
I'm feelin' sacred, my soul is stripped
Radio's painful, the words are clipped[Chorus: Matt Berninger with Justin Vernon]
The grief it gets me, the weird goodbyes
My car is creepin', I think it's dyin'
I'm pullin' over until it heals
I'm on a shoulder of lemon fields
The grief it gets me, the weird goodbyes
My car is creepin', I think it's dyin'
I'm pullin' over until it heals
I'm on a shoulder of lemon fields
