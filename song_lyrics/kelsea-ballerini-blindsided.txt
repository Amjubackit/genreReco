[Verse 1]
Were you on the other line or driving in your car?
Were you hiding upstairs or playing your guitar?
Was there nothing ever wrong, 'cause you were always right?
Tell me, were you blindsided or were you just blind?
[Chorus]
And now you're saying that you're lost
And that's lost on me
Years of sitting across from me in therapy
I know the truth is hard to hear, but it wasn't hard to find
Baby, were you blindsided or were you just blind?
[Verse 2]
I'd go write a song, and you'd go for a walk
We had to get drunk to ever really talk
I told you what I needed, didn't have to rеad my mind
So, were you blindsided or wеre you just blind?
[Chorus]
And now you're saying that you're lost, and that's lost on me
You didn't ever wanna leave the house, I didn't want a family
I know the truth is hard to hear, but it wasn't hard to find
Baby, were you blindsided or were you just blind?
[Bridge]
Like that one time in 2019, before that big show, we had a big fight
I slept on the couch and then the next night you put on your suit
I put on a smile and sang about how it's okay to cry, dying inside
[Chorus]
And now you're saying that you're lost, and that's lost on me
Tell me, when did I start looking like the enemy?
I know the truth is hard to hear, you've got yours and I've got mine
Baby, were you blindsided or were you just blind?
Were you just blind?
(It's not fucking news to you, babe)
(You've been in this relationship, it's not news to you)
[Outro]
Were you, were you just blind
Were you, were you just
Baby, were you, were you just blind? Yeah
Were you just
Were you, were you just
Were you just blind?
[alternate verse from SNL:]
Now you're singing it loud on the radio
You couldn't say it to my face
You would have searched the whole world over?
Yeah. Sure. Okay
Now you're singing it loud on the radio
Like you're the only heart that breaks
You would have searched the whole world over?
Yeah. Sure. Okay
