[Verse 1]
Oh, the pain of letting you go
Under my skin so I cut you out
Oh, I only know everything that I know
They were just your words coming out of my mouth
[Chorus]
Thundering voices loud and clear
(Oh oh oh)
Speaking the truth for all to hear
(Oh oh oh)
Thundering voices loud and clear
[Verse 2]
Heartache in a wounded knee
Killing and haunting and tormenting me
Well a blind eye would never see
Pulling my strings just to please yourself
[Chorus]
Thundering voices loud and clear
(Oh oh oh)
Speaking the truth for all to hear
(Oh oh oh)
Thundering voices loud and clearLove knows no boundaries
No walls
No fence
We are landing
No lies
No death
[Chorus]
Thundering voices loud and clear
(Oh oh oh)
Speaking the truth for all to hear
(Oh oh oh)
Thundering voices loud and clear
(Oh oh oh)
Speaking the truth for all to hear
(Oh oh oh)
Thundering voices loud and clear
(Oh oh oh)
Speaking the truth for all to hear
