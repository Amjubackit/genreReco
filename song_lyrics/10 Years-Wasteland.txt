[Intro]
Change my attempt, good intentions
[Verse 1]
Crouched over, you were not there, living in fear
But signs were not really that scarce, obvious tears
But I will not hide you through this, I want you to help them
Please see the bleeding heart perched on my shirt
Die, withdraw, hide in cold sweat, quivering lips
Ignore remorse, naming a kid, living wasteland
This time you've tried all that you can, turning you red
[Chorus]
Change my attempt, good intentions
Should I? Could I?
Here we are with your obsession
Should I? Could I?
[Verse 2]
Crowned, hopeless, the article read, "living wasteland"
This time you've tried all that you can, turning you red
But I will not hide you through this, I want you to help
[Chorus]
Change my attempt, good intentions
Should I? Could I?
Here we are with your obsession
Should I? Could I?
