[Verse 1]
There is no shadow that has ever overcome Your light
And there is no rival that could ever stand against Your might
You've always been with us
Every battle, You've already won, oh, we've already won
[Verse 2]
There is no weapon that has ever left a mark on You
And there is no army with the power to conquer truth
You've always been with us
Every battle, You've already won, we've already won
[Chorus]
Show me one thing He can't do
Show me a mountain He can't move
He's the God of the breakthrough
And anything is possible, 
hey
Show me one thing that's too hard
Show me waters He can't part
He's the God of the breakthrough
And anything is possible, is possible, 
hey
[Verse 3]
There is a kingdom that's advancing at the speed of light
And in His kingdom every dead thing is bound to rise
Oh, God, our Redeemer
He is faithful to revive, oh, He will revive, 
hey[Chorus]
Show me one thing He can't do
Show me a mountain He can't move
He's the God of the breakthrough
And anything is possible, 
do you believe it?
Show me one thing that's too hard
Show me waters He can't part
He's the God of the breakthrough
And anything is possible, 
hey, hey
[Bridge]
Now, all of my fear I will turn into praise
Shake off despair as I sing out Your name
A victory dance, I will dance loud in faith
I will crush disappointment and break every chain
Oh, all of my fear I will turn into praise
Shake off despair as I sing out Your name
A victory dance, I will dance loud in faith
I will crush disappointment and break every chain
All of my fear, I will turn into praise
Shake off despair as I sing out Your name
A victory dance, I will dance loud in faith
I will crush disappointment
[Chorus]
Show me one thing He can't do
Show me a mountain He can't move
He's the God of the breakthrough
And anything is possible, 
yes, He is
Show me one thing that's too hard
Show me waters He can't part
He's the God of the breakthrough
And anything is possible[Outro]
Anything is possible
Anything is possible
Shout out to God with a voice of triumph
