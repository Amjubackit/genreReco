[Intro]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
[Verse 1]
Mama taught her how to please
Daddy begged them not to leave
But they drove to the City of Angels
Mama knows, baby girl gon' be famous (Yeah)
Mama died after fallen dreams
Suicide made her tabloid queen
[Pre-Chorus]
She's alone, the city gon' break her
There's no one, there's no one to save her, oh-oh
[Chorus]
He watches over like a God
Makes you hurt again, so you can heal and say "Amen"
We will change for you
We will cry for you
We will pay for you
Give our lives to you, oh-oh-oh
[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
We will change for you
We will cry for you
We will pay for you
Give our lives to you, oh-oh-oh
[Verse 2]
Baby boy was doing petty crimes
Twenty-five, he was serving time
He would dream of the City of Angels
He was born to entertain us, 'tain us, 'tain us
At his core, he's just a jealous guy
Many women falling for his lie
[Pre-Chorus]
He's alone, the city will break him
'Cause there's no, there's no one to save him, oh-oh-oh
[Chorus]
She watches over like a God
Makes you hurt again so you can heal and say "Amen"
We will change for you
We will cry for you
We will pay for you
Give our lives to you, oh-oh-oh
[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh
We will change for you
We will cry for you
We will pay for you
Give our lives to you
[Outro]
We will change for you
We will cry for you
We will pay for you
End our lives for you, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh
We will change for you
We will cry for you
We will pay for you
Give our lives to you, oh-oh-oh
