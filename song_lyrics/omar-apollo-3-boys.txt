[Verse 1]
I don't wanna see any of your friends
I don't
I know it's hard for you to be alone
But that's where we're different
I'd be emotionless all the way if I could
I should take your advice and find someone new
So I could have two
[Pre-Chorus]
I don't want to
Fell asleep with your hand on my skull and my face
In your lap
At the Bowery Hotel, missing you
How did I fall so fast?
Seems like everything I do take me further from you
[Chorus]
Three boys would work if I wasn't so tethered to you
 (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
What should I do? (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
I can't even choose (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
I'm tethered to you, hey (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
[Verse 2]
You pray to God that it would leave (It won't lеave)
All that you feel for me (All that you feel)
It won't be light, it won't feel right
My hand around your nеck that you're tortured by
Spend a lot of time with you, I can't let go
I know there's some things you can't speak
But thoughts of a third make me weak, weak[Pre-Chorus]
I don't want to
Fell asleep with your hand on my skull and my face
In your lap
At the Bowery Hotel, missing you
How did I fall so fast?
Seems like everything I do take me further from you
[Chorus]
Three boys would work if I wasn't so tethered to you (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
What should I do? (What should I do?)
I can't even choose (I can't even choose)
I'm tethered to you, hey (I'm tethered to you)
[Outro]
To you
