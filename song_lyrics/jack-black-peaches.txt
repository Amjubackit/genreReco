[Intro]
This one is for my one and only true love
Princess Peach
[Verse 1]
Peach, you're so cool
And with my star, we're gonna rule
Peach, understand
I'm gonna love you 'til the very end
[Chorus]
Peaches, Peaches, Peaches, Peaches, Peaches
Peaches, Peaches, Peaches, Peaches, Peaches
I love you, oh
Peaches, Peaches, Peaches, Peaches, Peaches
Peaches, Peaches, Peaches, Peaches, Peaches
I love you, oh
[Verse 2]
Mario, Luigi, and a Donkey Kong, too
A thousand troops of Koopas couldn't keep me from you
Princess Peach, at the end of the line
I'll make you mine, oh
[Chorus]
Peaches, Peaches, Peaches, Peaches, Peaches
Peaches, Peaches, Peaches, Peaches, Peaches
I love you, oh
[Outro]
Peaches, Peaches
Peach, Peach
