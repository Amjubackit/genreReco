[Verse 1]
It's a junked out joint off a backroad
A blinkin' window sign with an arrow
A gravel Iot chock full o' toolbox trucks
Makin' their happy hour way home
[Pre-Chorus]
When guys like me lose girls like you
That's where we run to
[Chorus]
They got "Whiskey River" on the jukebox
A honky tonk sawdust dance floor
A neon, five o'clock, pro clock
And plenty damn many when you want one more
This broke-heart fool on an old bar stool
Drinkin' beer almost as cold as you
[Verse 2]
Bunch of good time numbers on the stall door
A picture o' you on the dart board
Them cinder block walls ain't ever been cleaned
Still ain't as dirty as you done me
[Chorus]
"Whiskey River" on the jukebox
A honky-tonk sawdust dance floor
A neon, five o'clock, pro clock
And plenty damn many when you want one more
This broke-heart fool on an old bar stool
Drinkin' beer almost as cold as you
