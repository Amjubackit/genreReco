[Verse 1]
I am floating in deep water
Like the unfamiliar otter
In love with someone's daughter
I'm going to lose float
[Verse 2]
And I know that I love her
For the stars and all they cover
Have told me of no other
Quite like her
[Pre-Chorus]
Hope you don't mind, love
But I wrote you a song
Standin' in time, love
I hope you'll sing along
[Chorus]
And I don't understand
How it all began
And I don't understand
How it'll end
How will it end?
Will it end?
