[Verse 1: Thundercat]
Brought in a world
A world so brand new, endless possibilities
A whole new identity
Can't you see? Black gold of the sun
Open up your eyes, open up your heart
Can you feel the sunshine? Let love in
I just wanna be where I'm supposed to be
And that's right here with you
[Verse 2: Thundercat]
Don't mistake my kindness for weakness
'Cause I'm strong, you see
Stronger than you'll ever be
Loyal to the end, someone to call a friend
Whenever you need me, I'll bе right here
Love and loyalty, trust and honеsty
I'll never let go
