[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
I know you gon' lose it, this new Snoop shit
Come on, baby boo, you gots to get into it
Don't fool with the player with the cool whip
Yeah, yeah, you know I'm always on that cool shit
Walk to it, do it how you do it
Have a glass, let me put you in the mood, and
Little cutie, looking like a student
Long hair with your big fat booty
Back in the days, you was a girl I went to school with
Had to tell your moms and sister to cool it
The girl wanna do it, I just might do it
Hit her up with some pimp-pimp fluid
Mommy, don't worry, I won't abuse it
Hurry up and finish so we can watch 
Clueless
I laugh at these niggas when they ask, "Who do this?"
But everybody know, ooh, girl, that you is
