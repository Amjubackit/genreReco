[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Takin' my baby to school, then I pray for her
'Cause you bitches ain't never been cool, writin' testament
Paintin' pictures, put me in the Louvre, that's a definite
Universal shift, I'm in a groove
And celebrity do not mean integrity, you fool
I'm a good man, shake your hand, firm grip rule
Seventy-two wins, lost ten, ballin' with the flu
More than two M's for a show, but add another two
Hmm, lil' Man-Man, the big mans
The GT Dyno flippin' the kickstand, ooh
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & 
Sam Dew
]
Rich nigga, broke phone (
Ah
)
Tryna keep the balance, I'm stayin' strong (
Ooh
)
Stop playin' with me 'fore I turn you to a song (
Yeah
)
Stop playin' with me 'fore I turn you to a song (
Ooh
)
Ayy, bitch, I'm attractive
 (
Ah
)
Can't fuck with you no more, I'm fastin', ugh (
Ooh
)
Bitch, I'm attractive (
Ah, ah, ah, ah
)
Can't fuck with you no more, I'm fastin', ugh
[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
The morality can wait, 
feedback on low latency
, I'm glitching from the face
As my thoughts grow sacredly, I'm runnin' out of space
Ask Whitney, she okay, never mind a hundred K
Why you lyin' on Benjamin? He turnin' in his grave
I'd be lyin' if I said I wouldn't give this shit away
The aloof Buddha
, 
I'm Christ with a shooter
Praise to Muhammad, I might nigga noose ya
AP, Michael Friedman, my friends cooler
Primary, so the resale value stupid
I would never live my life on a computer
IG'll get you life for a chikabooya
More power to ya, love 'em from a distance
Why you always in the mirror more than the bitches?
And my cousin tried to sue me like he got the privilege
But I didn't lose sleep 'cause I got the spirit
, ayy (Ooh)
