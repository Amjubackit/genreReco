Take a little sip
Have a little trip but don't you know we're going nowhere
But I'm feeling like I feel alright
Don't you let it slip, don't you lose your grip
Don't let us vanish into thin air
We can't be feeling like, I feel alright
And we're gonna break and break this tide
Cause we just can't kiss and wait tonight
November 21, when the night felt younger
When we danced into our daydreams
You had me feeling like, I feel alright
឵឵឵Off for somewhere new
But it feels insane no way you know you're going nowhere
We should be feeling like, I feel alright
And we're gonna wake and break this tide
Cause we just can't kiss and wait tonight
And we're gonna break and wake this tide
Cause we just can't kiss and wait tonight
