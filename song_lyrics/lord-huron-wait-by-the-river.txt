[Verse 1]
I will wait by the river in the light of the moon
At the edge of the city, I will wait for you
Though I can't wait forever, someday I'll be dead and gone
And I won't be forgiven for what I've done
[Hook]
I will wait by the river
I will wait by the river
I will wait by the river
I will wait by the river
[Verse 2]
I will cry out to heaven as it rains down on me
I will beg for forgiveness, get down on my knees
If I can't change the weather, maybe I can change your mind
If we can't be together, what's the point of life?
[Bridge]
Baby, I didn't mean the things I said
I don't honestly wish you were dead
I'm a fool, I'm just a man
If I only could hold you again
[Verse 3]
And the stars fill the river as it flows into the sky
And the mind leaves the body and floats higher and higher
If we can't be together, I will leave this world behind
If I can't touch your body, can I touch the sky?
[Hook]
I will wait by the river
I will wait by the river
I will wait by the river
I will wait by the river
