[Verse 1]
I'm a stone's throw from the mill
And I'm a good walk to the river
When my workin' day is over
We'll go swim our cares away
Put your toes down in the water
And a smile across your face
And tell me that you love me
Lovely Lady May
[Verse 2]
Now I ain't the sharpest chisel
That your hands have ever held
But darlin' I could love you well
'Til the roll is called on high
I've seen my share of trouble
And I've held my weight in shame
But I'm baptized in your name
Lovely Lady May
[Verse 3]
Lord the wind can leave you shiverin'
As it waltzes o'er the leaves
It's been rushin' through my timber
'Til your love brought on the spring
Now the mountains all are blushin'
And they don't know what to say
'Cept a good long line of praises
For my lovely Lady May
