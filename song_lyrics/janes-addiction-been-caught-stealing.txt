[Verse 1]
I've been caught stealing
Once when I was 5
I enjoy stealing
It's just as simple as that
Oh well, it's just a simple fact
When I want something, man
I don't wanna pay for it
[Chorus 1]
Now I walk right
Through the door
And I walked right through the door
Hey, all right!
If I get by
It's all mine
Mine all mine
Hey!
[Verse 2]
Yeah, my girl, she's one too
She'll go and get her a skirt
Stick it under her shirt
She grabbed a razor for me
And she did it just like that
When she wants something, man
She don't wanna pay for it[Chorus 2]
She'll walk right
Through the door
Walked right through the door
Hey, all right!
If I get by
It's all mine
Mine all mine
Let's go!
[Bridge]
La la la la
Dah dah dah dah
Dah dah dah dah
Dah dah dah dah
Dah dah
La la la la
Dah dah dah dah
Dah dah dah dah
Dah dah dah dah
Dah dah
Ah!
[Verse 3]
Sat around the pile
Sat and laughed
Sat and laughed and waved 'em into the air
And we did it just like that
When we want something, man
We don't wanna pay for it[Chorus 3]
We walk right
Through the door
Walked right through the door
Hey, all right!
If I get by
It's uh
Mine, mine, uh
Mine uh, mine uh
Mine, mine, mine, uh
Mine all mine
It's all mine
