[Intro: Anderson .Paak]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, say
[Verse 1: Anderson .Paak]
I keep tryna tell ya, you can't keep me on a leash
No matter how hard you train me
I'll do what I want in the end, and you can't disagree
But they make it so hard to be faithful
They make it so hard on me
The top of the day, baby, look what they wearin'
I'm just headed up the street, they ain't carin'
[Hook: Anderson .Paak]
Yeah, and every time I try to mind my own business
She gon' come around and make me so tempted
She gon' ask me when I'm gon', gon' get it
Lord, can you help me? Get me out of here
And I want to keep the peace, it's so hard for me
[Verse 2: Anderson .Paak]
You keep tryna tell me
It's only as hard as you think
No matter what broad you bangin'
You know who you love in the end
And I can't disagree
But lately I'm tryna be faithful
As long as I'm off the drink
She look like she married, but why is she starin'?
She think I'm afraid to reach, don't dare me
