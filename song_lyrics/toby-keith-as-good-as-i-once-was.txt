[Verse 1]
She said, "I've seen you in here before."
I said, "I've been here a time or two."
She said, "Hello, my name is Bobby Jo
Meet my twin sister Betty Lou
And we're both feeling kinda wild tonight
You're the only cowboy in this place
And if you're up for a rodeo
I'll put a big Texas smile on your face"
I said, "Girls,"
[Chorus]
I ain't as good as I once was
I got a few years on me now
But there was a time back in my prime
When I could really lay it down
And if you need some love tonight
Then I might have just enough
I ain't as good as I once was
But I'm as good once as I ever was
[Verse 2]
I still hang out with my best friend Dave
I've known him since we were kids at school
Last night he had a few shots
Got in a tight spot hustling a game of pool
With a couple of redneck boys
One great big bad biker man
I heard David yell across the room
"Hey buddy, how 'bout a helping hand?"
I said, "Dave,"
