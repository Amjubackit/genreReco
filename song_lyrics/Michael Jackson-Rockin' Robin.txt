[Intro]
Tweedily-deedily-dee, tweedily-deedily-dee
Tweedily-deedily dee, tweedily-deedily-dee
Tweedily-deedily dee, tweedily-deedily-dee
Tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet
[Pre-Chorus]
He rocks in the tree tops all day long
Hopping and a-bopping and singing his song
All the little birdies on Jaybird Street
Love to hear the robin go tweet, tweet, tweet
[Chorus]
Rockin' robin, rock, rock
Rockin' robin
Blow, rockin' robin
'Cause we're really gonna rock tonight
[Verse 1]
Every little swallow, every chick-a-dee
Every little bird in the tall oak tree
The wise old owl, the big black crow
Flapping their wings singing, "Go, bird, go"
[Chorus]
Rockin' robin, rock, rock
Rockin' robin
Blow, rockin' robin
'Cause we're really going to rock tonight
Yeah, yeah!
