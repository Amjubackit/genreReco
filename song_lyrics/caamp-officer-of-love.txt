[Verse 1]
Baby blue bandana drives by in a pickup truck
Got a white stripe right down the side, tires on the mud
[Chorus]
She is an officer of love and I'll obey her every word
She is an officer of love and I'll obey her every word
[Verse 2]
Stand up on my shoulders
And tell me, darling, what can you see?
Ten thousand holy rollers going to battle
Cigarettes tucked up in their sleeves
[Chorus]
She is an officer of love and I'll obey her every word
She is an officer of lovе and I'll obey her evеry word
[Verse 3]
We take our loving on the run quite seriously
I'm wondering if she's got a gun hidden up her sleeve
Now stand up on my shoulders
And tell me, honey, what can you see?
Ten thousand holy rollers
Going to battle, plain white tees[Chorus]
She is an officer of love and I'll obey her every word
She is an officer of love and I'll obey her every word
She is an officer of love and I'll obey her every word
She is an officer of love and I'll obey her every word
[Outro]
Every word, every word, start a fire
Baby blue, baby blue
