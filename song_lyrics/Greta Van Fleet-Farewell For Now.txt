[Verse 1]
We have shared with you our stories
Had ourselves a really big time
Fought in battles far from the homeland
Made love, even drank from the wine
[Chorus]
And I wish we all could stay
But I bid you a farewell
And it means the world to play
But I bid you a farewell
[Verse 2]
Friends who've come so far to join us
We hope you come and join us again
Friends who've come to sing in the chorus
You floor us, we will sing to the end
[Chorus]
And I wish we all could stay
But I bid you a farewell
And it means the world to play
But I bid you a farеwell
[Bridge]
Yeah, yeah, yеah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah
