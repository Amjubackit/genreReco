[Verse 1]
Sexy girl, I just fell in love
You should try it, it's a hell of a drug
Like OMG, you make me com-com-complete
I'm looking for reasons, I'm begging and pleading
I'm dreaming of calling you mine
You keep me stu-stu-stuttering, stumbling
Fumbling over my lines
Without you, girl, I'm not alright
I'm not okay, yeah
[Chorus]
No, don't give up on me
Wait, it's not what it seems
Now we can't stop this tragedy
And it's back to the start, yeah, yeah
And we're falling apart, yeah, yeah
[Verse 2]
Sexy girl, come and lay with me
I'm frustrated, and it's sexually
Like OMG, you make me 
com-com-complete
I'm just being honest, I'm creeping and crawling
I'm kissing the top of your head
We're rocking and rolling, we're touching and moaning
And making a mess of your bed
Can someone help? She shot me dead
I can't be saved, yeah
