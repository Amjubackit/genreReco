[Verse 1: Kane Brown]
I was lost, you found a way to bring me back
Needed forgiveness, you always gave me that
Girl, I'm a witness of your love 'cause you don't be givin' up
And it's crazy how you saved me
[Pre-Chorus: Kane Brown]
Hand on the Bible
Don't know how I got you
But I couldn't ask for more
Girl, what we got's worth thanking God for
[Chorus: Kane Brown, 
Both

So thank God 
I get to wake up by your side
And thank God 
your hand fits perfectly in mine
And thank God 
you loved me when you didn't have to
But you did and you do a
nd He knew
Thank God for giving me you (
Hey, yeah
)
Thank God, thank God (
Oh, yeah
)
For giving me you
[Verse 2: Katelyn Brown]
Never thought I'd find an angel undercover
Made a change to everything from my hеart to my last name, hey
Hard to tell whеn he fell that boy was Heaven sent
And every night when I close my eyes before I say "amen"
