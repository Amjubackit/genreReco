[Verse 1]
I was dreamin' of the past
And my heart was beatin' fast
I began to lose control
I began to lose control
[Chorus]
I didn't mean to hurt you
I'm sorry that I made you cry
I didn't mean to hurt you
I'm just a jealous guy
[Verse 2]
I was feelin' insecure
You might not love me anymore
I was shiverin' inside
I was shiverin' inside
[Chorus]
I didn't mean to hurt you, yeah
I'm sorry that I made you cry
I didn't mean to hurt you
I'm just a jealous guy
[Bridge]
Jealous guy
Jealous guy, oh
Jealous guy
Said I'm sorry, jealous guy
[Chorus]
I didn't mean to hurt you
I'm sorry that I made you cry
I didn't wanna hurt you
I'm just a jealous guy
