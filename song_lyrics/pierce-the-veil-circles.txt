[Verse 1]
Listen, do you hear my heart beat thump over the monitors?
You pretend to close your eyes, don't breathe in
Pieces of candy and leaks of light (Leaks of light, light)
Paint the floor 'round me, then without hesitating
(Hesitating)
[Chorus]
You took my hand and then we both started running
Both started running, there's no place to go
Another bullet and we both started running
Both started running too (Whoa-oh-ooh-whoa-oh)
Save yourself, don't ever look back (Whoa-oh)
Nowhere to go and so we both spin around in circles (Circles)
Whoa-oh-oh-ooh-whoa-oh
[Verse 2]
Creeping through these labyrinths
I find another dead end to the weekend, but is this real life?
Paper hearts turned ash begin to fly (Over our heads, I begin)
Screaming while the exit signs read "Heaven's waiting"
[Chorus]
You took my hand and then we both started running
Both started running, there's no place to go
Another bullet and we both started running
Both started running too (Whoa-oh-ooh-whoa-oh)
Save yourself, don't ever look back (Whoa-oh)
Nowhere to go and so and we both spin around in circles (Circles)
Whoa-oh-oh-ooh-whoa-oh
[Bridge]
And I said, "Hey, (Hey) what's on your mind?
I think about my life without you and I start to cry"
And I said, "Hey, (Hey) it's alright
We'll make it, I love you and I'll never leave your side"
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
[Chorus]
You took my hand and then we both started running
Both started running, there's no place to go
Another bullet and we both started running
Both started running too (Whoa-oh-ooh-whoa-oh)
Save yourself, don't ever look back (Whoa-oh)
Nowhere to go and so and we both spin around in circles (Circles)
Oh, let's go!
[Outro]
