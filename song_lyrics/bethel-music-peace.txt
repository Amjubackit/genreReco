[Verse 1]
When my mind is like a battlefield
And my heart is overcome by fear
And hope seems like a ship that's lost at sea
My enemies on every side
And I'm tempted to run and hide
Your gentle whisper reaches out to me
[Chorus]
Peace holds me when I'm broken
Sweet peace that passes understanding
When the whole wide world is crashing down, I fall to my knees
And breathe in Your peace
[Verse 2]
Fiery arrows whistling
The terror of the night sets in
But I can feel Your angels all around
I am resting underneath
The shelter of Your mighty wings
Your promises are where my hope is found, all my hope is—
[Chorus]
Peace holds me when I'm broken
Sweet peace that passes understanding
When the whole wide world is crashing down, I fall to my knees
And breathe in Your peace
[Bridge]
I remember who You are
You're the God who's never far
So I will not be afraid
God, You always keep me safe in Your arms
I remember who You are
You're the God who's never far
So I will not be afraid
God, You always, You always keep me safe
[Chorus]
You give me peace that holds me when I'm broken
Sweet peace that passes understanding
When the whole wide world is crashing down, I fall to my knees
And breathe in—
[Outro]
I breathe You, I breathe You in
Take a deep breath and be still and know that You are God alone
