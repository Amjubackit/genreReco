[Verse 1]
Starin' at two different views
On your window ledge
Coffee has gone cold
It's like time froze
[Pre-Chorus]
There you go wishin', floatin' down our wishin' well
It's like I'm always causin' problems, causin' hell
I didn't mean to put you through this, I can tell
We cannot sweep this under the carpet (Carpet)
[Chorus]
I hope that I can turn back the time
To make it all alright, all alright for us
I'll promise to build a new world
For us two with you in the middle
[Instrumental Drop]
[Post-Drop]
(You in the middle)
(You in the middle)
[Verse 2]
(Ly-, ly-, ly-, ly-)
Lyin' down beside you
What's goin' through your head?
The silence in the air
Felt like my soul froze
