[Verse 1]
I got a red room, it is the red hour
When the sun sets in my bedroom
I got a red room, it is the red hour
When the sun sets in my bedroom
Feels like I'm inside a flower
I got a red room, it is the red hour
When the sun sets in my bedroom
Feels like I'm inside a flower
Feels like I'm inside my eyelids
And I don't wanna be anywhere but here
I don't wanna be anywhere but here, mm
[Verse 2]
I got a red room, it is the red hour
When the sun sets in my bedroom
I got a red room, it is the red hour
When the sun sets in my bedroom
Feels like I'm inside a flower
Feels like I'm inside my eyelids
And I don't wanna be anywhere but here
I don't wanna be anywhere but here, mm
[Verse 3]
I got a red room, it is the red hour
When the sun sets in my bedroom
I got a red room, it is the red hour
When the sun sets in my bedroom
I got a red room, it is the red hour
When the sun sets in my bedroom
Feels like I'm inside a flower
Feels like I'm inside my eyelids
And I don't wanna be anywhere but here
I don't wanna be anywhere but here
