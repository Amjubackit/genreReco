[Intro]
Oh, woah
[Verse 1]
I need strength for the morning
Peace when it's time
You're all I need to get through this test
I give You all of the glory
Faith never dies
I ask You, will You see me?
[Chorus]
Am I too far gone?
Have I lost myself?
Will You see me, ooh?
Am I too far gone?
Have I lost myself?
Will You guide me, oh?
[Verse 2]
Waiting for a miracle to come
Holding onto faith when I know I've been dragged through the dirt
All these lies they told me
Will You help me see the truth?
[Bridge]
Oh, will You guide me where I'm at, yеah?
Oh, will You see me here?
Guidе me where I'm at
Watch over my steps (Oh)
Guide me where I'm at
Humble my steps (Ooh)[Chorus]
Am I too far gone?
Have I lost myself?
Will You see me, ooh?
Am I too far gone?
Have I lost myself?
Will You guide me, oh?
[Interlude: Spoken]
"Call to Me and I will answer you
And tell you great, unsearchable things
You do not know," says the Lord
God is faithful
Let us acknowledge the Lord
Let us press on to acknowledge Him
As surely as the sun rises, He will appear
He will come to us like the winter rains
Like the spring rains that water the earth
We know that all things God works for the good of those who love Him
Who have been called according to His purpose
He is the truth
He is the way
He is the life
And as long as we understand that principle
We will remain connected to the vine[Chorus]
Am I too far gone?
Have I lost myself?
Will You see me, ooh?
Am I too far gone?
Have I lost myself?
Will You guide me, oh?
