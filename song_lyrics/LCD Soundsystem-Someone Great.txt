[Verse 1]
I wish that we could talk about it
But there, that's the problem
With someone new, I couldn't start it
Too late for beginnings
The little things that made me nervous
Are gone in a moment
I miss the way we used to argue
Locked in your basement
[Verse 2]
I wake up and the phone is ringing
Surprised, as it's early
And that should be a perfect warning
That something's a problem
To tell the truth, I saw it coming
The way you were breathing
But nothing can prepare you for it
The voice on the other end
[Verse 3]
The worst is all the lovely weather
I'm stunned it's not raining
The coffee isn't even bitter
Because, what's the difference?
There's all the work that needs to be done
It's late for revision
There's all the time and all the planning
And songs to be finished
