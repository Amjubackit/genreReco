I almost let go
I felt like I couldn't take life anymore
My problems had me bound
Depression weighed me down
But God held me close
So I wouldn't let go
God's mercy kept me
So I wouldn't let go
I almost gave up
I was right at the edge of a breakthrough
But I couldn't see it
The devil really had me
But Jesus came and grab me
And He held me close, so I wouldn't let go
God's mercy kept me so I wouldn't let go
So I'm here today because God kept me
I'm alive today only because of His grace
Oh, He kept me, God kept me, He kept me
So I wouldn't let go
I almost let go
I felt like I couldn't take life anymore
My problems had me bound
Depression weighed me down
But God held me close
So I wouldn't let go
God's mercy kept me
So I wouldn't let go
So I'm here today because God kept me
I'm alive today only because of His grace
Oh, He kept me, God kept me
He kept me, God kept me
He kept me, God kept me, He kept me
God kept me, He kept me
So I wouldn't let go
He kept me, God kept me, He kept me
God kept me, He kept me
So I wouldn't let go
