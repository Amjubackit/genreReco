Tired of gettin' chased by the police and arrested
Niggas need a spot where we can kick it
Niggas ain't gotta get all dressed up and be Hollywood
Y'knahmean where do niggas go when we die?
Ain't no Heaven for a thug niggas, that's why we go to thug mansion
That's the only place where thugs get in free
And you gotta be a G at thug mansion
A place to spend my quiet nights, time to unwind
So much pressure in this life of mine, I cry at times
I once contemplated suicide, and would a tried
But when I held that 9, all I could see was my mommas eyes
No one knows my struggle, they only see the trouble
Not knowin' it's hard to carry on when no one loves you
Picture me inside the misery of poverty
No man alive has ever witnessed struggles I survived
Prayin' hard for better days, promise to hold on
Me and my dawgs ain't have a choice but to roll on
We found a family spot to kick it
Where we can drink liquor and no one bickers over trick shit
A spot where we can smoke in peace, and even though we G's
We still visualize places, that we can roll in peace
And in my mind's eye I see this place, the players go in fast
I got a spot for us all, so we can ball, at thug's mansion
Ain't no place I'd rather be, chillin' with homies and family
Sky high iced out paradise in the sky
Ain't no place I'd rather be, only place that's right for me
Chromed out mansion in paradise in the sky
Will I survive all the fights and the darkness?
Trouble sparks, they tell me home is where the heart is, dear departed
I shed tattooed tears and couldn't sleep good
For multiple years, witness peers catch gunshots
Nobody cares, seen the politicians ban us
They'd rather see us locked in chains, please explain
Why they can't stand us, is there a way for me to change?
Or am I just a victim of things I did to maintain?
