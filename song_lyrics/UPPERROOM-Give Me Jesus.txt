[Verse 1]
I don't want anything but You
You're more than every dream come true
All of the things I thought I wanted
Don't come close to knowing You
Now that I'm Yours and You are mine
Our love is the secret that I find
I'll spend forever in the pleasure
I've found looking in Your eyes
[Chorus]
Give me Jesus
Give me Jesus
You can have all this world
You can have all this world
[Verse 2]
More than silver, more than gold
You are the treasure that I hold
Now that I've tastеd of Your goodness
Nothing else will satisfy
[Chorus]
Just givе me Jesus
Give me Jesus
And you can have all this world
You can have all this world
Give me Jesus
Give me Jesus
And you can have all this world
You can have all this world
