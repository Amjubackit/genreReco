[Intro]
Oh, can I fall in love?
Oh, can I fall in love?
Oh, can I fall in love?
Oh, can I fall in love?
[Verse]
Oh, can I fall in love?
I wanna fall in love
Maybe I'll fall in love
Before this song is over
Oh, can I fall in love?
I wanna fall in love
Maybe I'II fall in love
Before this song is over
[Chorus]
Okay, alright
Lookin' for a certain type
To change my life
That knows the way to get me high
Don't break my vibe
Keep in on, just don't tell lies
Lose my mind, lose my mind, lose my mind
Lose my mind
