Come on!
[Verse 1]
Does she walk? Does she talk?
Does she come complete?
My homeroom homeroom angel
Always pulled me from my seat
She was pure like snowflakes
No one could ever stain
The memory of my angel
Could never cause me pain
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Years go by
I'm looking through a girly magazine
And there's my homeroom angel
On the pages in-between
[Chorus]
My blood runs cold
My memory has just been sold
My angel is the centerfold
Angel is the centerfold
My blood runs cold (Woo!)
My memory has just been sold
Angel is the centerfold[Verse 2]
Slipped me notes under the desk
While I was thinking about her dress
I was shy, I turned away
Before she caught my eye
I was shaking in my shoes
Whenever she flashed those baby-blues
Something had a hold on me
When angel passed close by
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Those soft and fuzzy sweaters
Too magical to touch
To see her in that négligée
Is really just too much
[Chorus]
My blood runs cold (Yeah)
My memory has just been sold
My angel is the centerfold
Angel is the centerfold
My blood runs cold
My memory has just been sold (Oh yeah)
Angel is the centerfold
[Bridge]
Na-na, na-na-na-na
Na-na-na, na-na-na-na
Na-na, na-na-na-na
Na-na-na, na-na-na-na
Na-na, na-na-na-na
Na-na-na, na-na-na-na
Na-na, na-na-na-na
Na-na-na, na-na-na-na[Verse 3]
Now, look
It's okay, I understand
This ain't no never-never land
I hope that when this issue's gone
I'll see you when your clothes are on
Take your car, yes, we will
We'll take your car and drive it
We'll take it to a motel room
And take 'em off in private
[Pre-Chorus 3]
A part of me has just been ripped
The pages from my mind are stripped
Oh no, I can't deny it
Oh yeah, 
I guess I gotta buy it
[Chorus]
My blood runs cold
My memory has just been sold
My angel is the centerfold
Angel is the centerfold
My blood runs cold (Woo!)
My memory has just been sold
My angel is the centerfold[Bridge/
