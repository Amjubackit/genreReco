[Verse 1]
Right in this moment I just feel so far from you (Mmm, ah)
Running out of options and I don't know what I'm gon' do
It's my own fault, Imma take the blame
Tried some new things, they just ain't the same
So I, I'm deciding to leave the door open, walk through (through)
[Pre-Chorus]
I've let this issue take too much of my time (take too much time away)
I've been stuck here in my own mind
Now I need to make a way for you to
[Chorus]
Come in (I need you to)
Come in (I need more of you)
Come in (Don't wanna be in here all alone)
Come in (Where you belong)
Come in (Know I was wrong)
Come in (Do what you gotta do to make it home)
Please get comfortable (comfortable)
I've created a place for you to (you to)
Come in (I'm asking you)
Come in (I'm begging you)
Come in (I need you to come in)
[Verse 2]
Ashamed to admit I thought I knew myself
But the truth is that I really need your help
There's freedom in you, so tell me what I gotta do
To get you here with me
Lord, I'll do anything
[Pre-Chorus]
I've let this issue take too much of my time (take too much time away)
(Oh) I've made space here
Take your space here
Here's an invitation for you to come in
[Chorus]
Come in (I need you to)
Come in (Need more of you)
Come in (Don't wanna be in here all alone)
Come in (Where you belong)
Come in (I know I was wrong)
Come in (Do what you gotta do to make this your home)
Please get comfortable (Please, Oh)
I've created a place for you to (To)
Come in
Come in (Come in)
Come in (We need you to)
[Bridge]
No need to clean out my closet
Cause you already know what's there
And you showed me that you really don't care
Starting today, you're always welcome
With my heart and soul
I'm available
[Outro]
Ah (Ah)
Ah (Ah)
