Grander earth has quaked before
Moved by the sound of His voice
And seas that are shaken and stirred
Can be calmed and broken for my regard
Through it all, through it all
My eyes are on You
Through it all, through it all
It is well
Through it all, through it all
My eyes are on You
And it is well with me
Far be it from me to not believe
Even when my eyes can't see
And this mountain that's in front of me
Oh, will be thrown into the midst of the sea
And through it all, through it all
My eyes are on You
Through it all, through it all
It is well
Through it all, through it all
My eyes are on You
And it is well, it is wellLet go, my soul, and trust in Him
The waves and wind still know His name
So let go, my soul, and trust in Him
The waves and wind still know His name
So let go, my soul, and trust in Him
The waves and wind still know His name
The waves and wind still know His name
It is well with my soul
It is well with my soul
It is well with my soul
It is well, it is well with my soul
It is well with my soul (It is well, it is well, it is well)
It is well with my soul (It is well, it is well, it is well)
It is well with my soul (It is well, it is well, it is well)
It is well, it is well with my soul
It is well, it is well with my soul
'Cause through it all, through it all
My eyes are on You
Through it all, through it all
It is well
Through it all, through it all
My eyes are on You
It is well, it is well, it is well
With me
