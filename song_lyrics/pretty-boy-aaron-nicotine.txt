[Intro: Bruhnice]
He's like-
He's like don't-
He's like don't let it mess up again
[Chorus x2: Pretty Boy Aaron & Sabz]
I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just
Just get enough
I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just
Just can't give you up
Don't tell me I'm addicted
And I hate when I lie and I hate you cry in my face [Just get enough]
Don't tell me I'm addicted
And I worry about my problems, but you know that I'll never
But you know that I'll never be a
[Verse: Pretty Boy Aaron]
Puffing on your smoke, addict to your habit
Caught up in your life and I'm ready for the baggage
Talking to my friends and the way they looking at it
I don't stand a chance, but they happy that I batted
Haven't been thе same, but I'm coming right back
Take a drag and it's pulling me back

That I don't {That I don't]
That I don't {That I don't}
But I
Know that you're wrong bringing me along and I
Know that I'm wrong keeping you in palm's reach
Keep you on beat, see I've gone deep
And the homies saying, "Haven't seen you all week"

You only hit me on my line when you need me to rap
And now you keep me in traps, but you're feeding me fat
And I know

I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just
Just get enough
I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just
Just can't give you up
Don't tell me I'm addicted
And I hate when I lie and I hate you cry in my face [Just get enough]
Don't tell me I'm addicted
And I worry about my problems, but you know that I'll never
But you know that I'll never be a
