[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
[Chorus]
Let me catch ya vibe, let's just take our time
Just relax your mind and take it easy
Don’t have to decide, you do, I do, I
Don't have to be mine, let's take it easy
[Verse 1]
Damn, we so fi’, bae
Whippin' through the 305 highway
Love it how you ride in the fast lane
Make me wanna say, "That's my babe," yeah
Dani gotta behave, gotta be chill like a Sunday
Never wanna look too thirsty
But your drip got me feeling wavy
[Pre-Chorus]
Make you feel lucky, lucky
Make you wanna love me, love me
Baby, when you with me, with me
Got no worries, worries
I love it when you touch me, touch me
Feelin' so lovely, lovely
Make me wanna love me, love me
Make me feel lucky, lucky
[Chorus]
Let me catch ya vibe, let's just take our time
Just relax your mind and take it easy
Don't have to decide, you do, I do, I
Don't have to be mine, let's take it easy
[Bridge]
Hey, yeah
Let’s take it easy
Hey
[Verse 2]
Never gotta OD
I just wanna love you like a homie
Make you feel love like that OG
It could feel just like the old days
Okay, let’s just be real
I can tell you like how this feels
Ain't no stress, no mistakes
Put in that work, you gon’ miss me
[Pre-Chorus]
Make you feel lucky, lucky
Make you wanna love me, love me
Baby, when you with me, with me
Got no worries, worries
I love it when you touch me, touch me
Feelin' so lovely, lovely
Make me wanna love me, love me
Make me feel lucky, lucky
[Chorus]
Let me catch ya vibe, let's just take our time
Just relax your mind and take it easy
Don't have to decide, you do, I do, I
Don’t have to be mine, let's take it easy
