And it fills me up
And starts to shine
And I see it burn when you bring me sunlight
Is it all you need
To feel this heat
To feel like everything is all that you dreamed
Is it all too much
Did you get enough
Does it set on fire all the things that you touch
Fills me up
And it starts to shine
And I see it burn when you bring me sunlight
And it fills me up
And it starts to shine
And I see it burn when you bring me sunlight
Is it all you need
To feel this heat
To feel like everything is all that you dreamed
Is it all too much
Did you get enough
Does it set on fire all the things that you touch
And it fills me up
And it starts to shine
And I see it burn when you bring me sunlight
And it's all you need
To feel this heat
To feel like everything is all that you dreamed
Is it all too much
Did you get enough
Does it set on fire all the things that you touch
And it fills me up
When it starts to shine
And I see it burn when you bring me sunlight
And it fills me up
And it starts to shine
And I see it burn when you bring me sunlight
Is it all you need
To feel this heat
To feel like everything is all that you dreamed
Is it all too much
Did you get enough
Does it set on fire all the things that you touch
And it fills me up
And it starts to shine
And I see it burn when you bring me sunlight
And it fills me up
And it starts to shine
And I see it burn when you bring me sunlight
Is it all you need
To feel this heat
To feel like everything is all that you dreamed
Is it all too much
Did you get enough
Does it set on fire all the things that you touch
And it fills me up
And it starts to shine
And I see it burn when you bring me sunlight
