[Verse 1]
I wake up every evenin'
With a big smile on my face
And it never feels outta place
And you're still probably workin'
At a 9 to 5 pace
I wonder how bad that tastes
[Chorus]
When you see my face, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell
[Verse 2]
Now where's your picket fence, love?
And where's that shiny car?
And did it ever get you far?
You never seemed so tense, love
I've never seen you fall so hard
Yeah, do you know where you are?
[Pre-Chorus]
And truth be told, I miss you
And truth be told, I'm lyin'
[Chorus]
When you see my face, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell
If you find a man that's worth a damn and treats you well
Then he's a fool, you're just as well, hope it gives you hell
I hope it gives you hell
