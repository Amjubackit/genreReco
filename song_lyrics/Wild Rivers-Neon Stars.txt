I met you on the rooftop
Shining with the moonlight
Honey you had me
Said when’s the band gonna start?
You got me in a bad way
Caught me on my last legs
Honey you held me
And pulled me out of the dark
Now I’m right back where you left me baby
Drinking in that uptown bar
Know I sound like such a drag here baby
But oh we used to laugh so hard about it
We were only kids back then
Lying on some broke down car
Thinking out loud, dreaming under neon stars
You were sleeping I was tracing
Every part of you a constellation
I knew you
But I was terrified
Sweet until the last drop
Straight across the black top
Lighting the night up
And burning out in the sky
