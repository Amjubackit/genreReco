[Verse 1]
Mm, mm, yeah, yeah, yeah
You never knew
You would fail
You never knew
You'd go through the things you've been through
You never knew
That you would fall
But I heard his voice say
I heard his voice say
[Chorus]
Years of pain
It is not your portion
Failure
It is not your portion
Sickness
It is not your portion
Poverty
It is not your portion
(I have to embrace the promise) Ooh, ooh, oh, oh
[Verse 2]
You never knew
You'd be broken
You never knew
You'd cry the tears that you've cried
You never knew
You'd lose the things you've lost
But I heard his voice say
I have good news, I have good news
[Chorus]

All throughout the day, good news
Even when I lay my head down at night
I declare good news
(Good news)
And I'm so glad the promise doesn't wear off
Every day, I believe God
That's my portion
(That's your portion)
