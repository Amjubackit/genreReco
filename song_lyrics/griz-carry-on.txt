"Hey, I know we haven't talked in a while but I just wanna say, you're doing amazing and I hope your not getting too caught up on all the things you think you should be doing. I know you've been told you gotta do this, gotta do that, gotta do it this way but you're on your own path, so let it come to you. As you pass through time don't forget to simply enjoy existing here, in this moment. Cuz that's all we got, is time right now. So take care of yourself. I love you and I'll talk to you later. Alright, Peace. "
