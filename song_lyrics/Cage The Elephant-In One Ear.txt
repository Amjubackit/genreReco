[Verse 1]
They say that we ain't got the style, we ain't got the class
We ain't got the tunes that's gonna put us on the map
And I'm a phony in disguise, tryna make the radio
I'm an antisocial anarchist who sound like so-and-so
They say I'm just a stupid kid, another crazy radical
Rock 'n' roll is dead, I probably should have stayed at school
Another Generation X who somehow slipped up through the cracks
Oh, they'd love to see me fall, but I'm already on my back
[Chorus]
So it goes in one ear and right out the other
People talking shit, but you know I never bother
It goes in one ear and right out the other
People talking shit, they can kiss the back of my hand
[Verse 2]
Now I know I'm not a saint, I've been a sinner all my life
I ain't tryin' to hide my flaws, I'd rather keep them in the light
They want to criticize, scrutinize, cast another stone
Burn me at the stake
 
and sit and watch it from their throne
They say the devil is my pal,
 
I do a lot of drugs
The crowd will only like me if they're really fucking drunk
They think they know my thoughts, but they don't know the least
If they'd listen to the words they'd find a message tucked beneath
