[Verse 1: UMI]
I know you're hurting, you're hurting inside
Know when you feel it, you feel it at night
Why won't you let me in?
Why won't you let me understand you?
Why won't you let me in?
Baby, just take my hand and
[Chorus: UMI]
Can you let me sing you a lullaby?
And maybe then you'd let me in tonight
[Verse 2: Yeek]
I've been cooking up a playlist
'Cause I don't know how I could say this
If love was a subject in school
Couldn't major in communication
Feelings (I don't want 'em)
They won't show
But when it's time to sleep
You get emotional
[Chorus: UMI]
Can you let me sing you a lullaby?
And maybe then you'd let me in tonight
