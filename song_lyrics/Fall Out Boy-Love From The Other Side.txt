[Verse 1]
Model house life meltdown still a modern dream letdown, it kills me
You know I'm dying out here
What would you trade the pain for?
I'm not sure
We were a hammer to the Statue of David
We were a painting you could never frame, and
You were the sunshine of my lifetime
What would you trade the pain for?
[Pre-Chorus]
This city always hangs a little bit lonely on me, loose
Like a kid playing pretend in his father's suit
I'd never go, I just want to be invited, oh, got to give up
Get the feeling, get the feeling, don't fight it, fight it
[Chorus]
Sending my love from the other side of the apocalypse
And I just about snapped, don't look back
Every lover's got a little dagger in their hand
Love from the other side of the apocalypse
And I just about snapped, don't look back
Every lover's got a little dagger in their hand
[Verse 2]
Generation sleep, I'm falling in and out of love
I'm getting that tilted feeling out here
What would you trade the pain for?
I'm not sure
Nowhere left for us to go but Heaven
Summer falling through our fingers again
And you were the sunshine of my lifetime
What would you trade the pain for?
