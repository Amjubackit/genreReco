[Verse 1]
There's no holding back to my surrender
I give You all for You gave it all for me
Your nail-pierced hands held my redemption
Now with hands held high, I give You everything
[Chorus]
My heart adores You, Jesus
My life, my love, poured out at Your feet
My heart adores You, Jesus
More than anything, more than anything
[Verse 2]
Whatever the cost, I'll bring the offering
For in letting go I find all I'll ever need
So here I am Lord, have Your way in me
My life laid down, I give You everything
[Chorus]
My heart adores You, Jesus
My life, my love, poured out at Your feet
My heart adores You, Jesus
More than anything, more than anything
My heart adores You, Jesus
My life, my love, poured out at Your feet
My heart adores You, Jesus
More than anything, more than anything[Post-Chorus]
We adore You
Oh, we adore You, yes, we do
Come on, declare this tonight
[Bridge]
I am Yours, completely Yours
Completely abandoned for You, Lord
(Let's sing!)
I am Yours, completely Yours
Completely abandoned for You, Lord
Oh, I am Yours, completely Yours
Completely abandoned for You, Lord
Oh, I am Yours, completely Yours
Completely abandoned for You, Lord
[Chorus]
My heart adores You, Jesus
My life, my love, poured out at Your feet
My heart adores You, Jesus
More than anything, more than anything
[Bridge]
(I am Yours), completely Yours
Completely abandoned for You, Lord
Oh, I am Yours, completely Yours
Completely abandoned (Come on, declare it)
For You, Lord[Outro]
I am Yours, completely Yours
Completely abandoned for You, Lord
I am Yours, completely Yours
Completely abandoned for You, Lord
(Jesus, we have)
