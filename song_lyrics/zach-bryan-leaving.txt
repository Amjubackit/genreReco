[Verse 1]
It takes a hell of a heart to know what a heart really needs
And I'm finding out that love ain't what love's cut out to be
If I was not my momma's boy, I'd leave you cryin' in this car
Punch a hole in your damn dashboard and forget the girl you are
[Verse 2]
We've been fighting for so long it'd be a shame to let this go
But I'd rather let it lie than hurt a sweet girl I know
And it's getting dark now so won't you just stay
And I'll tell you that I love you 'til the leaving goes away
[Chorus]
'Til the leaving leaves this house no we ain''t going out
'Til I make some promises that I can't keep
And I wish I could explain how the toxins in my brain
Get me so damn down sometimes I can't speak
And you'll try to understand why I can't be a better man
But it's hard when I'm yelling at you in the street
So if leaving comes to staying and you walk yourself away
Leave knowing that no one could love you more than me
[Bridge]
And I hope the world don't mind all the simple things I ask
Like a porch with good lighting and to hear my lady laugh
And I'll act indifferent because I don't wanna leave
'Cause leaving's for a younger man that I don't wanna be[Chorus]
'Til the leaving leaves this house no we ain''t going out
'Til I make some promises that I can't keep
And I wish I could explain how the toxins in my brain
Get me so damn down sometimes I can't speak
And you'll try to understand why I can't be a better man
But it's hard when I'm yelling at you in the street
So if leaving comes to staying and you walk yourself away
Leave knowing that no one could love you more than me
