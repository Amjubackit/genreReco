[Verse 1]
Always going somewhere
Yeah, I'm living fast
Ninety miles an hour
No brakes, all gas
If I die tomorrow
Don't be dressed in black
Need a couple favors
Instead of feeling sad
Tell my mom I loved her
Yeah, my daddy too
And to all my lovers
My words were true
[Chorus]
Hey, everybody on the floor
Two step and say no more
Oh, everybody in the back
Jump up and clap your hands
Celebrate what we had
Celebrate what we had
[Verse 2]
I want pyrotechnics
Hell, a big parade
Dressed up, and going nowhere
Dancin' around my grave
No surprise I'm leaving
We all gotta go
Might make it to one hundred
By then I'm ready for sure
Tell my kids I loved 'em
And my grandkids too
All my great grandchildren
Love what you do[Chorus]
Hey, everybody on the floor
Two step and say no more
Oh, everybody in the back
Jump up and clap your hands
Celebrate what we had
Celebrate what we had
[Bridge]
Oh, if there's a heaven, baby
Then I know I'll see you there
But if this all we got, that's okay too
Our love was real
Our love was real
[Chorus]
Hey, everybody on the floor
Two step and say no more
Oh, everybody in the back
Jump up and clap your hands
Hey, everybody on the floor
Two step and say no more
Oh, everybody in the back
Jump up and clap your hands
Celebrate what we had
Celebrate what we had (Celebrate what we had)
Celebrate what we had
Always going somewhere
Celebrate what we had
Yeah, I'm living fast
Celebrate what we had
Ninety miles an hour
No brakes, all gas
