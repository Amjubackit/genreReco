[Intro: James Murphy, 
Nancy Whang
, and 
Both
]
Climbing the down escalator
To the 
frigid
 
bardo
 
(Up, up, up, up, up, up)
Rise 
(Up, up, up, up, up, up)
Kidnap yourself 
(Up!)
Don't call the fuzz
Just counting the bills
You've got 
fives, tens, twenties, fifties
Hundreds, hundreds, hundreds, hundreds
[Verse 1]
Yeah, I need a new body, I need a new body
I need a bit of shape and a tone
Ooh, ooh
Yeah, I need a new body, I need a new body
I can't shake sleeping alone
You see, I have been misplaced
I have been mislaid
Like a covetous dog that you can't just leave in your home
Yeah, I need a new lover, I need a new body
I can't stay out too long
Like my hands have gone numb
[Chorus 1: James Murphy & 
Nancy Whang
]
(
Pana, sonic, pana, sonic, pana, sonic, pana, sonic
)
Just give us what we want
(
Pana, sonic, pana, sonic, pana, sonic, pana, sonic
)
