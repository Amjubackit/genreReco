[Verse 1]
I remember times, my love, when we really had it all
You were always there to make me smile, help me when I fall
Ooh, I can't believe you're leaving me
When there's so much more to say
[Pre-Chorus]
I can't let you go
Ooh, every time I look at you, I still can feel the glow
Let it be, let it grow
[Chorus]
Ooh, love me please, just a little bit longer
Together, we can make it
Our love is much too young to break it
Love me please, just a little bit harder
[Verse 2]
All I ever wanted was to have you to myself
Then I see you standing there in the arms of someone else
You know a man can stand so much
And it's more than I can bear
[Pre-Chorus]
I can't let you go
Ooh, every time I look at you, I still can feel the glow
Let it be, let it grow
