[Verse 1]
You're like waking in the morning by a mountain stream
You're like watching that eagle floating on the breeze
As I listen to you dreaming by my side
I wish I could call you mine
[Chorus]
But you belong where the four winds blow
Out where the untamed mustang roam
Like a sweet summer rain, passing through
Never seen anything wild as you
[Verse 2]
I could stay with you like this
'Til the day love don't exist
Wildflowers bloom in an open field
And wither in a vase on a window sill
[Chorus]
And you belong where the four winds blow
Out where the untamed mustang roam
Like a sweet summer rain passing through
Never seen anything wild as you
[Bridge]
There's a part of me that prays
That you'll hang up your wings someday
But the part that truly does love you
Always hopes you never do[Chorus]
'Cause you belong where your heart can be
Out in the open, wild, and free
Like a sweet summer rain, passing through
I ain't never seen anything wild as you
[Chorus]
You belong where the four winds blow
Out where the untamed mustang roam
Like a sweet summer rain, passing through
Never seen anything wild as you
[Chorus]
You belong where the four winds blow
Out where the untamed mustang roam
Like a sweet summer rain, passing through
Never seen anything wild as you
