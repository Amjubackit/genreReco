[Verse 1]
Can we forget about the things I said when I was drunk?
I didn't mean to call you that
I can't remember what was said or what you threw at me
Please tell me
[Chorus]
Please tell me why
My car is in the front yard, and I'm
Sleeping with my clothes on
I came in through the window last night
And you're gone, gone
[Verse 2]
It's no surprise to me, I am my own worst enemy
'Cause every now and then, I kick the living shit out of me
The smoke alarm is going off, and there's a cigarette
Still burning
[Chorus]
Please tell me why
My car is in the front yard, and I'm
Sleeping with my clothes on
Came in through the window last night
And you're gone, gone[Instrumental Bridge]
[Chorus]
Please tell me why
My car is in the front yard, and I'm
Sleeping with my clothes on
I came in through the window last night
[Outro]
(Ah-ooh) It's no surprise to me, I am my own worst enemy
(Ah-ooh) 'Cause every now and then, I kick the living shit out of me
(Ah-ooh) Can we forget about the things I said when I was drunk?
(Ah-ooh) I didn't mean to call you that
(Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
