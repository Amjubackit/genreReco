[Verse 1]
Outside for the first time in a long time
Lose yourself, sink into the sunlight
It's been a while since you felt right
But the warm nights are coming soon
And you'll be just fine
You'll be just fine
You'll be just fine
[Pre-Chorus]
Outside for the first time in a long time
You said you can't remember what it's like
To feel more than cold on the inside
But the sunrise will come again
And you'll be just fine
You'll be just fine
[Chorus]
I think it's time you had a pink cloud summer
'Cause you've gone too long without a smile
I think it's time you found another reason to stay for a while
You should stay for a while
[Verse 2]
I sit and watch, now with new eyes
For the green side
Lose myself, sink into your sunlight
Breath in the breeze like a sweet sigh
Keep me tongue-tied
If this lasts forever, I'll be just fine
Oh, I'll be just fine
