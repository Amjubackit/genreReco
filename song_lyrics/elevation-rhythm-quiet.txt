[Verse 1]
Here we go again, my mind racing
And I can't seem to win
All these crazy thoughts and feelings
It's like it never ends
Until Your voice, breaks through my noise
I know I'm not alone, not alone
[Pre-Chorus]
You will fight my battles if I will just be still
Why would I keep running when You're right here?
[Chorus]
I'll just be quiet
And let You speak through the silence
Here I am, no more hiding
You are in this moment, I won't fight it
I'll be quiet
[Verse 2]
I don't need to know what comes next
Tomorrow's in Your hands
I can trust You with my future
'Cause You're already there
I hear Your voice call me forward
And I know I'm not alone, not alone
[Pre-Chorus]
Away with the distractions, I wanna hear what's true
The only words that matter, they come from You
[Chorus]
I'll just be quiet
And let You speak through the silence
Here I am, no more hiding
You are in this moment, I won't fight it
I'll be quiet
I'll just be quiet
And let You speak through the silence
Here I am, no more hiding
You are in this moment, I won't fight it
I'll be quiet
[Interlude]
Ah-ah-ah-ah, oh-oh-oh-oh
Ah-ah-ah-ah, oh-oh-oh-oh
Ah-ah-ah-ah, oh-oh-oh-oh
Ah-ah-ah-ah, oh-oh-oh-oh
[Chorus]
Quiet
God, You're here in the silence
Here I am, no more hiding
You are in this moment, I won't fight it
I'll be quiet
