[Verse 1: PinkPantheress]
Take a look inside your heart
Is there any room for me (Is there any room for me?)
I won't have to hold my breath
Till you get down on one knee (Till you get down on one knee)
Because you only want to hold me
When I'm looking good enough (When I'm looking good enough)
Did you ever feel me?
Would you ever picture us? (Would you ever picture us?)
[Verse 2: PinkPantheress]
Every time I pull my hair
Well, it's only out of fear (Only out of fear)
That you'll find me ugly
And one day you'll disappear because
What's the point of crying?
It was nеver even lovе (It was never even love)
Did you ever want me?
Was I ever good enough? (Ever good enough?)
[Chorus: PinkPantheress]
The-the boy's a liar, the boy's a liar
He doesn't see ya, you're not looking at me, boy
The boy's a liar, the boy's a liar
He doesn't see ya, you're not looking at me, boy
