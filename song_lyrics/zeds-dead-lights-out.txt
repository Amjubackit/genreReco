(Verse 1)
You know the night is young
I'm tryna have some fun
And you're the only one
(One, one, one, one)
We're gonna leave this city
We'll drive and drive for miles
No time to think about it
Let's run away, let's run
Ohh...
(Instrumental chorus)
(Verse 2)
This city has my heart
But now we're miles apart
We'll make a brand new start
Start, start, start now
Let's find a new beginning
No time to turn, act now
This road is never ending
We'll find new ways to now
Ohh...
(Bridge)
Lights out
Lights out
Lights out
Lights out
(Intrumental chorus)
Lights out
Lights out
Ohh...
Ohh...
Lights out
Ohh...
Ohh...
(Instrumental chorus)
(Verse 3)
Oh, you gonna see the lights
And they're burning bright
Those city lights
And they're burning bright
Oh, the city lights
And they're burning bright
Those city lights
And they're burning bright
Oh, the city lights
Oh, the city lights x4
The city lights x4
Lights out x4
