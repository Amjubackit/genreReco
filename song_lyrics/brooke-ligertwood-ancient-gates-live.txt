[Verse 1]
There is singing at the ancient gates
There's a melody of ceaseless praise
Age to age, the sound is only growing stronger
There's a throne beneath the name of names
There is seated on it One who reigns
And His kingdom now is here and getting closer
[Chorus]
So praise Him like we're in the glory
Here and now, He's just as holy
Jesus, He's so worthy of it all
[Verse 2]
He exists in everlasting light
So on Heaven's streets there is no night
Every tear is wiped away, we'll know no sorrow
Yeah, worship Him with joyful sound
Oh, sing until your voice gives out
No matter where or who's around release your worship
Mm-mm-mm
[Chorus]
Praise Him like we're there in glory
Here and now, He's just as holy
Jesus, He's so worthy of it all
Bring your song, He loves to hear it
Bring Him every prayer-soaked lyric
Jesus, He's so worthy of it all[Bridge]
The One who was, the One who is
The One who is to come
The One who was, the One who is
The One who is to come
(The One)
The One who was, the One who is
The One who is to come
The One who was, the One who is
The One who is to come
[Chorus]
Praise Him like we're there in glory
Here and now, He's just as holy
Jesus, He's so worthy of it all
Bring your song, He loves to hear it
Bring Him every prayer-soaked lyric
Jesus, He's so worthy of it all (Worthy, worthy of it all)
[Outro]
The One who was, the One who is
The One who is to come
The One who was, the One who is
The One who is to come
The One who was, the One who is
The One who is to come
The One who was, the One who is
The One who is to come
