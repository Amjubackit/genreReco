[Verse 1]
You can dance every dance with the guy
Who gives you the eye, let him hold you tight
You can smile every smile for the man
Who held your hand neath the pale moon light
[Chorus]
But don't forget who's takin' you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So darlin' save the last dance for me
[Verse 2]
Oh I know that the music's fine
Like sparklin' wine, go and have your fun
Laugh and sing, but while we're apart
Don't give your heart to anyone
[Chorus]
And don't forget who's takin' you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So darlin' save the last dance for me
[Verse 3]
Baby don't you know I love you so
Can't you feel it when we touch
I will never never let you go
I love you oh so much[Verse 4]
You can dance, go and carry on
Till the night is gone
And it's time to go
If he asks if you're all alone
Can he walk you home, you must tell him no
[Chorus]
Cause don't forget who's taking you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
Save the last dance for me
[Verse 5]
Oh I know that the music's fine
Like sparklin' wine, go and have your fun
Laugh and sing,but while we're apart
Don't give your heart to anyone
[Chorus]
And don't forget who's takin' you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So darlin' save the last dance for me
So don't forget who's taking you home
Or in whose arms you're gonna be
So darling, save the last dance for me
Ooooh
Baby won't you save the last dance for me
You make the promise that you save the last dance for me
Save the last dance
The very last dance
For me!
