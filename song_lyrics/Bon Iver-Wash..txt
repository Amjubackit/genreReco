[Verse 1]
Climb
Is all we know
When thaw
Is not below us
No, can't grow up
In that iron ground
Claire,
 
all too sore for sound
[Verse 2]
Bet
Is hardly shown
Scraped
Across the foam
Like they stole it
And, oh, how they hold it
Claire,
 we nearly forfeit
[Chorus 1]
I... I'm growing like the quickening hues
I... I'm telling darkness from lines on you
Over havens fora
Full and swollen morass, young habitat
All been living alone
Where the ice snap and the hold clast are known
