[Intro: Lady Gaga & 
Akon
]
Truth!
RedOne
Konvict
Gaga (
Oh-oh, eh
)
[Verse 1: Lady Gaga & 
Akon
]
I've had a little bit too much, much 
(Oh, oh, oh-oh)
All of the people start to rush (Start to rush by)
A dizzy twister dance
, 
can't find my drink or man
Where are my keys? I lost my phone, phone 
(Oh, oh, oh-oh)
[Pre-Chorus: Lady Gaga]
What's goin' on, on the floor?
I love this record, baby, but I can't see straight anymore
Keep it cool, what's the name of this club?
I can't remember, but it's alright, a-alright
[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
Just dance
Gonna be okay, da-da-doo-doot-n
Just dance
Spin that record, babe, da-da-doo-doot-n
Just dance
Gonna be okay
Da-da-da-dance, dance, dance
Just, j-j-just dance
