There's Autumn rains down by the river
Singing sweet songs that wash my pain away
There's Autumn rains up on the mountain
I don't seek shelter 'cause I've always loved the rain
There's Autumn rains down by the river
Singing sweet songs that wash my pain away
There's Autumn rains up on the mountain
I don't seek shelter 'cause I've always loved the rain
She said nobody's ever written a song about me
'Cause they don't see the beauty in the rains that I see
Amber ale, sweet bud and sunshine
Like to listen to the river flow cross my mind
There's Autumn rains down by the river
Singing sweet songs that wash my pain away
There's Autumn rains up on the mountain
I don't seek shelter 'cause I've always loved the rain
I ain't seen you 'round in a month or two you've been hiding
I can't fight these feelings for you I'm fighting
I'm the first to sing this song to
You, but the only man that's going to
All the places that you'll see, you won't stop to think of me
And I'll listen to the river flow cross my mind
And I'll listen to the river flow while it kills my time
