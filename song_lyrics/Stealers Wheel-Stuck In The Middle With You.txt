[Verse 1]
Well, I don't know why I came here tonight
I got the feeling that something ain't right
I'm so scared in case I fall off my chair
And I'm wondering how I'll get down the stairs
[Chorus]
Clowns to the left of me
Jokers to the right
Here I am
Stuck in the middle with you
[Verse 2]
Yes, I'm stuck in the middle with you
And I'm wondering what it is I should do
It's so hard to keep this smile from my face
Losing control, yeah, I'm all over the place
[Chorus]
Clowns to the left of me
Jokers to the right
Here I am
Stuck in the middle with you
[Post-Chorus]
Well, you started out with nothing
And you're proud that you're a self-made man
And your friends, they all come crawling
Slap you on the back and say
Please
Please
