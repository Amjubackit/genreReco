[Verse 1]
You're dressing like a Sunday morning
And your eyes look like
Little islands in the light
Hazel and light green
On white sheets
You're grinning like a Friday night
And you're smiling like
You know what you like
I think I do know you well
I know you well
[Chorus 1]
We come alive in the evening
With heat and wet skin
Ay, our bodies are tossed and turned
Tangled up in it
I come alive when you tease me
With heat and wet skin
Flesh and bone turned (ooh)
Flesh and bone turned
The weight of you close to me
[Verse 2]
You hold me like a prized possession
(Hold me, hold me, hold me, ah) That's close
Our bodies unfurl like smoke
We twist and we curl like smokeFever out (Out)
We're burning now
Holler out
We holler out 'til hollowed out
[Chorus 2]
Oh, we come alive in the evening
With heat and wet skin
Ay, our bodies are tossed
And turned, tangled up in it
I come alive when you tease me
With heat and wet skin
Flesh and bone turned (ooh)
So much flesh and bone turned
The weight of you in the evening
Your wet skin
Ay, our bodies are tossed
And turned, tangled up in it
[Outro]
I come alive when you tease me
With heat and wet skin
Your body close
And your body close
The weight of you
