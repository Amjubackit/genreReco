[Chorus]
I, I packed this bowl for two
And I, I'm gonna wanna smoke it with you
I said oh I, I packed this bowl for two
And I, I'm gonna wanna smoke it with you
[Verse 1]
Yes, you know it is time for us to sit down and unwind
I know the feeling, I know the feeling so stay with me tonight
Gonna kick back relax make sure the ganja's packed and we'll feel all right
[Pre-Chorus]
We're flying high now, we're flying high now
I cannot feel the ground
We're flying high now, we're flying high now
My world is spinning round
[Chorus]
I, I packed this bowl for two
And I, I'm gonna wanna smoke it with you
I said oh I, I packed this bowl for two
And I, I'm gonna wanna smoke it with you
[Verse 2]
So please don't run, run away when my ganja's all gone
A promise that, that you're gon gonna stay when my fight is all done
There's only one thing left to do
I got this one nug this frosty purple nug and it's big enough for a two
[Chorus]
I, I packed this bowl for two
And I, I'm gonna wanna smoke it with you
I said oh I, I packed this bowl for two
And I, I'm gonna wanna smoke it with you
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Pre-Chorus]
We're flying high now, we're flying high now
I cannot feel the ground
We're flying high now, we're flying high now
My world is spinning round
[Chorus]
I, I packed this bowl for two
And I, I'm gonna wanna smoke it with you
I said oh I, I packed this bowl for two
And I, I'm gonna wanna smoke it with you
