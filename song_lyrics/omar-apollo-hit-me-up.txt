[Chorus: Omar Apollo]
Uh, said I've got some time I'm abusin'
Change my mind if you ever switch it up (Yeah)
And I'll waste my time if you pursue me (You pursue me)
I'll let you know if you ever hit me up (Hit me up)
[Verse 1: Omar Apollo]
Pretty boy, pretty boy, not a city guy
I ain't in the mix, I don't wanna feel
Fill you up, fill you up, put your head down
By my headphones, I don't get it, but
Pullin' up, pullin' up in my car
All my friends comin' down
Say you won't, say you won't
Ride with me, yeah (Yeah)
[Chorus: Omar Apollo]
Said I've got some time I'm abusin' (Did it, girl, I don't wanna get it)
Change my mind if you ever switch it up (Switch it up)
And I'll waste my time if you pursue me (If you pursue me)
I'll let you know if you ever hit me up (Yeah)
[Verse 2: Dominic Fike]
You know I wouldn't tell you where to go (You know I wouldn't)
Nobody listens to the radio, baby
We're bendin' corners like we're runnin' from the sun up
Whip is turnin' different colors and you're takin' on changes
Wish I could see you come around and fill you up
Waited for you, baby, but you stood me up (You stood me up)
Breakin', what you gave me wasn't good enough
What you gave me wasn't good enough
Wish I could see you come around like one more time
Faded, like numb it down, over quick just like summertime
Baby, let's double down, I bet you would fuck with me now
I bet, I bet, I bet you would fuck with me now (Yeah)
[Chorus: Omar Apollo]
Said I've got some time I'm abusin' (Did it, girl, I don't wanna get it)
Change my mind if you ever switch it up (Switch it up, pretty girl, pretty girl)
And I'll waste my time if you pursue me (If you pursue me)
I'll let you know if you ever hit me up
[Outro: Omar Apollo]
Glad you did it, girl, I don't wanna get it done (Get it done)
Switch it up (Pretty girl, pretty girl)
Yeah
