[Verse 1: Tim Armstrong]
Yeah, If you wanna make a move then you better come in
It's just the ability to reason that wears so thin
Livin' and dyin' and 
the stories that are true
Secrets to a good life's knowin' when you're through
[Chorus]
Black coat, white shoes, black hat, Cadillac
Yeah, 
the boy's a time bomb
Black coat, white shoes, black hat, Cadillac
Yeah, 
the boy's a time bomb
[Verse 2: Tim Armstrong]
Well, he's back in the hole where they got him livin' like a rat
But he's smarter than that, nine lives like a cat
Fifteen years old, take him to the youth authority home
First thing you learn, you gotta make it in this world alone
[Chorus]
Black coat, white shoes, black hat, Cadillac
Yeah, 
the boy's a time bomb
Black coat, white shoes, black hat, Cadillac
Yeah, 
the boy's a time bomb
[Verse 3: Tim Armstrong]
Now he's gotten out, he gotten free, he got a coat, got a car
He's twenty-one years old, he's 
runnin' numbers from the bar
His pager's beepin', he's gettin' deep in
Whatever he can move on in, you know that kid's a creepin'[Chorus]
Black coat, white shoes, black hat, Cadillac
Yeah, 
the boy's a time bomb
Black coat, white shoes, black hat, Cadillac
The boy's a time bomb
Yeah, the boy's a time bomb
[Interlude: Tim Armstrong]
Yeah
[Verse 4: Tim Armstrong]
Tears come from the razor that's been tattooed below his eye
His mother cries
, she knows that he is strong enough to die
He's rollin' in the Cadillac, it's midnight, sunroof is down
Three shots rung out the hero's dead, the new king is crowned
[Chorus]
Black coat, white shoes, black hat, Cadillac
Yeah, 
the boy's a time bomb
Black coat, white shoes, black hat, Cadillac
Yeah, 
the boy's a time bomb
Black coat, white shoes, black hat, Cadillac
Yeah, 
the boy's a time bomb
Black coat, white shoes, black hat, Cadillac
Yeah, 
the boy's a time bomb[Outro]
Oh, time bomb
