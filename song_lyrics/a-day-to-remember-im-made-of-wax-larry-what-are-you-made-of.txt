[Chorus: Jeremy McKinnon]
Don't blink, they won't even miss you at all
And don't think that I'll always be gone
You know, I've got you like a puppet in the palm of my hand
Don't you let me down!
[Verse 1: Jeremy McKinnon]
So, run like hell
Sleep with one eye open, I can't forgive or forget you
We'll tell everyone the damage done
Deep down, you can't stop me, you can't stop me now!
[Pre-Chorus: Jeremy McKinnon]
I'll be there just to watch you fall
So, don't push me, I've got nothing to lose
[Chorus: Jeremy McKinnon]
Don't blink, they won't even miss you at all
And don't think that I'll always be gone
You know, I've got you like a puppet in the palm of my hand
Don't you let me down!
[Verse 2: Jeremy McKinnon]
Here I go again
I made it so damn hard to come back from the mess that you're in
I need you to know, I told you so
You're a snake and I'm cautious, just use your head!
[Pre-Chorus: Jeremy McKinnon]
I'll be there just to watch you fall
So, don't push me, I've got nothing to lose
[Chorus: Jeremy McKinnon]
Don't blink, they won't even miss you at all
And don't think that I'll always be gone
You know, I've got you like a puppet in the palm of my hand
Don't you let me down!
Don't blink, they won't even miss you at all
And don't think that I'll always be gone
You know, I've got you like a puppet in the palm of my hand
Don't you let me down!
[Interlude: Jeremy McKinnon]
Come on, oh!
Ahem...
[Bridge: Mike Hranica & Jeremy McKinnon]
Everybody's out to get me! Any moment could be my last!
This is me! You can take it or leave! Right or wrong!
I will stand on my own two feet! Just breathe!
Just breathe! Just breathe!
[Chorus: Jeremy McKinnon]
Don't blink, they won't even miss you at all
And don't think that I'll always be gone
You know, I've got you like a puppet in the palm of my hand
Don't you let me down!
Don't blink, they won't even miss you at all
And don't think that I'll always be gone
You know, I've got you like a puppet in the palm of my hand
Don't you let me down!
Oh!
