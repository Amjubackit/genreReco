[Verse 1: Zach Williams, 
Zach Williams & Dolly Parton
]
Every time I tried to make it on my own
Every  time I tried to stand and start to fall
And  all those lonely roads that I have travelled on
There was Jesus
[Verse 2: 
Zach Williams
, Zach Williams & Dolly Parton]
When the life I built came crashing to the ground
When  the friends I had were nowhere to be found
I  couldn't see it then but I can see it now
There was Jesus
[Chorus: Zach Williams & Dolly Parton, 
Zach Williams
]
In  the waiting, in the searching
In the healing and the hurting
Like a blessing buried in the broken pieces
Every minute‚ every moment
Where  I've been and where I'm going
Even when I didn't know it or couldn't see it
There was Jesus
[Verse 3: Zach Williams, 
Zach Williams & Dolly Parton
]
For this man who needs amazing kind of grace (Mmm)
For forgiveness at a price I couldn't pay (Mmm)
I'm not perfect so I thank God every day
There was Jesus (There was Jesus)[Chorus: Zach Williams & Dolly Parton, 
Zach Williams
]
In the waiting‚ in the searching
In the healing and the hurting
Like a blessing buried in the broken pieces
Every minute‚ every moment
Where I've been and where I'm going
Even when I didn't know it or couldn't see it
There was Jesus
[Bridge: Zach Williams & Dolly Parton]
On the mountain, in the valleys (There was Jesus)
In the shadows of the alleys (There was Jesus)
In the fire, in the flood (There was Jesus)
Always is and always was
No‚ I never walk alone (Never walk alone)
You are always there
[Chorus: Zach Williams & Dolly Parton, 
Zach Williams
, 
Dolly Parton
]
In the waiting, in the searching
In the healing and the hurting
Like a blessing buried in the broken pieces
Every minute (Every minute), every moment (Every moment)
Where I've been and where I'm going
Even when I didn't know it or couldn't see it
There was Jesus
There was Jesus
There was Jesus
There was Jesus
