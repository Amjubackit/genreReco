[Verse 1]
It all started in the summer
And you hit me like a breeze
Now we've made it to the winter
And I'm hoping we don't freeze
Oh, I wanna tell you something
With all the words that I can give
I'm in love with everything about you
And that's just the way it is
[Pre-Chorus]
And I hope you know
Even when it doesn't show, mm
[Chorus]
I'll run through fire for you
Whatever I gotta do
Give you my heart while it beats
'Cause with you's where I wanna be
[Interlude]
Do, do-do, do, do-do, do
Do, do-do, do, do-do, do
Do, do-do, do, do-do, do
Do, do-do, do, do-do, do[Verse 2]
Oh, you're something like a raindrop
When you're falling on the trees
Makе your way down to the soil
And those roots, they do run deep
Oh, you'rе something like a sunrise
Pretty to my mind
Soothing to my soul
Watching the world spin one more time
[Pre-Chorus]
And I hope you know
Even when it doesn't show, mm
[Chorus]
I'll run through fire for you
Whatever I gotta do
Give you my heart while it beats
'Cause with you's where I wanna be
