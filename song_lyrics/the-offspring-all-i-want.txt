[Intro]
Okay! Ya ya ya ya ya!
[Verse 1]
Day after day (Your home life's a wreck)
The powers that be just breathe down your neck
You get no respect (You get no relief)
You gotta speak up and yell out your piece
[Pre-Chorus]
So back off your rules, back off the jive
'Cause I'm sick of not living to stay alive
Leave me alone, askin' a lot
I don't wanna be controlled
[Chorus]
That's all I want
That's all I want
That's all I want
That's all I want
Ya-ya-ya-ya-ya!
[Verse 2]
How many times (Is it gonna take)
'Til someone around you hears what you say?
You've tried bein' cool (You feel like a lie)
You've played by their rules, now it's their turn to try
[Pre-Chorus]
So back off your rules, back off your jive
'Cause I'm sick of not living to stay alive
Leave me alone, not asking a lot
Just don't want to be controlled
[Chorus]
That's all I want
That's all I want
That's all I want
That's all I want
[Bridge]
I said it before, I'll say it again
If you could just listen, then it might make sense
[Pre-Chorus]
So back off your rules, back off your jive
'Cause I'm sick of not living to stay alive
Leave me alone, not asking a lot
Just don't want to be controlled
[Chorus]
That's all I want
That's all I want
That's all I want
[Outro]
Ya-ya-ya-ya-ya!
