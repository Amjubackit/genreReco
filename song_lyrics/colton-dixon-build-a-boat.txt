[Verse 1]
I've been wanderin' through the desert
Ain't seen a cloud in forever over me
But I believe Your rain is comin', mm
I've been hangin' on to high hopes
'Cause You're the one who's makin' dry bones come to life
You're the light I put my trust in
[Pre-Chorus]
Every word You say is gonna come true
You will lead me to the promised land
Everything You say is gonna happen
Even though I haven't seen it yet
[Chorus]
I will build a boat in the sand where they say it never rains
I will stand up in faith, I'll do anything it takes
With Your wind in my sails, Your love never fails or fades
I'll build a boat in the desert place
And when the flood and the water starts to rise, yeah
I'll ride the storm 'cause I got You by my side
With Your wind in my sails, Your love never fails or fades
I'll build a boat, so let it rain
[Verse 2]
You're the map, You're my compass
You help me navigate the currents underneath
Take the lead, I surrender, oh[Pre-Chorus]
Every word You say is gonna come true
You will lead me to the promised land
Everything You say is gonna happen
Even though I haven't seen it yet
[Chorus]
I will build a boat in the sand where they say it never rains
I will stand up in faith, I'll do anything it takes
With Your wind in my sails, Your love never fails or fades
I'll build a boat in the desert place
And when the flood and the water starts to rise, yeah
I'll ride the storm 'cause I got You by my side
With Your wind in my sails, Your love never fails or fades
I'll build a boat, so let it rain
[Post-Chorus]
I'll build a boat, so let it rain
[Chorus]
I will build a boat in the sand where they say it never rains
I will stand up in faith, I'll do anything it takes
With Your wind in my sails, Your love never fails or fades
I'll build a boat in the desert place
And when the flood and the water starts to rise, yeah
I'll ride the storm 'cause I got You by my side
With Your wind in my sails, Your love never fails or fades
I'll build a boat, so let it rain
