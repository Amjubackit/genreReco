[Intro (Hezekiah)]:
God, we stand tonight
Amazed at Your power
Amazed at Your strength
Amazed at Your glory
So tonight we offer this song to You
Just to let You know how we really feel about You
Come on Ashley
Help me sing this song tonight
[Chorus]
It's so amazing
Your love for me
It's so amazing
Your sacrifice for me
For every blessing
Given to me
For every valley
You used to strengthen me
[Pre-Chorus]
I don't deserve Your love
Your tender mercy
If not for Your grace where would I be
[Chorus]
It's so amazing
Your love for me
It's so amazing
Your sacrifice for me
For every blessing
Given to me
For every valley
You used to strengthen me
[Pre-Chorus]
I don't deserve Your love
Your tender mercy
If not for Your grace where would I be
