[Verse 1: Eric Vanlerberghe]
I said, "Go away"
Take a moment, think it over, I said, "Not today"
'Cause everybody sucks, and I cannot relate
And everything is fucked, and I cannot be saved
Maybe that's because I'm on the way
Took everything I had and threw it in the flames
Watch it burn while they're steady taking aim
I guess it came with repercussions
I've been in it for a minute, this is not up for discussion
[Chorus: Eric Vanlerberghe]
Tell me that you hate me, and I'll tell you that I fuckin' love it
Tell me you'll save me, and I'll tell you that you're savin' nothin'
Tell me bout your demons, and I'll tell you that I've got a dozen
I'll take 'em with me on my path to self-destruction
[Post-Chorus: Brian Burkheiser, 
Eric Vanlerberghe
]
We go 24/7 'til we're six feet deep
Head in the clouds but our heart's concrete
Burn the whole thing down while they got cold feet
Yeah, they can try to copy but they can't compete
(If you don't know the Devil) 
Then, you don't know me
Yeah, you don't know the Devil, then you don't know me
[Verse 2: Brian Burkheiser, 
both
]
All the preconceived premonitions
From people who never listen
Creating all the division
Yeah, how can you live with yourself?
I'm the definition of coming to a collision
The old and the new edition
The hero becomes a villain
