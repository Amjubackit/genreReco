[Verse 1]
Say you want a little wild in your Friday
Kinda sick of this same old scene
This neon leaves you lonely, baby, I know what you mean
You're tired of wastin' your time, them other boys, they always trippin'
Well, I know a guy who might just know what you've been missin'
[Chorus]
Say you've been lookin' around
All over this little town
Starin' out the bar room door
Can't find what you're lookin' for
You've been locked down for a while
You want some 
more wild and free
I don't know who you're waitin' on but
Kinda sounds like me to me
Kinda sounds like me to me
[Verse 2]
Well you kinda sorta seem like a little Jim Beam
In your bottle wouldn't hurt so bad
And you need a little more black smoke
Down an old back road than what you had
Yeah, and I might be wrong
But a boy like me might be your type
And my country song
Goes hand in hand with your angel eyes, yeah
