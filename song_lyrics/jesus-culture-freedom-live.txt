[Instrumental]
[Verse 1]
Step out of the shadows, step out of the grave
Break into the wild and don't be afraid
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Run into wide open spaces, grace is waiting for you
Dance like the weight has been lifted, grace is waiting
[Chorus]
Where the Spirit of the Lord is
There is freedom, there is freedom
Where the Spirit of the Lord is
There is freedom, there is freedom
Come out of the dark just as you are
Into the fullness of His love
For the Spirit is here, let there be freedom
Let there be freedom
[Verse 2]
Bring all of your burdens, bring all of your scars
Come back to communion, come back to the start
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Run into wide open spaces, grace is waiting for you
Dance like the weight has been lifted, grace is waiting[Chorus]
Where the Spirit of the Lord is
There is freedom, there is freedom
Where the Spirit of the Lord is
There is freedom, there is freedom
Come out of the dark just as you are
Into the fullness of His love
For the Spirit is here, let there be freedom
Let there be freedom
[Interlude]
[Bridge]
Chains will fall, prisons shake
At the sound of Jesus' name
Lives made whole, hearts awake
At the sound of Jesus' name
Chains will fall, prisons shake
At the sound of Jesus' name
Lives made whole, hearts awake
At the sound of Jesus' name!
[Turn]
[Chorus]
Where the Spirit of the Lord is
There is freedom, there is freedom
Where the Spirit of the Lord is
There is freedom, there is freedom
Come out of the dark just as you are
Into the fullness of His love
For the Spirit is here, let there be freedom
Let there be freedom
Let there be freedom[Pre-Chorus 2]
Dance like the weight has been lifted, grace is waiting 
for you
Dance like the weight has been lifted
Dance like the weight has been lifted, grace is waiting for you
Dance like the weight has been lifted, grace is waiting
Dance like the weight has been lifted, 'cause He did it, yes, He did it
Oh, dance like the weight has been lifted, grace is waiting!
[Chorus]
Where the Spirit of the Lord is
There is freedom, there is freedom
Where the Spirit of the Lord is
There is freedom, there is freedom
Come out of the dark just as you are
Into the fullness of His love
For the Spirit is here, let there be freedom
Let there be freedom
Let there be freedom
Let there be freedom!
