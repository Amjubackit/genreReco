[Verse 1]
When you're so high you don't think
When you fall from the sky you won't break
[Refrain]
So come down from the clouds
Come down now
So come down from the cloud
Come down now
[Chorus]
Mmm, mmm, mmm
I've been loving you, too long, mmm
I've been loving you for too long
[Refrain]
So come down from the clouds
Come down now
So come down from the cloud
Come down now
[Verse 2]
When you're so high you don't think
When you fall from the sky you won't break
[Chorus]
I've been loving you, too long, mmm
I've been loving you for too long
