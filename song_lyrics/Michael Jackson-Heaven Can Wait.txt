[Chorus]
Tell the angels no, I don't wanna leave my baby alone
I don't want nobody else to hold you
That's a chance I'll take
Baby, I'll stay, Heaven can wait
No, if the angels took me from this earth
I would tell them bring me back to her
It's a chance I'll take, maybe I'll stay
Heaven can wait
[Verse 1]
You're beautiful, you're wonderful
Incredible, I love you so
You're beautiful
Each moment spent with you is simply wonderful
This love I have for you girl it's incredible
And I don't know what I'd do, if I can't be with you
The world could not go on so every night I pray
If the Lord should come for me before I wake
I wouldn't wanna go if I can't see your face, can't hold you close
What good would Heaven be
If the angels came for me I'd tell them no
[Chorus]
Tell the angels no, I don't wanna leave my baby alone
I don't want nobody else to hold you
That's a chance I'll take
Baby, I'll stay, Heaven can wait
No, if the angels took me from this earth
I would tell them bring me back to her
It's a chance I'll take, maybe I'll stay
Heaven can wait
