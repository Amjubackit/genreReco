[Verse 1]
Help me please
Help me be the one
Show me please
How I can be the one
[Chorus]
'Cause I understand
That I hold you back
But I'm just a man
A bad one at that
So I'll hold it down
And I'll give you up
'Cause I understand
That you're not in love
[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, I'm going to be alright
I see the light
So I'm going to be alright
(I see the light)
Yeah, I'm going to be alright
[Verse 2]
Help me feel
Help me feel alright
Bury me
Bury me alive
