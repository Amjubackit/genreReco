[Verse 1]
Sometimes it feels like I don't belong here
Roots can't take hold 'cause I didn't fit
Can't see the way out through all my tears
I know they always say to hold on for better days
I didn't think that I could make it
Came close to givin' up every day
The fact I'm here is kind of amazing
Funny how destiny brought out the best of me
[Pre-Chorus]
So darling, why don't we get high on love and let it in?
Feel the flood of everything
Oh, of everything tonight
Surrender 'til it's all too much
I'm givin' in to the rush
No, I've never been
Oh, I've never been so alive
[Chorus]
Alive, so alive
Oh I've never been so alive
Alive, so alive
Oh, I've never been
[Drop]
Oh, I've never been so alive
So alive
Oh, I've never been so alive
So alive[Verse 2]
Feels like I'm breathin' in for the first time
Wide open eyes, I'm seein' it all
For the first time in years, I know I'll be alright
Look how far I've made it now
Now that I made it out
I don't wanna waste any more heartbeats
I wanna see what I haven't yet, oh
The whole damn world is waitin' there for me
And nothing can hold me back
And maybe I'm fine with that
[Bridge]
I wanna live, I wanna be right now
I wanna scream 'til my lungs give out
Oh, this is what it means to be alive
And I wish that time would just slow down
I can't get enough of life right now
Oh, this is what it means to be alive, oh
I wanna live, I wanna be right now
I wanna scream 'til my lungs give out
Oh, this is what it means to be alive
And I wish that time would just slow down
I can't get enough of life right now
Oh, this is what it means to be alive[Drop]
Oh, I never felt so alive
It's what it means to be alive, oh
[Outro]
I wanna live, I wanna be right now
I wanna scream 'til my lungs give out
Oh, this is what it means to be alive
And I wish that time would just slow down
I can't get enough of life right now
Oh, this is what it means to be alive
What it means to be alive
