[Intro]
Yeah
[Verse 1]
GOP, SOS
Putting crystals on your necklace
Think they'll save your life (Everybody got a problem 'til there ain't one)
Common greed, ghosts in sheets
Haunting everybody's calling
Dimming out all of their lights (Oh)
[Chorus]
All my, all my plants are dead
All my, all my hope is gone
Sleeping in through every season
I'll be passed out on the lawn
Either critically acclaimed
Or too mentally deranged
Give me something to believe in
Before all this fades away (Hey, hey)
[Post-Chorus]
You needed a hit (Hey, hey)
Well, listen to this (Hey, hey)
Well, listen to this[Verse 2]
Yeah, I'm sickened in the head, but they made me
Overheard on my left from a model
Wanna patch up my soul from the potholes
Gonna kidnap a genie in a bottle
And who says patience is a virtue?
You don't fight here, it'll curse you
Even now, can't sleep with the antics
Clich√©s, footsteps in the attic
[Chorus]
All my, all my plants are dead
All my, all my hope is gone
Sleeping in through every season
I'll be passed out on the lawn
Either critically acclaimed
Or too mentally deranged
Give me something to believe in
Before all this fades away (Hey, hey)
[Post-Chorus]
You needed a hit (Hey, hey)
Well, listen to this (Hey, hey)
Well, listen to this
