[Intro]
If there was a single day I could live
A single breath I could take
I'd trade all the others away
[Verse 1]
The blood's on the wall, so you might as well just admit it
And bleach out the stains, commit to forgetting it
You're better off empty and blank, than left with a single pathetic trace of this
[Refrain]
Smother another failure, lay this to rest
[Chorus]
Console yourself, you're better alone
Destroy yourself, see who gives a fuck
Absorb yourself, you're better alone
Destroy yourself!
[Verse 2]
I'll chain you to the truth, for the truth shall set you free
I'll turn the screws of vengeance and bury you with honesty
I'll make all your dreams come to life and slay them as quickly as they came
[Refrain]
Smother another failure, lay this to rest[Chorus]
Console yourself, you're better alone
Destroy yourself, see who gives a fuck
Absorb yourself, you're better alone
Destroy yourself!
[Breakdown]
See who gives a fuck
See who gives a fuck
See who gives a fuck
Failure!
[Outro]
If there was a day I could live
If there was a single breath I could take
I'd trade all the others away
I'd trade all the others away!
