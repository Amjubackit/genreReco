[Verse 1]
It ain't alright, the hardness of my head
Now close your eyes and spin around
Say, hard times, you could find
That it ain't the way that you want
But it's still alright
Late at night, do you lay around wondering?
Counting all the lines, it ain't so funny now
Say, times are hard, you get this far
But it ain't the way that you want
[Verse 2]
I'll be damned if this old man
Don't start to counting his losses
But it's still alright
[Verse 3]
They say you learn a lot out there
How to scorch and burn
Gonna have to bury your friends
And then you'll find it gets worse
Standing out on the ledge
With no way to get down
Start praying for wings to grow
Oh, baby, just let go
[Verse 4]
I ain't alright, you keep spinning out ahead
It was cold outside when I hit the ground
Say, I could sleep here, forget all the fear
It will take time to grow
Maybe, I don't know
Hey, tonight, if you think about it again
Remembering all the times that you pointed out
Say, the glass is clear, but all this fear
Starts a-leaving a mark
Your idle hands are all that stands
From your time in the dark
But it's still alright
