[Verse 1]
My girl is a nightbird, she put in all that night work
Mornings, you can't find her, but night go down, she flies
My girl is a night bird, she puts in all that night work
Friends don't call her nice words, but she pay them no mind
My girl is a nightbird, she put in all that night work
Mornings, you can't find her, but night go down, she flies
My girl is a night bird, she puts in all that night work
Friends don't call her nice words, but she pay them no mind
