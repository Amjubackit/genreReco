[George Carlin]
Cocked, locked and ready-to-rock
You can’t shut me up
Rough, tough and hard to bluff
You can’t dumb me down
I’ve got no need for coke and speed
You can’t shut me up
I've got no urge to binge and purge
You can’t dumb me down
I interface with my database
My database is in cyberspace
I wear power ties
I tell power lies
I take power naps
And run victory laps
I read junk mail
I eat junk food
I buy junk bonds
And I watch trash sports
I’m tireless
And I’m wireless
I’m an alpha male on beta-blockersI’m interactive
I’m hyperactive
And from time to time I’m radioactive
I take it slow
I go with the flow
I ride with the tide
I’ve got glide in my stride
I don’t snooze
So I don’t lose
I keep the pedal to the metal
And the rubber on the road
I've been pre-wash, pre-cooked, pre-heated, pre-screened, pre-approved, pre-packaged, post-dated, freeze-dried
And
I’m hangin in, there ain’t no doubt and I’m hangin tough, over and out!
