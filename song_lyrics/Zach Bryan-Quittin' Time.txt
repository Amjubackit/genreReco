[Verse 1]
This labor I've been doing ain't got no reason or rhyme
And I can't hardly wait for it to finally be quittin' time
And I've been pushing steel through a run down Rust Belt plant
And I can't wait to head on home, so I can take my gal to dance
How I'll take my gal to dance
Oh, I'll take my gal to dance
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 2]
The desert sure is hot and we've been working through the days
I pray I get back to my loving lady's gaze
Rifle in my hand and some brothers to my side
I can't hardly wait for it to finally be quittin' time
Oh, I pray it'll be quittin' time
Oh, one day it'll be quittin' time
[Chorus]
Quittin' time's on my mind
But her kind eyes are on my heart
I've been swеatin' for my wages
But she'll cool me aftеr dark
How she'll cool me after dark
I know she'll cool me after dark
