[Verse 1]
I was just a puppet on a string
I gave you everything
Wish I'd knew your love was untrue
That would have saved some soul searching
[Chorus]
Now I'm nobody's clown, nobody's clown
Now I'm nobody's clown, nobody's clown
[Verse 2]
I'm sorry if I treated you badly
I only wanted to love you madly
If you came back I'd take you back gladly
But that's not going to happen sadly
[Chorus]
Now I'm nobody's clown, nobody's clown
Now I'm nobody's clown, nobody's clown, well, well
[Bridge]
This ain't my first rodeo
But it's my first time being the clown
You swore you'd never go
But then you left and haven't been back around
Ooh, ooh-ooh
I was a clown, baby girl
I was just a puppet on your string
Until you cut me down[Verse 3]
They say a man is supposed to be
Strong enough to stand up on his two
But they don't understand
How it feels to think you found the one and be number two, yeah
[Chorus]
Now I'm nobody's clown, nobody's clown
Now I'm nobody's clown, nobody's clown
[Outro]
Now I'm nobody's clown, nobody's clown, well, well, well
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody wants a clown
Somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody please take this clown
