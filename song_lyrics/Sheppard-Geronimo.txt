[Verse 1]
Can you feel it? Now it's coming back
We can steal it if we bridge this gap
I can see you through the curtains of the waterfall
When I lost it, yeah, you held my hand
But I tossed it, didn't understand
You were waiting as I dove into the waterfall
[Chorus]
So say Geronimo, say Geronimo
Say Geronimo, say Geronimo
Say Geronimo, say Geronimo
Say Geronimo
[Post-Chorus]
Can you feel my love?
Bombs away, bombs away
Bombs away
Can you feel my love?
Bombs away, bombs away
Bombs away
Say Geronimo
[Verse 2]
Well, we rushed it, moving way too fast
That we crushed it, but it's in the past
We can make this leap through the curtains of the waterfall
