[Chorus]
Runnin' through this strange life
Chasin' all them green lights
Throwin' out the shade for a little bit of sunshine
Hit me with them good vibes
Pictures on my phone like
Everything is so fine
A little bit of sunshine
[Verse 1]
Crazy lately I'm confirmin'
Tryna write myself a sermon
You just tryna get a word in, life is not fair
I been workin' on my tunnel vision
Tryna get a new prescription
Takin' swings and even missin' but I don't care
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm dancin' more just a little bit
Breathin' more just a little bit
Care a little less just a little bit
Like life is woo-hoo!
I'm makin' more just a littlе bit
Spend a little more to gеt rid of it
Smile a little more and I'm into it
