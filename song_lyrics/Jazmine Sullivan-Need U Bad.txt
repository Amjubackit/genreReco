[Intro]
Oh!
Ayy baby, weh you ah deal with?
Hey
We come through a lot of things, you know?
So what happened to you?
Me make one little mistake you want done us?
New Jazmine, let's go!
[Verse 1]
If I had you back in my world
I would prove that I could be a better girl
(Oh, oh, oh)
If you let me back in
I would sure enough never, never let you go again
Hey baby
[Pre-Chorus]
(Ooh, ooh-ooh)
I was so foolish to ever leave your side
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Searching for what was right before my eyes
(Ooh, ooh-ooh)
It was me who didn't realize till it was gone
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
But now I know I need you in my life
