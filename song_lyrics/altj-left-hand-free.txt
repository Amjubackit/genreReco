[Verse 1]
Ain't shady, baby
I'm hot
 
like the prodigal son
Pick a petal: eeny, meeny, miny, moe
And flower, you're the chosen one
[Chorus]
Well, your left hand's free
And your right's in grip
With another left hand
Watch his right hand slip
Towards his gun
Oh, no
[Verse 2]
I tackle, we tussle
And oh my days, we're rolling
My right hand's gripped on his
Colt single-action army
Oh, no
[Chorus]
Well, your left hand's free
And your right's in grip
With another left hand
Watch his right hand slip
Towards his gun
Oh, no
