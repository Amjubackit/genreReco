Big 4L, I'm a member (Yeah)
Leave an opp cold, like December (What?)

AK knockin' down trees, like timber
Get your baby mama 'fore we bend her (21)
Hit the windshield, not the fender (21)
Givin' out smoke my agenda (21)
Throw the white flag, they surrender (Pussy)
All black tux, I'm a businessman (Pussy)
Millionaire, still shakin' killеrs hand (Woah)
Take the plug off and the middlе man (Woah)
Spray the whole block, I don't give a damn (Woah)
Fuck a nigga bitch, I'm a gentleman (21)

Playin' with the rock like I'm Jigga man
Gotta look a nigga in the eyes when you kill a man
