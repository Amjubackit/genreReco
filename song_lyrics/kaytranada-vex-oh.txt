[Intro: Ari PenSmith]
(Vex, oh)
(My baby, don’t vex, oh)
(My baby, don’t vex, oh, ah)
(No vex, oh)
(No vex, oh)
(My baby, don’t vex, oh, ah)
[Verse 1: Eight9FLY]
Me no lie, me no lie
Got lost in her eyes
Found something I like, yeah
Weren't even my type
Me no lie, me no lie
We had drinks all night
Put my phone on silent
And I don't know why
No, I couldn't leave her
Shoulda said, "Bye, Felicia"
Must have been the tequila
I wish you had amnesia
Come, come, what I did can't be undone
Kiss and chase, baby, run, run
Don't give my love to no one (No one)
[Pre-Chorus: Ari PenSmith]
Bad belle wey she get (Wey she get)
You go try, try, shey you no forget? (Forget)
No, no forgiveness, oh, ah, ah
To the left, to the left (To the left)
Wanna take a real lie reset (Ah)
She said na domino effect, oh, ah, ah[Chorus: Ari PenSmith]
And I say no vex, oh (No vex, oh)
No vex, oh, ah
My baby, don't vex, oh (No vex, oh)
My baby, don't vex, oh, ah
And I say no vex, oh
No vex, oh, ah
My baby, don't vex, oh (No vex, oh)
Don't vex, oh, ah
[Verse 2: GoldLink]
I just wanna get behind you on the dance floor
Then I take her back to that, back to the dance club
Handsome, always call me handsome, then I hand grab
Throw tantrum if you leave me, that's it
Lord, no lie, when I ride on a beat
I just try to supply when the beat good
Think you don't even care about your man though
Rap good, but I think I'm an asshole
Fuck me good then I fuck so long
That the moon and the sun switch position, a sinkhole
And I roll it over, I call it a pick roll
I'm on top, I don't mind if we switch roles
Next morning when we leave, you can switch clothes
Pissed off, you ain't get my number when I hit though
Real nice with the words but I'm mean with that nice stroke
And I kinda bite though, alright, ho?[Pre-Chorus: Ari PenSmith]
Bad belle wey she get (Get, get)
You go try, try, shey you not forget? (Don't forget, oh, ah)
No, no forgiveness, oh, ah, ah
To the left, to the left (To the left)
Wanna take a real lie reset (Oh)
She said na domino effect, oh, ah, ah
[Chorus: Ari PenSmith]
And I say no vex, oh (No vex, oh)
No vex, oh, ah
My baby, don't vex, oh (No vex, oh)
My baby, don't vex, oh, ah
And I say no vex, oh (No vex, oh)
No vex, oh, ah
My baby, don't vex, oh (No vex, oh)
Don't vex, oh, ah
