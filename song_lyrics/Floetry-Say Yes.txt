[Intro]
Uh, just tell him
See I been watching you for a while
Your smile and stuff
But I don't know if I can, be with you for the night, alright?
Is that all right, baby? Baby
[Verse 1]
There is only one for me
You have made that possibility
We can take that step to see, hmm
If this is really gonna be
All you gotta do is say yes
[Hook]
All you gotta do is say yes
Don't deny what you feel
Let me undress you baby, open up your mind, just rest
I'm about to let you know, you make me so
All you gotta do is say yes
Don't deny what you feel
Let me undress you baby, open up your mind, just rest
I'm about to let you know
You make me so so, so so so so so so
You make me so so, so so so so so so, ahh
