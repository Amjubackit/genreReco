[Verse 1: Gerard Way]
Mama, we all go to Hell
Mama, we all go to Hell
I'm writing this letter and wishing you well
Mama, we all go to Hell
Oh well, now, Mama, we're all gonna die
Mama, we're all gonna die
Stop asking me questions, I'd hate to see you cry
Mama, we're all gonna die
[Chorus: Gerard Way]
And when we go, don't blame us, yeah
We'll let the fires just bathe us, yeah
You made us oh so famous
We'll never let you go
And when you go, don't return to me, my love
[Verse 2: Gerard Way]
Mama, we're all full of lies
Mama, we're meant for the flies
And right now, they're building a coffin your size
Mama, we're all full of lies
[Pre-Chorus: Gerard Way]
Well, mother, what the war did to my legs and to my tongue
You should've raised a baby girl, I should've been a better son
If you could coddle the infection, they can amputate at once
You should've been, I could have been a better son
