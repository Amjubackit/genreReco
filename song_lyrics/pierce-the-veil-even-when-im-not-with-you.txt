[Verse 1]
I could run all night
I would never tire or slow, I
I could hold you tight
Tighter than a sold-out show, I
[Pre-Chorus]
I believe in the slow ride, so I
Drag your heart through the sand and snow, I
Couldn't live by the old school rule, I
Binge-watched every episode, I
[Chorus]
Oh, I've been wrong
Heart under the gun
Look how far we've come
Think I've finally won
[Verse 2]
Red lipped Snow White
Sipping beer through a straw real slow, I
Had a perfect high
Lip-locked in a bathroom stall, I
[Pre-Chorus]
I believe in the slow ride, so I
Drag your heart through the sand and snow, I
Inhalе the future slow, I
Exhale thе past, let go, I
[Chorus]
Oh, I've been wrong
Heart under the gun
Look how far we've come
Think I've finally won
[Bridge]
Even when I'm not with you
I'm still with you
Even when I can't see you
I still feel you
Even when I can't touch you
I pretend to
Even when I'm not with you
I'm still with you
Even when I think I hate you
I still love you
Even when I can't kiss you
I still wait to
Even when I'm not with you
I'm still with you
Even when I'm not with you
I'm still with you (With you)
[Chorus]
Oh, I've been wrong
Heart under the gun
Look how far we've come
Think I've finally won
Oh, I've been wrong
Heart under the gun
Look how far we've come
Think I've finally won
[Outro]
It's good to know that I'm
The only one who can cut you further
What is love besides
Two souls trying to heal each other?
