I'm lonesome but happy, rich but I'm broke
And the good lord knows the reason, I'm just a cowpoke
From Cheyenne to Douglas, the ranges I know
So I drift with the wind, no one cares where I go
I ain't got a dime in these old worn-out jeans
So I'll stop eatin' steak and I'll go back to beans
I'll pick up a ten spot in Prescott, I know
Ridin' the broncs in the big 
rodeo
Some evenin' in springtime, 
a filly I'll find
I might spend all summer with her on my mind
I'll never be branded and never be broke
I'm a carefree range-ridin' driftin' cowpoke
