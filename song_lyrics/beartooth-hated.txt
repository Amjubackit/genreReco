[Intro]
Who knew you'd be hated for being who you are
And be a big target for all the insecure?
[Verse 1]
All alone in a wall-less prison
Didn't forget and youâ€™re not forgiven
Live every day with the pain in the back of my mind
Torture doesn't begin to describe it
[Pre-Chorus]
I won't forget
I won't forgive
I won't forget
[Chorus]
Who knew you'd be hated for being who you are
And be a big target for all the insecure?
There's a bullseye painted on our chests
In the crosshairs of the ignorant
But I am not your scapegoat anymore
[Verse 2]
All alone with my own decisions
I try to scream but you never will listen
It took a while but you're finally out of my life
And I swear there's no better feeling
[Pre-Chorus]
I won't forget
I won't forgive
I won't forget
[Chorus]
Who knew you'd be hated for being who you are
And be a big target for all the insecure?
There's a bullseye painted on our chests
In the crosshairs of the ignorant
But I am not your scapegoat anymore
[Bridge]
Try to scream but you never will listen
Didn't forget and you're not forgiven
You're not forgiven
Didn't forget and you're not forgiven
No!
[Chorus]
Who knew you'd be hated for being who you are
And be a big target for all the insecure?
Who knew you'd be hated for being who you are
And be a big target for all the insecure?
There's a bullseye painted on our chests
In the crosshairs of the ignorant
But I am not your scapegoat anymore
