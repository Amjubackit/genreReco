[Verse 1]
I raised you in the dark
Caught you reading by the sunrise
You wandered from the path
Through the silence of the hillside
[Pre-Chorus 1]
And don't you know
I could see it in you even then?
And don't you know
I was trying to hold back the darkness?
[Chorus]
And are you really okay?
Are you really okay?
[Verse 2]
You woke me up one night
Dripping crimson on the carpet
I saw it in your eyes
Cutting deeper than the scars could run
[Pre-Chorus 2]
And don't you know
I can see it in you even now?
And don't you know?
I want to help you but I don't know how
