[Verse 1]
Rumor around town
You've been getting down
With some ole boy at the bar
Heard he looks like me
Bet your daddy's so proud
He won't get you very far
You ain't nothin' like your momma, girl
You're so full of drama
And I got you on your knees
Beggin', baby, come back
I didn't mean that
Sayin' that you miss me (Miss me)
[Verse 2]
Been on the road for ten months now
Tuesday of next week
The nerve you had to go behind my back
Girl, you're lyin' straight through your teeth
Lights, camera, action
Karma’s back at it
And you’re jumpin' back to we
'Cause that old boy done did you dirty
The same way you did me
[Chorus]
And I got you
Blowin' up my phone
'Cause you don’t wanna be alone
Closed that door on me
And I ain't never comin' home (Never comin' home)
Aw, naw (Aw, naw)
I ain't never comin' home
I said goodbye
Don't make me say it twice
Now I'm a rolling stone
And I ain't never coming home (Never comin' home)
Never coming home[Bridge]
Girl, we were shinin'
Then you two timed it
Two facing me, aw, ya shady, baby
Why you tryin'?
Ain't no silver linin'
Coming back to me, don't be crazy, baby
[Chorus]
And I got you
Blowin' up my phone
'Cause you don't wanna be alone
Closed that door on me
And I ain't never comin' home
Aw, oh
And I got you
Blowin' up my phone
'Cause you don't wanna be alone
Closed that door on me
And I ain't never coming home (Never coming home)
Aw, naw (Aw, naw)
I ain't never coming home
[Outro]
I said goodbye
Don't make me say it twice
Now I'm a rollin' stone
And I ain't never coming home (Never coming home)
Aw, naw
Ain't never, never, never coming home
