[Verse 1: Anthony Kiedis]
Gettin' born in the state of Mississippi
Poppa was a copper and her momma was a hippie
In Alabama, she would swing a hammer
Price you gotta pay when you break the panorama
[Pre-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
She never knew that there was anything more than poor
What in the world does your company take me for?
[Verse 2: Anthony Kiedis]
Black bandana, sweet Louisiana
Robbin' a bank in the state of Indiana
She's a runner, rebel and a stunner
On her merry way sayin', "Baby, what you gonnaâ€”?"
[Pre-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
Lookin' down the barrel of a hot metal .45
Just another way to survive
[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
California, rest in peace
Simultaneous release
California, show your teeth
She's my priestess, I'm your priest, yeah, yeah
