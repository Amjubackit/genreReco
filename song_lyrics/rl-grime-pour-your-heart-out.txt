[Verse]
You poured your heart out in my cup, yeah
But I let that cup spill
We can pick it up still
Met you in the club, yeah
So you know what's up
You know who I was, yeah
Wake up the birds, sing me a song
Maybe, maybe we can dream there again
It's too late to try to save you, my love
(Can't save you, my love)
[Chorus]
You poured your heart out in my cup, yeah
But I let that cup spill
We can pick it up still
You can't really trust them
Played you like a game, babe
Now you don't know what's real
[Post-Chorus]
All that I know is
We can't control it
So let's just go for it
Yeah, I'm too faded
I'm too numb
I can't even feel your love, yeah
[Chorus]
You poured your heart out in my cup, yeah
But I let that cup spill
We can pick it up still
You can't really trust them
Played you like a game, babe
Now you don't know what's real
[Post-Chorus]
All that I know is
We can't control it
So let's just go for it
Yeah, I'm too faded
I'm too numb
I can't even feel your love, yeah
[Verse]
You poured your heart out in my cup, yeah
But I let that cup spill
We can pick it up still
Met you in the club, yeah
So you know what's up
You know who I was, yeah
Wake up the birds, sing me a song
Maybe, maybe we can dream there again
It's too late to try to save you, my love
(Can't save you, my love)
[Chorus]
You poured your heart out in my cup, yeah
But I let that cup spill
We can pick it up still
You can't really trust them
Played you like a game, babe
Now you don't know what's real
[Post-Chorus]
All that I know is
We can't control it
So let's just go for it
Yeah, I'm too faded
I'm too numb
I can't even feel your love, yeah
