[Intro: Vic Fuentes]
You're my favorite explosion
(You know the only real way to cure pain is to add a little more
Because everything new distracts the old)
[Verse 1: Vic Fuentes]
A violin with no hands plays symphonies
With no words (With no words)
A drowning boy with no voice prays
Someone up there's telling me
You'd better not get back up!
I spit my heart into this red cup
I'd better pick it back up, it might ruin your night
And she said
[Pre-Chorus: Vic Fuentes, and 
Vanessa Harris
]
Baby, leave the water by the bed for later
And I woke up without a single drop
[Chorus: Vic Fuentes]
I told myself
"I'm tired of holding up your backup plans"
Go down your list and be satisfied
It's all you have, it's not enough
[Verse 2: Vic Fuentes]
(True love comes from more than just the heart)
She said paint a picture on me
Throw your dress up and your heart away
Yeah, I heard what you said
A friend of a friend, these strangers at the party never paid
And if that doesn't turn you on
I'll keep talking 'till something does
As we're covered in sand, you roll over and smile
