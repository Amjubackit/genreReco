[Intro: Jess Higgs]
Ooh-ooh, now ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, now ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, now ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, now ooh-ooh
[Verse 1: Jess Higgs]
You know I used to be alright
When you woke me in the morning
Waiting for the sun to shine
And do the two-step all night
Then you'd spin me 'round and catch me
Laughing as the sun would rise, sun would rise
[Pre-Chorus: Jess Higgs]
Oh, I don't know what to do
You speak a foreign language when you put me through
The enemies, I know you're hiding one or two
But I just can't say no to you
[Chorus: Jess Higgs]
So I can't let you go and you won't let me know
I can't let you go and you won't say
I can't let you go but you won't let me know
I can't let you go, I, I slip away
