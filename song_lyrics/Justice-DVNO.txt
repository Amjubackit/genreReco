[Verse 1]
It's always the same, always ashamed
Storytellin' when I can't come in (Oh)
To a hopeless troglodyte
But one more time, my answer stands
I swear, I mean no offense
But you better learn to read (Ah)
It's all about membership
[Verse 2]
I spell it for the young and old
Ugly girls and boys
I put you on my list and make you clap to this
Is it mayhem or just an ego trip?
But only one can win
And soon you'll say, "That's him"
[Chorus]
D-V-N-O, four capital letters
Printed in gold 'cause details make the girls sweat
Even more while they're shaking their belts
No need to ask my name to figure out how cool I am
D-V-N-O, four capital letters
Printed in gold 'cause details make the girls sweat
Even more while they're shaking their belts
No need to ask my name to figure out how cool I am
