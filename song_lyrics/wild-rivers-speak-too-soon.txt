Came my way on a summer day
Flying out of broken soil
Safe to say that you blinded me
I saw you when my sight was sore
Met your lips in the dead of night
And took you on the kitchen floor
Good god, I got it bad for you babe
Guess I don’t know anything about it
Guess I thought you were preaching to an empty room
And I’ll tell you how I feel but I don’t want to speak too soon
So I just pray it’s all true
Well you don’t know much about me
I’ll explain it as best I can
I’m afraid of getting rich just to find out
It was fools gold in my pan
Time is wasted on a boy who is faking
Pretending just to be a man
Good god, I got it bad for you babe
Guess I don’t know anything about it
Guess I thought you were preaching to an empty room
And I’ll tell you how I feel but I don’t want to speak too soon
So I just pray it’s all trueOh, and I just pray it’s all true
Guess I don’t know anything about it
Guess I thought you were preaching to an empty room
And I’ll tell you how I feel but I don’t want to speak too soon
So I just pray it’s all true
