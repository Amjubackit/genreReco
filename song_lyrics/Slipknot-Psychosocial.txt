[Intro: Corey Taylor]
Ooh, 
yeah
[Verse 1: Corey Taylor]
I did my time, and I want out
So effusive, fade, it doesn't cut, the soul is not so vibrant
The reckoning, the sickening
Packaging subversion,
 pseudo-sacrosanct perversion
Go drill your deserts, go dig your graves
Then fill your mouth with all the money you will save
Sinking in, getting smaller again
I'm done, it has begun, I'm not the only one
[Chorus: Corey Taylor]
And the rain will kill us all
Throw ourselves against the wall
But no one else can see
The preservation of the martyr in me
[Post-Chorus: Clown, Chris Fehn, & Paul Gray]
Psychosocial, psychosocial, psychosocial
Psychosocial, psychosocial, psychosocial
[Verse 2: Corey Taylor]
There are cracks in the road we laid
But where the temple fell, the secrets have gone mad
This is nothing new, but when we killed it all
The hate was all we had
Who needs another mess? We could start over
Just look me in the eyes and say I'm wrong
Now there's only emptiness, venomous, insipid
I think we're done, I'm not the only one
