[Intro]
And the hand of the Lord was on me, and he brought me out by
The Spirit of the Lord to the middle of a valley full of bones
Full of bones
[Chorus]
I should be at church but I'm ragin' on a Sunday
Lot to confess, fuck it, worry 'bout it some day
Baptizin' the crowd 'cause they lookin' pretty thirsty
(Save me from myself and take me to the promised land)
[Verse 1]
This is a chapel and these words, your religion
Raise your cup for that 
holy grail
 that you're sippin'
Free up your mind, I know that it can be a prison
We ain't got much time, you better spend what you were given
[Chorus]
I should be at church but I'm ragin' on a Sunday
Lot to confess, fuck it, worry 'bout it some day
Baptizin' the crowd 'cause they lookin' pretty thirsty
(Save me from myself and take me to the promised land)
I should be at church but I'm ragin' on a Sunday
Lot to confess, fuck it, worry 'bout it some day
Baptized in the crowd 'cause they lookin' pretty thirsty
(I should be at church but I'm ragin' on a Sunday)
