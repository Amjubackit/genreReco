No Lord I need a little soul
No Lord I need a little soul
To clear my head
To clear my head
When the heat begins to roar
No no no no
No no no no
Oh the doctor got another for me
(Oh the doctor got another for me)
Oh the doctor got another for me
(Oh the doctor got another for me)
To cure these shakes
(Shakes)
To cure these shakes
(Shakes)
When the heat's risin' up in me
No no no no
No no no no
‘Cause this ain't my head
‘Cause this ain't my it won't leave me be
It won't leave me be
It won't leave me be
I know you got it livin' in you
(I know you got it livin' in you)
I know you got it livin' in you
(I know you got it livin' in you)
‘Cause you don't move
(Move)
‘Cause you don't move
(Move)
Unless there's heat rising up in you
No no no no
No no no no
‘Cause this ain't my head
‘Cause this ain't my it won't leave me be
It won't leave me be
