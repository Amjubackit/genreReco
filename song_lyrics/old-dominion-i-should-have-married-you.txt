[Verse 1]
We were walkin' down the boardwalk
Watchin' stars out on the ocean
We were drunk on margaritas
And that might've been my moment
But we stood there in silence
And watched the waves crash
[Verse 2]
Vacation with your family
After midnight, in the kitchen
I was hangin' with your dad
I coulda asked him but I didn't
I don't know why, I guess I thought I had more time
[Pre-Chorus]
If I hadn't been so young and stupid
Yeah, I let somebody beat me to it
Don't know what you got until you lose it
Guess I blew it, baby
I should have married you
[Chorus]
That's just the way it goes
I should've seen it through
I should've let you know
I should've said, "I do"
Back when I still had the chance, yeah
I should have married you
[Verse 3]
Maybe I thought I needed freedom
Maybe it's all about the timing
Maybe I wouldn't let my ego
Let somebody tie me down
Aw, but I can't blame you for not waitin' around
[Pre-Chorus]
If I hadn't been so young and stupid (I wish I would've known, wish I would've known)
Yeah, I let somebody beat me to it (Whoa, yeah)
Don't know what you got until you lose it
Guess I blew it, baby
I should have married you
[Chorus]
That's just the way it goes (Way it goes)
I should've seen it through (Seen it through)
I should've let you know (Let you know)
I should've said, "I do" (Said, "I do")
Back when I still had the chance, yeah
I should have married you
[Bridge]
Whoa-oh, oh
Whoa-oh, oh
[Pre-Chorus]
If I hadn't been so young and stupid (I wish I would've known, wish I would've known)
I let somebody beat me to it (Whoa, yeah)
Don't know what you got until you lose it
Guess I blew it, baby
I should have married you
[Chorus]
That's just the way it goes (Way it goes)
I should've seen it through (Seen it through)
I should've let you know (Let you know)
I should've said, "I do" (Said, "I do")
Back when I still had the chance, yeah
I should have married you
Back when I still had the chance, yeah
I should have married you
