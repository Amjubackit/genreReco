[Verse 1]
I'm exhausted watching 
like Claire Danes through the water
Kitchen light like blades through your body
The party's ablaze
We grew apart when you were fighting with your sister, I
Don't think I realised how horribly I miss you now
Regret is flowering inside me while I'm scooping ice
[Chorus]
Hope you know that I, I just don't know what to do
'Cause I only want to be with you
[Verse 2]
I remember there was something strangely romantic
In our friendship, we were dramatic
I wept in your arms
Talking for hours on thе gravel, letting our backs burn
Walking to Boxers linking pinkiеs, wearing matching pearls
And now I'm struggling, I'm choking up without the words
[Chorus]
Hope you know that I, I just don't know what to do
'Cause I only want to be with you
I just miss your voice
Saying we're alright
Callin' when you're lonely, late at night
'Cause I only want to be with you
