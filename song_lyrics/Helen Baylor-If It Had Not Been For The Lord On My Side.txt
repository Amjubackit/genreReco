[Chorus]
If it had not been for the Lord on my side
Where would I be? Where would I be?
If it had not been for the Lord on my side
Where would I be? Where would I be?
[Verse 1]
He kept my enemies away
He let the sun shine through a cloudy day
Oh, he wrapped me in the cradle of his arms
When he knew I'd been battered and torn
So...
[Chorus]
[Verse 2]
He never left me all alone
He gave me peace and joy I've never known
He answered when I knelt down to pray
And in victory, the Lord showed me the way
[Chorus]
