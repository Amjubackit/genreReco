[Chorus]
Takin' one last drive down Main
Might as well be memory lane
Turn it up for old time's sake
Takin' one last drive down Main
Life packed in the Chevrolet
Every corner, I see your face
Two hearts break, only one can stay
Takin' one last drive down Main
[Verse 1]
Pedal down anywhere but here
County line or Nashville, I don't care
No brakes to the moon, long as you're not there
You're not there, you're not there
Whеn did it all go South?
Wish I could hate this town
Turns out that it's just not big enough for the both of us
So I'm just
[Chorus]
Takin' onе last drive down Main
Might as well be memory lane
Turn it up for old time's sake
Takin' one last drive down Main
Life packed in the Chevrolet
Every corner, I see your face
Two hearts break, only one can stay
Takin' one last drive down Main
[Verse 2]
Yeah, I can see it now
You'll hit the bar, get your buzz off a couple drinks
Tell your friends, you'll be just fine without me
But I'll be there in your mind when you fall asleep
Bet you dream, I bet you dream about
Me and you makin' out in the driveway
Now it's all rearview, behind me
And baby, somehow, we got sideways
So before I hit that highway
[Chorus]
Takin' one last drive down Main
Might as well be memory lane
Turn it up for old time's sake
Takin' one last drive down Main
Life packed in the Chevrolet
Every corner, I see your face
Two hearts break, only one can stay
Takin' one last drive down Main
[Instrumental Break]
[Bridge]
Pedal down anywhere but here
County line or Nashville, I don't care
No brakes to the moon, long as you're not there
You're not there, you're not there
[Chorus]
Takin' one last drive down Main
Might as well be memory lane
Turn it up for old time's sake
Takin' one last drive down Main
Life packed in the Chevrolet
Every corner, I see your face
Two hearts break, only one can stay
Takin' one last drive down Main
