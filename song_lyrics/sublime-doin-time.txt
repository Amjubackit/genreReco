[Chorus]
Summertime,
 
and the livin's easy
Bradley's on the microphone with Ras M.G.​
All people in the dance will agree that we're
Well qualified to represent the L.B.C.​
G, me and Louie, we gon' run to the party
Dance to the rhythm, it gets harder
(
And we can do it like this, in the place to be
)
[Verse 1]
Me and my girl, we got this relationship
I love her so bad, but she treats me like sh…
On lockdown, like a penitentiary
She spreads her lovin' all over and when she gets home, there's none left for me
[Chorus]
Summertime,
 
and the livin's easy
Bradley's on the microphone with Ras M.G.​
All people in the dance will agree that we're
Well qualified to represent the L.B.C.​
G, me and Louie, we gon' run to the party
Dance to the rhythm, it gets harder
(
And we can do it like this, in the place to be
)
[Verse 2]
Oh, take this veil from off my eyes
My burning sun will someday rise
So, what am I gonna be doin' for a while? Said, I'm gonna play with myself
Show them, now, we've come off the shelf
(So what?)[Chorus]
Summertime,
 
and the livin's easy
Bradley's on the microphone with Ras M.G.​
All people in the dance will agree that we're
Well qualified to represent the L.B.C.​
G, we and Louie, run to the party
Dance to the rhythm, it gets harder
(
And we can do it like this, in the place to be
)
[Verse 3]
Evil, I've come to tell you that she's evil, most definitely
Evil, ornery, scandalous and evil, most definitely
The tension, it's getting harder
I'd like to hold her head underwater
[Bridge]
Me and my girl, we've got a relationship
Me and my girl, mmm, we got a relationship, mmm-hmm
My girl, we got a relationship, oh
And my girl, yeah, got a relationship
[Chorus]
Take a tip, take a tip
Take a ti-ti-ti-tip from me
Bradley's on the microphone with Ras M.G.​
All people in the dance will agree that we're
Well qualified to represent the L.B.C.​
Me, la-la-Louie
While everybody run to the rhythm, it gets harder
(
And we can do it like this, in the place to be
)[Outro]
Summertime, and the livin's easy
*Louie barking*
(
And we can do it like this, in the place to be
)
