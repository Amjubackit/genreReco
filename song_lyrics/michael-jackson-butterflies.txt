Butterflies

Da de-de-da, da-da

Da de-de-da de-de-da
(Oh I, oh I)
Da de-de de-da, lda de-da-dum
Da de -de -de -da, da-dum, da-dum, da-dum
Butterflies, inside
[Verse 1]
All you got to do is walk away and pass me by
Don't acknowledge my smile
When I try to say hello to you, yeah
And all you gotta do is not answer my call
When I'm trying to get through
Keep me wondering why, when all I can do is sigh
I just wanna touch you
[Chorus]
I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight (You give me)
'Cause you give me butterflies
Inside, inside and I
[Verse 2]
All I gotta say is that I must be dreamin', can't be real
You're not here with me
Still I can feel you near to me, yeah
I caress you, let you taste us, just so blissful listen
I would give you anything baby
Just make my dreams come true
Oh, baby, you give me butterflies
[Chorus]
I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight (You give me)
Ah, 'cause you give me butterflies
Inside, inside and I
I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight (You give me)
Ah, 'cause you give me butterflies
Inside, inside and I
[Bridge]
If you will take my hand, baby, I will show you
Guide you to the light, then
If you will be my love, baby, I will love you
Love you, 'til the end of time
[Chorus: Michael Jackson & Marsha Ambrosius]
I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight (Girl, you give me)
Ah, you give me butterflies
Inside, inside and I (I just wanna touch you)
I just wanna touch and kiss (I wanna, I wanna, be with you, girl)
And I wish that I could be with you tonight (Talk to me, baby) (Inside)
Ah, you give me butterflies
Inside, inside and I
I just wanna touch and kiss (I wanna touch you)
And I wish that I could be with you tonight (Butterflies)
Ah, you give me butterflies
Inside, inside and I
I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight
Ah, you give me butterflies
Inside, inside and I
I just wanna touch and kiss (I wanna, I wanna, be with you, girl)
And I wish that I could be with you tonight (Wanna be with you) (You give me)
Ah, you give me butterflies
Inside, inside and I
