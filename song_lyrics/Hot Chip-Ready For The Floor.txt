[Intro: Alexis Taylor]
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it now
Say it, say it, say it, say it, say it, say it, say it now
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it now
Say it, say it, say it, say it, say it, say it, say it now
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it now
[Chorus: Alexis Taylor]
Instead of carving up the wall
Why don't you open up with talk?
I am ready, I am ready for a fall
Instead of carving up the wall
Why don't you open up with talk?
We are ready, we are ready for the floor
[Verse 1: Alexis Taylor & 
Joe Goddard
]
I can't hear your voice, do I have a choice?
I'm hoping with chance you might take this dance
I can't hear your voice, do I have a choice?
You're sinking below, I'm using my force
I'm hoping with chance you might take this dance
You're my number one guy
[Chorus: Alexis Taylor]
Instead of carving up the wall
Why don't you open up with talk?
I am ready, I am ready for a fall
Instead of carving up the wall
Why don't you open up with talk?
We are ready, we are ready for the floor
