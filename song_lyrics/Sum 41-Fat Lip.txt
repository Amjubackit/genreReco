[Verse 1]
Stormin' through the party like my name was El Ni√±o
When I'm hangin' out drinkin' in the back of an El Camino
As a kid, was a skid, and no one knew me by name
Trashed my own house party 'cause nobody came
[Pre-Chorus]
Well, I know I'm not the one you thought you knew back in high school
Never goin', never showin' up when we had to
Attention that we crave
Don't tell us to behave
I'm sick of always hearin' "act your age"
[Chorus]
I don't wanna waste my time
Become another casualty of society
I'll never fall in line
Become another victim of your conformity and back down
[Verse 2]
Because you don't know us at all, we laugh when old people fall
But what would you expect with a conscience so small?
Heavy metal and mullets, it's how we were raised
Maiden and Priest were the gods that we praised
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause we like havin' fun at other people's expense, and
Cuttin' people down is just a minor offense, then
It's none of your concern
I guess I'll never learn
I'm sick of being told to wait my turn
