[Chorus]
Valentina, baby
I only need one moment of time
To make you feel a way
From the first time I looked in your eyes
I knew that I would find a way
To make you mine
[Verse]
I know it's late, and I know you got a man (I know it's late)
Please understand, baby, he won't (Baby, he won't)
Love you like I do (Like I do)
Give me a break, I know that you want me too (Give me a break)
You're loyal it's cool, I understand (I understand)
And I respect it
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, ohh)
[Chorus]
Valentina, baby
I only need one moment of time (Moment of time)
To make you feel a way
From the first time I looked in your eyes
I knew that I would find a way
To make you mine
