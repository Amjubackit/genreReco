[Intro]
A record of the delightful piece
They're going to play this evening
Ladies and gentlemen
Ladies and gentlemen
Ladies and gentlemen
Ladies and gentlemen
Ladies and gentlemen

Ladies and gentlemen
Your attention please
[Pre-Chorus]
And now, the moment we've been waiting for is here
I- I have something to tell you
[Chorus]
Que sera, sera
Que sera, sera
Que sera, sera
Que sera, sera
Whatever will be
(Remember) Will be
(Remember) Will be
