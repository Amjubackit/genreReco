[Verse 1]
I've been gone for a minute
Been low key with my business
Askin', "Rita, who is it? Is it true?" ("Is it true?")
I've been takin' off every weekend
You and I in our feelings
'Cause the high's so much better with you (With you)
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, my God, been a hell of a ride
But you feel like a religion (Ah-ooh)
And who knew love would leave me feelin' this good?
I have to praise you like I should
[Chorus]
I have to praise you (Ooh-ooh-ooh, hey)
I have to praise you (Ooh-ooh-ooh, hey)
I have to praise you (Ooh-ooh-ooh, hey)
I have to praise you like I should
[Verse 2]
Now it's four in the morning
Man, it never gets boring
Friends say, "Shut up about it," I can't stop
It's written all over my face
You got me realigning my faith
That's the kinda thing that needs praise
Oh, ah[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, my God, been a hell of a ride
But you feel like a religion (Ah-ooh)
And who knew love would leave me feelin' this good?
I have to praise you like I should
[Chorus]
I have to praise you
Have to praise you (Ooh-ooh-ooh, hey)
I have to praise you (Ooh-ooh-ooh, hey)
I have to praise you (Ooh-ooh-ooh, hey)
I have to praise you like I should
[Bridge]
Don't know, don't know what you do
But I'm a-a-always praising you
Don't know, don't know what you do
But I'm a-a-always praising you
Don't know, don't know what you do
But I'm a-a-always praising you
Don't know, don't know what you do
But I'm a-a-always praising you (I have to)
[Chorus]
I have to praise you (Ooh-ooh-ooh, hey)
I have to praise you (Ooh-ooh-ooh, hey)
I have to praise you (Ooh-ooh-ooh, hey)
I have to praise you like I should
I have to praise you (Ooh-ooh-ooh, hey)
(But I'm a-a-always praising you)
I have to praise you (Ooh-ooh-ooh, hey)
(But I'm a-a-always praising you)
I have to praise you (Ooh-ooh-ooh, hey)
(But I'm a-a-always praising you)
I have to praise you like I should
