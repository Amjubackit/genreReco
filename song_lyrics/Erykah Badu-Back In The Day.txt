Back in the day now
[Hook]
Back in the day when things were cool, hey
All we needed was bop-bop, bop-bop, bop-ba-domp
Ooh, bop-bop, bop-bop, bop-ba-domp
Well, well, well
Back in the day when things were cool, hey
All we needed was bop-bop, bop-bop, bop-ba-domp
Ooh, bop-bop, bop-bop, bop-ba-domp
Well, well, well
Soulflower take me flying with you, hey
Gimme dat bop-bop, bop-bop, bop-ba-domp
Gimme some of dat bop-bop, bop-bop, bop-ba-domp
Well, well, well
[Verse]
Back in the day when things were cool
We used to meet up with these dudes, hey
Then we rode out on Voges and Trues
And would ride around the park till it's after dark
Pumpin' the trunk with the windows rolled up, puff
Well, well, well say
[Hook]
Back in the day when things were cool, hey
All we needed was bop-bop, bop-bop, bop-ba-domp
Ooh, bop-bop, bop-bop, bop-ba-domp
Well, well, well
Back in the day when things were cool, hey
All we needed was bop-bop, bop-bop, bop-ba-domp
Ooh, bop-bop, bop-bop, bop-ba-domp
Well, well, well
