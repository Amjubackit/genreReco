[Intro]
Holding you
Couldn't be alone, couldn't be alone, couldn't be alone
Loving you
Couldn't be alone, couldn't be alone, couldn't be alone
Kissing you
[Chorus]
Holding you
Couldn't be alone, couldn't be alone, couldn't be alone
Loving you
Couldn't be alone, couldn't be alone, couldn't be alone
Kissing you
Tell me I belong, tell me I belong, tell me I belong
Holding you
Couldn't be alone, couldn't be alone, couldn't be alone
Loving you
Couldn't be alone, couldn't be alone, couldn't be alone
Kissing you
Tell me I belong, tell me I belong, tell me I belong
[Post-Chorus]
Watching you
Watching you
Watching you
