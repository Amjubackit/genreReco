[Verse 1]
You will never leave
Your love sustaining me
Before I even knew
What love was
[Verse 2]
You’ve brought me here to rest
And given me space to breathe
So I’ll stay still until
It sinks in
[Chorus]
I will lean back in the loving arms
Of a beautiful Father
Breathe deep and know that He is good
He’s a love like no other
[Verse 1]
You will never leave
Your love sustaining me
Before I even knew
What love was
[Verse 2]
You’ve brought me here to rest
And given me space to breathe
So I’ll stay still until
It sinks in[Chorus]
I will lean back in the loving arms
Of a beautiful Father
Breathe deep and know that He is good
He’s a love like no other
[Interlude]
[Bridge]
Now I can see Your love is better
Than all the others that I’ve seen
I'm breathing deep all of Your goodness
And Your loving-kindness to me
Now I can see Your love is better
Than all the others that I’ve seen
I'm breathing deep all of Your goodness
And Your loving-kindness to me
Now I can see Your love is better
Than all the others that I’ve seen
I'm breathing deep all of Your goodness
And Your loving-kindness to me
[Chorus]
And I will lean back in the loving arms
Of a beautiful Father
I'll breathe deep and know that He is good
He is a love like no other (Oh, He is, oh, He is)
So I will lean back in the loving arms
Of a beautiful Father (Oh, God, oh, God)
Breathe deep and know that He is good
He is a love like no other
Lean back in the loving arms
Of a beautiful Father
Breathe deep and know that He is good
He is a love like no other
