[Instrumental Intro]
[Verse 1]
I don't know too much about love baby now
But I sure think I got it bad, yeah
I don't know too much about love baby now
But I sure think I got it bad, yeah
Some people say love is just a gamble
Ooh whatever it is about to drive me mad, yeah
Yeah, lookout
[Verse 2]
I sit here in my lonely room now
Tears flowin' down my eyes
As I sit here in my lonely room now
Tears flowin' down my eyes
I wonder how you can treat me so low down and dirty
You know what?
Your heart must be made out of ice, yeah
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
Sometimes I get so worried baby now
You know I wanna sit down and cry myself to sleep
Sometimes I get so worried baby now
You know I wanna sit down and cry myself to sleep
â€˜Cause I don't know too much about love babe
But I sure think I...
Sure think I...
Got it bad, yeahOh, I sure think I got it bad, yeah
