[Intro]
Oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh
[Verse 1]
You got a figure like a pin-up, got a figure like a doll
Don't care if you think I'm dumb, I don't care at all
Candy bear, sweetie pie, wanna be adored
I'm the girl you'd die for
[Pre-Chorus]
I'll chew you up and I'll spit you out
'Cause that's what young love is all about
So pull me closer and kiss me hard
I'm gonna pop your bubblegum heart
[Chorus]
I'm Miss Sugar Pink, liquor, liquor lips
Hit me with your sweet love, steal me with a kiss
I'm Miss Sugar Pink, liquor, liquor lips
I'm gonna be your bubblegum bitch
I'm gonna be your bubblegum bitch
[Interlude]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh
