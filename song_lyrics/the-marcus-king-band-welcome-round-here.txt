Boy you ain't welcome ’round these parts no more
Boy you better take yourself back home
Boy you ain't welcome 'round these parts no more
Heard the things you sing about in your songs
Well you talk about treason, you talk about lust
Keep your heathen ways away from us
Let me live my life, way that I was raised
Boy I recommend you do the same
Boy I recommend you do the same
If your momma was still living
I believe she’d die of shame
Hurt yourself, you cursed the family name
Know I'll always love you, you'll always be my kin
Don't you show your face 'round here again
They said don't you show your face 'round here again
When St. Peter opens up them pearly gates
He's gonna look down but he ain’t gonna find your name
Well don’t trust your mind to do all them things it's telling you
Listen to the words I say as true
Listen to the words I say as true
