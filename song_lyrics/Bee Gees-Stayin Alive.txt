[Verse 1]
Well, you can tell by the way I use my walk
I'm a woman's man, no time to talk
The music loud and the women warm
I've been kicked around since I was born
[Pre-Chorus]
And now it's alright, it's okay
And you may look the other way
But we can try to understand
The New York Times' effect on man
[Chorus]
Whether you're a 
brother
 or whether you're a 
mother
You're stayin' alive,
 stayin' alive
Feel the city breakin' and everybody shakin'
And we're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Stayin' alive
Oh, when you walk
[Verse 2]
Well now, I get low and I get high
And if I can't get either, I really try
Got the wings of Heaven on my shoes
I'm a dancin' man and I just can't lose
