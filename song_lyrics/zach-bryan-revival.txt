[Verse 1]
Gather 'round this table, boys
Bring your shame, I'll lose my voice
Screaming at the gods about the bad we've done
Merle said Mama tried, but the prison still won
[Verse 2]
Your transgressions are mine as well
Anger grows in my bones if you could not tell
But I'll find comfort in company
Lord, forgive us, my boys and me
[Chorus]
We're having an all-night revival
Someone call the women and someone steal the Bible
For the sake of my survival
Baptize me in a bottle of Beam, put Johnny on the vinyl
[Verse 2]
Well, the devil can scrap but the Lord has won
And I'll talk to him under risin' sun
His son rose and mine did too
I was coming down, but now I'm talkin' to you
[Chorus]
'Cause we're having an all-night revival
Someone call the women and someone steal the Bible
For the sake of my survival
Baptize me in a bottle of Beam, put Johnny on the vinyl
[Chorus]
So we're having an all-night revival
Someone call the women and someone steal the Bible
For the sake of my survival
Baptize me in a bottle of Beam, put Johnny on the vinyl
[Outro]
Gather 'round this table, boys
Bring your shame, I'll lose my voice
Screaming at the gods about the bad we've done
Merle said Mama tried, but the prison still won
