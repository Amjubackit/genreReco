[Intro: Big Shizz]
What? EC
Check it out, yeah
[Chorus: Erica Campbell]
I love God, you don't love God?
What's wrong with you?
I love God, you don't love God?
What's wrong with you?
[Verse 1: Erica Campbell]
I don't think that I could live no other way
Truth be told, I'm livin' how I wanna, ayy
Nah, this ain't them blessings in the modern day
The Lord I serve, He gives 'em to me every day
[Pre-Chorus: Erica Campbell]
I'm forgiven, I'm forgiven (Ayy, ayy)
See, I done been forgiven, now I'm livin' (Ayy, ayy)
And when I say I love, I mean it
'Cause none of this means nothin' if He comes and I miss Him, shawty
[Chorus: Erica Campbell]
I luh God, you don't luh God?
What's wrong with you?
I luh God, you don't luh God?
What's wrong with you?
[Post-Chorus: LaShawn Daniels]
I Love him, I love him
Love him, I lo—
Love him, I love him
Love him, I love him, I love him
Love him, I love him, I love him
La-love him, love him, I—
Love him, I love him, love him
La-love him, I love him!
[Verse 2: Erica Campbell]
You ain't got the money moving by yourself
And you know you did it with a lot of help
You know it's only One, it ain't nobody else
You got me talking strong, and I ain't rich, I'm talking wealth
See, I'm forgiven, I'm forgiven
See, I done been forgiven, now I'm living
And when I say I love, I mean it
'Cause none of this means nothing if he comes and I miss him, shawty
[Chorus: Erica Campbell]
I luh God, you don't luh God?
What's wrong with you?
I luh God, you don't luh God?
What's wrong with you?
[Post-Chorus: LaShawn Daniels]
I Love him, I love him
Love him, I lo—
Love him, I love him
Love him, I love him, I love him
Love him, I love him, I love him
La-love him, love him, I—
Love him, I love him, love him
La-love him, I love him!
[Bridge: Erica Campbell]
Wanted you to fall (Wanted you to fall, I do)
You remember? I do, I do (Oh, I do, I do)
You could've lost it all (You've could've lost it all)
You remember? I do, I do (I do, I do)
No one could throw you off, oh he got you covered
Protect us from it all, that's what makes me love him
I don't need a reason to fall on my knees and
Tell him how I feel in my heart
And let him know
[Chorus: Erica Campbell]
I luh God, you don't luh God?
What's wrong with you?
I luh God, you don't luh God?
What's wrong with you?
[Post-Chorus: LaShawn Daniels]
I Love him, I love him
Love him, I lo—
Love him, I love him
Love him, I love him, I love him
Love him, I love him, I love him
La-love him, love him, I—
Love him, I love him, love him
La-love him, I love him!
