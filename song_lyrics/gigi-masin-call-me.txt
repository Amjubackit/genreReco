Search me
Find me
Kiss me
Call me (Love)
Search me
Blind me
Kiss me
Call me
Young then the younger love
Pale like the whiter dove
Spread your wings and
Let me in
Sailing the sea unsailed
Writing the song unplayed
Stop your boat and
Let me in
Shouting the words unsaid
Crying the wrongs unpaid
Shut your mouth and
Drown me in
Young then the younger love
Pale like the whiter dove
Spread your wings and
Let me in
Search me
Find me
Kiss me
Call me
Search me
Blind me
Kiss me
Call me
