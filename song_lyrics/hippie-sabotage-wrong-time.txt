[Verse 1]
I was in the wrong time, and right place
And I never should have looked into your face
And I always thought that we could maintain
And I never meant to cause you no pain
Why I always got to feel bad, to feel good
Why you always got to talk back, when you shouldn't
I don't got no time for problems, I'm good
And I only want to progress, like you should
[Chorus]
There's no going back and forth now, no banging on the door loud
All these 4 AM fights got me pourin' out
Trynna rip my soul out, god told me hold out
I'm on the road to pay my rent you said I sold out
[Bridge]
I'ma stick around until its cold out here
You're either with me or against me, I'ma stand out (yeah)
Until death I know you'll miss me at the end of the year
But the truth is just something that you should not fear
[Verse 1]
I was like right time, right place
And I know I take a look into your face
And all I think is we can maintain
And I never want to cause you no pain
Why I always got to feel bad, when you're good
Why I always got to talk back, when I shouldn't
We ain't got no time for problems, when we should
Man I only want to progress, like we could
[Chorus]
There's no going back and forth now, no banging on the door loud
Up at 4 a.m. laughing on the floor now
Trynna get my soul out, but god told me hold out
I'm on the road to pay the rent for our own house
[Bridge]
'cause we gonna stick around until its cold out here
You're either with us or against us, yeah we will stand out (yeah)
Until death I know I'll kiss you at the end of the year
See the truth is just something that I'll never fear
[Verse 2]
I was like wrong time, wrong place
Can't you see that fucking look in my face
When I always thought that we could go and maintain and make changes
Never meant to ever go that way
But I don't feel bad, I feel good
I don't ever got to talk back, like I should
We don't really got no problems, we good
Man we only got our progress, we good
