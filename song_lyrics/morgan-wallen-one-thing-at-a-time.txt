[Verse 1]
Somebody hand me a cigarette
I know I ain't had one in over a week
Somebody pour me a double shot
Been gettin' better by the day, but tonight I drink
[Pre-Chorus]
You say I gotta get over you and get sober too
I got a lot of habits I gotta kick
But weigh out all your options and take your pick
[Chorus]
I can either burn the bar down
Or I can take your number out my phone
I can give you up right now
And never want you back long as I'm half-stoned
If you want me to quit you, want me to get you
Outta my heart and, baby, off my mind
I hate to tell you, girl, but I'm only quittin' one thing at a time
[Verse 2]
I know I got me some problems
About a thousand memories I gotta forgеt
But if I'm gonna solve 'em
Baby, I'll take all thе help I can get
