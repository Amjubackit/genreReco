[Verse 1]
Air in my lungs
'Til the road begins
As the last of the bugs
Leave their homes again
And I'm splitting the road down the middle
For a minute the world seemed so simple
[Verse 2]
Feel the rush of my blood
I'm seventeen again
I am not scared of death
I've got dreams again
It's just me and the curve 
of the valley
And there is meaning on Earth, 
I am happy
[Pre-Chorus]
(Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
[Chorus]
Passed Alger Brook road,
 I'm over the bridge
A minute from home, but I feel so far from it
The death of my dog
, 
the stretch of my skin
It's all washin' over me, I'm angry again
The things that I lost here, the people I knew
They got me surrounded for a mile or two
The cars in reverse, I'm grippin' the wheel
I'm back between villages and everything's still
