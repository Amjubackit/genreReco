Baby, I need light, I need fire
I need to know, that I'm alive
I need love, baby I need love

Take me down everybody down, take me down
Down to the bottom
Take me down everybody down, take me down
Down to the bottom

Baby, I need hale, she calls my name
Out in the desert, I pray for rain

Take me down everybody down, take me down
Down to the bottom
Take me down everybody down, take me down
