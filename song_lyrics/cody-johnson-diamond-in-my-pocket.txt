[Verse 1]
Saturday night and the moon is out
Just shinin' over top of the pines
I'm headin' on down to my baby's house
Gonna take her on a midnight ride
Down them backroads winding up at Kickapoo Creek
Dancin' and singin' to some good ol' boys like me
[Chorus]
Baby, there's a shooting star
That one's for me and you
So hold me tight and make that wish and pray that it comes true
I ain't sure of much but this I know
I got a diamond in my pocket and my baby's got a heart of gold
[Verse 2]
I brought along a little courage and a Coleman cooler
Just to help me out
My hands are shaking like a Canebrake rattler
Nothing's gonna save me now
Might as well jump in head first, lay it all on the line
What am I worrying about, never gonna be a more perfect time
[Chorus]
Cause baby, there's a shooting star
That one's for me and you
So, hold me tight and make that wish and pray that it comes true
I ain't sure of much but this I know
I got a diamond in my pocket and my baby's got a heart of gold[Bridge]
Well I didn't have money for a Broadway show
But the crickets are singing to the radio
And we got tickets on the very front row
[Chorus]
Baby, there's a shooting star
That one's for me and you
So hold me tight and make that wish and pray that it comes true
I ain't sure of much but this I know
I got a diamond in my pocket and my baby's got a heart of gold
I got a diamond in my pocket and my baby's got a heart of gold
