[Verse 1]
Moving slow
Heart is beating faster than you'll ever know
Feeling high
Riding on towards a lover's paradise
Letting go
All of these emotions we were scared to show
Energized
I can see a brighter future in your eyes
[Chorus]
You and me, you and me, just you and me, you and me
Just you and me, you and me, just you and me, you and me
You and me, you and me, just you and me, you and me
Just you and me, you and me, just you and me, me, me, me, me
[Verse 2]
Breathing loud
Everything we need is in the here and now
Home at last
Smiling as we leave our troubles in the past
Hypnotized
Love has never felt the way it does tonight
Safe from harm
I can feel a brighter future in your eyes
