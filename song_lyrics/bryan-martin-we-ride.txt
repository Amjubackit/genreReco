[Chorus]
Well, I've been known to write a few songs
Lovin' and leavin' and gettin' too stoned
Bottle and a pistol by my side
The devil's always along for the ride
[Verse 1]
We ride down to the creek by the water
I've been baptized by the preacher's daughter
Lucky for me, no, he never caught us, oh
Oh, we ride to the bar by the levee
'85 jacked-up, square-body Chevy
Blanket in the back when it gets hot and heavy, oh
Oh, we ridе
Pedal to the floorboard, she bеggin' for more
Sippin' on apple pie moonshine
And I'll be gone by the mornin' light
[Chorus]
Yeah, 'cause I've been known to write a few songs
Lovin' and leavin' and gettin' too stoned
Bottle and a pistol by my side
The devil's always along for the ride
[Verse 2]
We ride across state lines
Rubbin' two nickels just tryin' to make a dime
Hard to make a livin' while the gas is so high
Oh, we ride
Like a Harley on a two-lane, Palomino crossplane
Drop her down to four-wheel drive on a Friday night
Crackin' open a cold Bud Light
Oh, we ride
Pushin' through the hard love, lookin' for my give-a-fuck
Needle peggin' ninety-five, but that's alright
'Cause I'm runnin' every red light
