Yeah
And you say Chi city!

[Chorus: Chris Martin & 
Kanye West

I'm comin' home again
Do you think about me now and then? 
(Yeah)
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm comin' home again 
(Ow!)
-Min' home again
[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I met this girl when I was three years old
And what I loved most, she had so much soul
She said, "Excuse me, little homie, I know you don't know me, but
My name is Windy and I like to blow trees," and
From that point, I'd never blow her off
Niggas come from out of town, I like to show her off
They like to act tough, she like to tow 'em off
And make 'em straighten up their hat 'cause she know they soft
And when I grew up, she showed me how to go downtown
In the nighttime, her face lit up, so astoundin'
I told her in my heart is where she'll always be
She never messed with entertainers 'cause they always leave
She said, "It felt like they walked and drove on me"
Knew I was gang affiliated, got on TV and told on me
I guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me
She said, "Ye, keep makin' that, keep makin' that platinum and gold for me"
