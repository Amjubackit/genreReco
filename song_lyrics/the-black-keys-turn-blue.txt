[Verse 1]
In the dead of the night I start to lose control
But I still carry the weight like I've always done before
It gets so heavy at times, but what more can I do?
I gotta stay on track just like Pops told me to
[Chorus]
I really don't think you know
There could be Hell below, below
I really do hope you know
There could be Hell below, below
[Verse 2]
When the music is done and all the lights are low
I will remember the times when love would really glow
Like a dream I had before my world turned blue
When the light inside would only shine for you
[Chorus]
I really don't think you know
There could be Hell below, below
I really do hope you know
There could be Hell below, below
I really don't think you know
There could be Hell below, below
