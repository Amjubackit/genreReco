[Verse 1]
Called to the Devil and the Devil did come
I said to the Devil, "Devil, do you like drums?
Do you like cigarettes, dominoes, rum?"
He said, "Only sundown, Sundays, Christmas"
[Verse 2]
Some days end when I need a few friends
Now and again, I could never hope to keep them
Thought to give friends what I thought that they wanted
Never had they needed a good friend as I've been
[Verse 3]
Don't get me ventin' on friends who resent you
'Cause all you've ever done is been a noose to hang on to
They thought was a necklace and reckless
They fell into Hell where you both hang with nothing to do but
[Pre-Chorus]
Scratch, kick, let gravity win like
Fuck this, let gravity win like
You could leave it all behind
Even the Devil need time alone sometimes
[Chorus]
You could let it all go
You could let it all go
It's called "freefall"
It's called "freefall"
