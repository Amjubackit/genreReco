[Intro]
Listen in, 
it isn't when you're talking for your name's sake
Jesus, Mary Magdalene you are, are you okay?
Sitting by the well, Jill youâ€™re falling down the hill
Jack
 and everybody laughed
Don't you pray, don't you pray?
[Chorus]
To a Cocaine Jesus in a black four-seater
Got a man, don't need him, but you wait
Call me when you want, or just call me when you need it
If you only ever need it for the day
[Post-Chorus]
High won't hold, won't hold
And I have no more than all you left of me
I have, I have, I have no more than all you leave
[Verse 1]
High as hell, feeling fine, nothing bad but nothing kind
Not, not a word from me, at least nothing you would mind
In my head, in my head I get lonely sometimes
Feeling fly, coming down, never bad cause we're never out
You'll never call the cops again, I'll never call her mine
In my head, in my head I get lonely sometimes[Pre-Chorus]
When you find an old picture of us
And you clear away the dust
I hope you miss me sometimes
When you see a frame that reminds you of me
Do you remember the times
Oh the times that we believed?
[Chorus]
In a 
Cocaine Jesus
 in a black four-seater
Got a man, don't need him, but you wai-ai-ai-ait
Call me when you want, or just call me when you need it
If you only ever need it for the day
[Post-Chorus]
High won't hold, won't hold
And I have no more than all you left of me
I have, I have, I have no more than all you leave
[Verse 2]
And I'm nothing more than 
a page unwritten
 on the pavement
Blowing in the wind
You win a lot and lose just a little bit more
Than you gained in the end
But God I wish that I was better than I am
But no luck, no love, no Gospel I could understand
I'm nothing that you ever wanted to lean on, yeah
But even then[Pre-Chorus]
When you find an old picture of us
And you clear away the dust
I hope you miss me sometimes
When you see a frame that reminds you of me
Do you remember the times
Oh the times that we believed?
[Chorus]
In a Cocaine Jesus in a black four-seater
Got a man, don't need him, but you wait
Call me when you want, or just call me when you need it
If you only ever need it for the day
[Outro]
Today I'm just a page unwritten on the pavement
You needed 'til you left
But I'm more than a need or a thing you believe
Or a word that you leave unsaid
