[Intro: Kllo]
Hold tight, (You did good, $lick) hold tight
(It's a Smash!) I'm noticing the mine, I'm noticing the mine
Hold tight, hold tight, I'm noticing the mine, I'm noticing the mine
Hold tight, hold tight, I'm noticing the mine, I'm noticing the mine
Hold tight, hold tight, I'm noticing the mine, I'm noticing the mine
[Verse 1: Anthony Mars]
Yo, light that cigarette, I'm trippin'
Ash it on my bitches
Taking my dose, I never skip it
Still in my hood up pistol gripping
Still got a hundred blunts
Got that Bape up in my cup
Stay with a bitch in the cut
Who stay with my dick in her guts, yeah
Wetto the King of the Grey
Self park, I don't fuck with the valet, sheesh
Private jet, fuck a delay
Went to Paris and back in a day
Okay, no, I'm never okay
Bitch, stop asking
Came up and supported my family
Just for that thеy should give me a Grammy, uh
Running and ducking the slammеr, uh
Thinking 'bout cocking the hammer
The lights, the glitter, the glamour, uh
None of this shit even matter
None of this shit made me happy
Wound up in rehab instead of a casket
Locking me up and they had the rooms padded
Made a straitjacket my fashion
[Verse 2: Norman Atomic]
Ruby da Motherfucker Grim reaping, I'm undercover
Soul seeking, I found another bitch who's thinking that I'm her lover, no
Reason I keep on shrugging, blunt is cashed, let's keep 'em coming
Only weed keeps me from bugging and from seeking out more destruction
I'm a pro at self-doubt, but I doubt I'll ever know
That these bitches want me to fly 'em out just because I upped the glow
All these fuckboys wanna be me, but they keep it on the low
And talk shit about me and my cousin while we're thumbing through our dough
All this fame is such a curse, sometimes I wish I was a ghost
Watch me raise the fucking dead next time I'm on stage at a show
[Chorus: Anthony Mars, Norman Atomic, & Both]
Haunted, haunted, haunted, haunted
Haunted, haunted, haunted, haunted
Haunted, haunted, I can't escape my mind
It's like I'm doing time, all the time
Exhausted, lost it, just one little line
Have this talk with God all the time, yeah
Haunted, haunted, I can't escape my mind
It's like I'm doing time all the time
Exhausted, lost it, just one little line
Have this talk with God all the time, yeah
