[Intro: Kllo]
Hold tight,
 
(You did good, $lick)
 
hold tight
(It's a Smash!)
 
I'm noticing the mine, I'm noticing the mine
Hold tight, hold tight, I'm noticing the mine, I'm noticing the mine
Hold tight, hold tight, I'm noticing the mine, I'm noticing the mine
Hold tight, hold tight, I'm noticing the mine, I'm noticing the mine
[Verse 1: Anthony Mars]
Yo, light that cigarette, I'm trippin'
Ash it on my bitches
Taking my dose, I never skip it
Still in my hood up pistol gripping
Still got a hundred blunts
Got that Bape up in my cup
Stay with a bitch in the cut
Who stay with my dick in her guts, yeah
Wetto the King of the Grey
Self park, I don't fuck with the valet, sheesh
Private jet, fuck a delay
Went to Paris and back in a day
Okay, no, I'm never okay
Bitch, stop asking
Came up and supported my family
Just for that thеy should give me a Grammy, uh
Running and ducking the slammеr, uh
Thinking 'bout cocking the hammer
The lights, the glitter, the glamour, uh
None of this shit even matter
None of this shit made me happy
Wound up in rehab instead of a casket
Locking me up and they had the rooms padded
Made a straitjacket my fashion
