[Verse 1]
I wanna thank You, Heavenly Father
For shining Your light on me
You sent me someone who really loves me
And not just my body
He keeps me happy, so very happy, he loves me
I don't know how to be
It's been a long time since I had someone who loves me
I owe my thanks to Thee
[Refrain]
I know it could not happen without Your love
Ooh-ooh, without Your love, oh-oh-oh
[Verse 2]
It took a long time for it to happen
But I knew those nights I prayed
That You would send me someone who's real
And not the one for play
I kept the faith and didn't worry
My nights grew longer than the days
Until one day, it really happened
You sent true love my way
[Refrain]
I know it could not happen without You
Ooh-ooh, without You, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh[Bridge]
When the time is right, He'll fill your life with love and care
Believe, and He'll be there
Just do alright, don't do no wrong, and keep the faith
The Lord will shine His light your way
[Verse 3]
Thank You, Father
For shining Your light on me
I prayed a long time for it to happen
I did 'cause I believed
He makes me happy, so very happy
I don't know how to be
It's been a long time since I had someone who loves me
I owe my thanks to Thee
[Refrain]
I know it could not happen without You
Ooh-ooh, without You, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
[Outro]
(My nights were long and blue, until He sent me you)
I know it could not happen without Your love
Ooh-ooh, without Your love, oh-oh-oh, I
(My nights were long and blue, until He sent me you)
I know it could not happen without You
Ooh, without You, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
(My nights were long and blue, until He sent me you)
I know it could not have happen without You
Ooh-ooh, without You, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
(My nights were long and blue, until He sent me you)
I know it could not happen without You
