[Verse 1: Jonathan David Helser]
I believe in the blood of Jesus that washes white as snow
I believe in the power of the Gospel, still makes the broken whole
I believe that the curse of sin was broken when they rolled away that stone
I believe, I believe, I believe
[Chorus: Jonathan David & Melissa Helser]
As I bow before You, Lord
I will rise in confidence
I will see Your goodnеss more
In the land I'm living in
And no matter whеre I go
And no matter where I've been
I will see Your goodness, Lord
In the land I'm living in
[Verse 2: Jonathan David Helser, 
Jonathan David & Melissa Helser
]
I believe that the walls will start falling when we fall down on our knees
I believe that the lame will go walking, and the blind are gonna see
I believe that the Gates of Hell tremble when the church begins to sing
I believe, I believe, I believe
[Chorus: Jonathan David & Melissa Helser]
As I bow before You, Lord
I will rise in confidence
I will see Your goodness more
In the land I'm living in
And no matter where I go
And no matter where I've been
I will see Your goodness, Lord
In the land I'm living in[Bridge: Jonathan David & Melissa Helser,

Sing it to the daughters
Sing it to the sons
To every generation
Look at what the Lord has done
Sing it to the darkness
That the light has come
Sing it to the nations
Look at what the Lord has done
Oh, sing it to the daughters

To every generation
Look at what the Lord has done
Sing it to the darkness

Sing it to the nations
Look at what the Lord has done
Look at what the Lord has done

Mm, I can hear it
I can hear the sound of the promised land
Oh, I can hear it
It's the sound of redemption
I can feel it in my bones again
It's the sound of the promised land
Can you hear the mothers and fathers?
Can you hear the sons and daughters
Shouting the praise of God?
From one generation to the next
From one generation to the next
From one generation to the next
Somebody sing it tonight
From one generation to the next
We shout the praise of God
From one generation to the next
Let's sing it to the daughters

Look at what the Lord has done

Sing it to the sons
To every generation
Look at what the Lord has done
Sing it to the darkness
That the light has come
Sing it to the nations
Just look at what the Lord has done[Chorus: Jonathan David & Melissa Helser]
As I bow before You, Lord

We will see the goodness of the Lord
Just prophesy it
We will see the goodness of the Lord
Lift your voice in a shout tonight
We will see the goodness of the Lord
