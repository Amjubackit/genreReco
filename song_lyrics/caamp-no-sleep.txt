[Verse 1]
Oh, I saw a shooting star
Late last night
Yeah, she was pointing at the west coast
Beamin’ like a street light
Got my white denim jacket
And my bolo tie
Snuck past mom and dad and told my little brothers goodbye
[Guitar Interlude]
[Verse 2]
Oh, I hear a motor car
Coming up the coast
You know I’ve seen other cities but I like this one most
There’s a girl down the valley says that we can take it slow
Or we can push fast forward on it
Love, success, and rock and roll
[Chorus]
But it gets hard sometimes
Don’t I know it
I been up for a week
I can’t get no sleep
I lose my cool
[Guitar Interlude]
[Verse 3]
Oh, I saw a shooting star
Late last night
She’s like vanilla ice cream, baby
Milky white
I wanna love her all day
And all of the night
I wanna love her all day
For the rest of my life
[Chorus]
And it gets hard sometimes
Don’t I know it
I been up for a week
I can’t get no sleep
I lose my cool
I been up for a week
I can’t get no sleep
I lose my cool
[Outro]
Say what you mean babe
C’mon and tell it to me
Ooh
Ooh
Sh-sh-sh-shoobie doobie doowah, shoobie doobie doowah
Shoobie doobie doowah, shoobie doobie doowah
Shoobie doobie doowah, shoobie doobie doowah
Shoobie doobie doowah, yeah
