God has smiled on me
He has set me free, oh
God has smiled on me
He's been good to me, oh
God has smiled on me
He has set me free, yeah
God has smiled on me
He's been good to me
He is the source of my joy
He feels me with His love
Every, every, everything that I ever ever needed
See the Lord he sends it down from above, oh
God has smiled on me
He has set me free, yeah
God has smiled on me
He's been good to me
One day I was in my room and I wasn't feeling you
I said Father are you there
I'm feeling real scared
So I got down on my knees
As I begin to pray
Hoping that Lord heard
What I had to see I said
(God, God, God Please Help Me)
I started begging I said
(God, God, God Please Help Me)
Pleaded and I got on my knees
(God, God, God Please Smile On Me)
So as I begin to cry he said
I've never left your side I been right here all along
So you can dry your eyes
You seeketh me like I knew you would
Praising me like you know you could
That's when I realized that He's so good
My God is good, he's been good to me, oh
He's been good
(God is so good)
God is so good
(He is so good)
He is good (So good to me) to me
(God oh oh God)
He's been good
(Thank you for being so good)
God is so good
(God is so good)
He is good (Thank You Father) to me
(He's been, He's been, He's been so good)
He's been good
(He's been so good)
God is so good
'Cause he's been good to me
