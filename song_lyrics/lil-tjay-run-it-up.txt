[Intro: Lil Tjay]
I just like the sound of it
Grr, bow, bow, bow
Grr, bow
[Verse 1: Lil Tjay & 
Offset
]
Y'all do not know me, I shoot like I'm Kobe
That boy really tough on his doley though
I keep a Drac', ain't no OVO
I ain't for nothin', just check my portfolio
Really come from a block where they bang, bang
Protect that Glock, oh, this Glock ain't no goalie, bro
Say you 'bout what you claimin', then show me though
One in the head, you gon' die tryna toe-to-toe
Trench kid
, no fucks, gotta run it up
If you thinkin' I'ma lose, then you dumb as fuck
Pop out, drippin' diamonds, ooh, Bentley butter cup
Youngest out my city, keep it smooth just to sum it up
No security, you see me, but that Glock spit
Youngest nigga doin' it, that's why I pop shit
VVS's drippin' water, it's like a mosh pit
Really not shit, but I'm movin' like I'm hot shit
Legal money comin' in, I started off robbin'
True to evеrything I did, there's really no flagin'
All my shit been goin' up, lil' nigga, no dodgin'
And I'ma keep on comin' with thе heat, I'm hoggin'
Trench kid, glitter on the piece, stop sobbin'
Why them niggas hatin'? It defeats my noggin
I
f that ain't really your beef, stop sidin'
Say you tryna run in these streets, stop hidin', huh
Run it up, run it up, run it up (
Run it up

[Verse 3: Moneybagg Yo]
I been runnin' that money up, puttin' on (Go)
Ain't no end to this trend, it's a marathon (Go)
Different breed, I might bust down a herringbone (Look)
Board a flight with them racks in my carry-on
Talkin' 'bout money, you know who to call (Bagg)
It look like a riot, I fucked up the mall (Woah)
She diggin', have me and my whole circle, boss (Gang)
Gave me some top through my Ethika draws (Uh)
Earrings one-fifty, I'm thuggin', I'm hood
I lock the screw back and put erasers on 'em (Ghetto)
Wide body Daytona, bending the corner
Them hitters ain't renters, the tag Arizona
Ain't get no diploma (Nope)
Shot dice for the J's, the freshest dude in the schoolhouse
 (Turn up for)
You ain't gangster, you went, took the smooth route (Been a ho)
Ran it up, now my pockets look too stout
Never enough, man, I gotta go get some more
Sold enough gas to go buy me a Texaco (Good petrol)
Now I'm on the charts, I'm runnin' up streams
My niggas still got what you need though (Go)
Built my name from the ground, I ain't have no help (No)
It's just me versus me, beefin' with myself (Bagg)
It was time I woke 'em up, they overslept (Get up)
Run it up, run it up, still ain't out of breath (Go)[Chorus: Lil Tjay]
Run it up, run it up, run it up, run it up
Run it up, run it up, run it up (Ooh)
Run it up, run it up, run it up, run it up
Run it up, run it up, run it up
I just stack up that money, I run it up
Give a fuck 'bout who love me, I run it up
What the fuck they gon' tell me? My money up
Run it up, run it up, run it up, run it up
