Winter spring summer fall
Trouble keep coming out of nowhere
Doesn't have respect at all
Somebody going through it somewhere
Wonderin' what you're gunna do
Wonderin' if you're gunna make it
Wonderin' how long it will take
And will you ever get through
Can't see the light of day nowhere
The enemy tryna make you feel like pain will be always
But you know like I know that trouble will never last always
So hold ya head up high
'Cause God is on your side
And He loves you
And He cares
He's so faithful
Never failsDoesn't matter what the problem

Trust me He got all power

Seem like everybody else
Doin' so much better than you
They just got it all together
And you just tryna get through you
Don't see no results
Not laughing it's not a joke
'Cause I'm telling you if God don't come through with something
I must just...I don't know
The enemy tryna make you feel like this will be always
But you know deep down that you gotta come out of this someday
So hold ya head up high
God is on your side
Hold ya head up high
