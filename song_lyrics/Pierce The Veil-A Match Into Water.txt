[Intro]
Let's go!
[Verse 1]
I kissed the scars on her skin
I still think you're beautiful
And I don't ever want to lose my best friend
I screamed out, "God, you vulture
Bring her back or take me with her"
Tear it down, break the barricade!
I want to see what sound it makes
I hate this flavor with a passion
And I fucking hate the aftertaste!
How does it feel? How does it feel?
Well, it feels like I'm on fire
Wake up, I know you can hear me
[Chorus]
Make me a promise here tonight, love like a tidal wave
Dreamless in early graves, I never want it to be this way
The chemicals will bring you home again
This is it, when it's done, we can say that
When it's sudden death, we fight back
[Verse 2]
(Oh, yeah, this was just as I suspected)
Pretend like I don't entice you
I've seen you circling the sky above my head
You traitor!
 I will never be taken for granted again
(Keep digging holes in the desert!)
Say a prayer for you, I know that you're in pain
But if we die at the same time, does it still scare you?
