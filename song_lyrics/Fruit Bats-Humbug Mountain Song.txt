[Verse 1]
The first time I realized I was living in this world
I was probably looking at the sky
And forgive me, but I don't know if I remember enough to say
What the air was really like that day
May've been clouds, or sun
I don't recall, I was young
[Verse 2]
And the next time I realized that I was breathing and alive
Was the first time that I saw your face
I wanted you, but I don't know if I was brave enough to say
How the sight of you messed up my mind
And I got scared, right away
Then OK, right away
[Verse 3]
The next thing I knew the stars were eyes up in the night
And the ocean breathing heavy like a beast
I held you, but I don't know
if I was strong enough to say
How the way it felt messed up my mind
May've been clouds, or sun
I don't recall, I was young
[Outro]
May've been clouds, or sun
I don't recall, I was young
May've been clouds, or sun
I don't recall, I was young
May've been clouds, or sun
I don't recall, I was young
