[Verse 1]
And it's been awhile
Since I could hold my head up high
And it's been awhile
Since I first saw you
And it's been awhile
Since I could stand on my own two feet again
And it's been awhile
Since I could call you
[Chorus]
And everything I can't remember
As fucked up as it all may seem
The consequences that are rendered
I've stretched myself beyond my means
[Verse 2]
And it's been awhile
Since I could say that I wasn't addicted
And it's been awhile
Since I can say I love myself as well
And it's been awhile
Since I've gone and fucked things up, just like I always do
And it's been awhile
But all that shit seems to disappear when I'm with you
