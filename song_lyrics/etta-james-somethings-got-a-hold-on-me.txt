[Intro]
Oh-oh, sometimes I get a good feeling, yeah (Yeah)
I get a feeling that I never, never, never
Never had before, no, no (Yeah)
I just wanna tell you right now that I (Ooh)
I believe, I really do believe that
[Chorus]
Something’s got a hold on me, yeah
(Oh, it must be love)
Oh, something’s got a hold on me right now, child
(Oh, it must be love)
Let me tell you now
[Verse 1]
I got a feeling, I feel so strange
Everything about me seems to have changed
Step by step, I got a brand new walk
I even sound sweeter when I talk
[Pre-Chorus]
I said, oh (oh), oh (oh), oh (oh), oh (oh)
Hey, oh, oh, it must be love
(You know it must be love)
Let me tell you now
