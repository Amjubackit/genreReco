[Verse 1]
Open, blurry, nurture, loving
Crawling, walking, fleeting, glory
Welcome brother, stranger, bloody
Ally, teacher, recess, buddy
Secret, toothless, fairy, pillow
Money, kissing, nervous, hero
Warmly ordinary (this daytime TV satisfies)
Extra ordinary (these hand-me-downs worn in so nice)
[Chorus]
As it may, as it may, as it may, as it may
As it may, as it may, as it may, as it may
Days are fine and come on time
But years leave with nothing to find
[Verse 2]
Changes, hormones, high school, threesome
Roll call, study, license, freedom
Novice, flirting, first time, lover
Party, fighting, wasted, summer
Questions, doubtful, wedding, family
Happy ever after, dead end
Daily iteration (the bestest part of waking up)
Mundane ideation (this dark roast got me so fucked up)
