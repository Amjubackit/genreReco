[Verse 1]
I want you
I hold one card
That I can't use
But I want you
[Pre-Chorus]
You're coming back
And it's the end of the world
We're starting over
And I love you, darling
And I am done, dear
[Chorus]
You're in the house
And I am here in the car
I just need a quiet place
Where I can scream
How I love you
[Verse 2]
I found you
I found the door
But when I stepped through
There was no floor
[Pre-Chorus]
You're coming back
And it's the end of the world
We're starting over
And I love you, darling
And I am done, dear
[Chorus]
You're in the house
And I am here in the car
I just need a quiet place
Where I can scream
How I love you
[Outro]
I want you
I want you
