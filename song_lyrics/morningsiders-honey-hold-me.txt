[Verse 1]
Honey, hold me close
Hold me with both arms
Tell me it's alright
Sing me that song I love
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Honey, I'm a mess
Its only been three days
Trying not to stress
I'm singing that song we love
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
[Chorus]
Gonna hold my breath until you're here
‘Cause I can't breathe without you dear
Gonna hold my breath until you're here
‘Cause I can't breathe without you
[Verse 2]
Honey please come home
I can't sleep through the night
I don't do well alone
Singing that song we love
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
[Chorus]
Gonna hold my breath until you're here
‘Cause I can't breathe without you dear
Gonna hold my breath until you're here
‘Cause I can't breathe without you
[Instrumental]
[Chorus]
Gonna hold my breath until you're here
‘Cause I can't breathe without you dear
Gonna hold my breath until you're here
‘Cause I can't breathe without you
Gonna hold my breath until you're here
‘Cause I can't breathe without you dear
Gonna hold my breath until you're here
‘Cause I can't breath without you
