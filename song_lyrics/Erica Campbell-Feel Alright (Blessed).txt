[Verse 1]
I woke up this mornin' with dancin' in my feet
I'm singin' Hallelujah, thank You for my heartbeat
I'm givin' You the glory, 'cause You been good to me
Now I ain't gon' be selfish, can't keep it just for me
And ooh, I want the world to know
And ooh, I'm livin' life to show
I'm not always as happy, like every single day
But that is not my problem, at least not today
