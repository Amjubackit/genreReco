[Verse 1]
Lord of the mountains and sea
You are treading a path set for me
God of the seasons and sky
You have always been holding my life
[Chorus]
And Lord, You are the shepherd of my soul
So I lay down my plans, I give up my rights
And let You take control of this surrendered life
[Verse 2]
So I put my trust in the one
Who created the stars and the sun
You are eternally kind
Always faithful and endlessly wise
[Bridge]
You comfort, You sustain
In shaking You remain
Unmoved and unafraid
Forever and always
You lead me by still waters
Lead me through the valleys
Lead me in Your wisdom
Shepherd of my soul[Chorus 2]
Through valleys of shadow and death I am not afraid
By my Father’s breath every star in the sky was made
And who can I fear when You’re standing right here by my side?
Always leading, protecting and guarding my left and my right
[Chorus 3]
Father You make all things new
Great God of creation
Father You will always be my rock and salvation
