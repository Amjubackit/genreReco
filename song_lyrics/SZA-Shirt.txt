[Verse 1]
Kiss me dangerous
Been so lost without you all around me
Get anxious
Lead me, don't look back
It's all about you
[Pre-Chorus]
In the dark right now
Feelin' lost, but I like it
Comfort in my sins and all about me
All I got right now
Feel the taste of resentment
Simmer in my skin, it's all about
[Chorus]
Bloodstain on my shirt
New bitch on my nerves
Old nigga got curved
Goin' back on my word
Damn, bitch, you so thirsty
Still don't know my worth
Still stressin' perfection
Let you all in my mental
Got me lookin' too desperate
Damn (You ain't deserve)
