[Intro]
Come with me now
Come with me now
Whoa, come with me now
I'm gonna take you down
Whoa, come with me now
I'm gonna show you how
Whoa, come with me now
I'm gonna take you down
Whoa, come with me now
I'm gonna show you how
[Verse 1]
Afraid to lose control
And caught up in this world
I've wasted time, I've wasted breath
I think I've thought myself to death
I was born without this fear
Now only this seems clear
I need to move, I need to fight
I need to lose myself tonight
[Chorus]
Whoa, come with me now
I'm gonna take you down
Whoa, come with me now
I'm gonna show you how
