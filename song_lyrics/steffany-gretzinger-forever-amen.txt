[Verse]
Let me hear the sound of Your voice and I will leave it all behind
Let me hear the sound of Your voice and I'll come running
There’s something in the sound of Your voice that speaks to every part of me
When I hear the sound of Your voice, I'm alive
[Chorus]
I was made to love You, it's all I really know for sure
All I am is wrapped up in You, the center of my world
And I was made to love You, from my beginning to my end
And You’ll be my forever, my forever amen
[Verse]
Let me hear the sound of Your voice and I will leave it all behind
Let me hear the sound of Your voice and I'll come running
There's something in the sound of Your voice that speaks to every part of me
And when I hear the sound of Your voice, I'm alive
[Chorus]
Oh, I was made to love You, it's all I really know for sure
All I am is wrapped up in You, the center of my world
And I was made to love You, from my beginning to my end
And You'll be my forever, my forever amen
[Outro]
Amen, amen
Amen, amen, amen
Amen, amen
Amen, amen, amen
Amen, amen
Amen, amen, amen
Amen, amen
Amen, amen, amen
