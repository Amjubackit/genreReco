[Verse 1]
When it comes crashing down and it hurts inside
You gotta take a stand it don't help to hide
If you hurt my friends, then you hurt my pride
I gotta be a man
I can't let it slide
[Chorus]
I am a real American
Fight for the rights of every man
I am a real American
Fight for what's right
Fight for your life
[Verse 2]
I feel strong about right and wrong
And I don't take trouble for very long
I've got something deep inside of me
Courage is the thing that keeps us free
[Chorus x2]
[Bridge]
If you hurt my friends then you hurt my pride
I gotta be a man I can't let it slide
[Chorus x4]
