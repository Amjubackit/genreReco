[Intro : Guitar]
[Verse 1]
What can I say
I’m nothing to myself
And tired of starting up my day
But in the morning I could meet you
[Chorus]
I’m not what I thought
I would be without you
I’m not really sure why
I slept in my shoes
I’m nothing at all
I’m nothing at all
[Pre-Chorus]
Lucky for you
I’m nothing without
The thought of starting all my days
With the mornings when I see you
I’m bored of staring at my face
Every morning when I need you
Every morning when I need you
[Outro]
I’m not what I thought
I would be without you
I’m not really sure why I do what I do
I’m nothing at all
I’m nothing at all
