[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]
I already feel like doing it again, honey
'Cause once you know, then you know
And you don't wanna go home
Back to where it is that you come from
[Refrain: Childish Gambino]
I just want to stay high with you
[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
'Cause where I come from
Everybody frowns and walks around with
That old ugly thing on their face
'Cause where I come from
We work hard and we grind and we hustle all day, don't we?
(Yes, we do)
There comes a time, there comes a time
At night, where we come play
And there'll be smiling, laughing, jumping, clapping
Yell and holler, just feel, just feel great, yeah yes
[Refrain: Childish Gambino]
I just want to stay high with you
With you
[Verse 3: Childish Gambino]
So, don't question my state of mind
I'm doing wonderful, just fine, thank you
(Thank you)
Everything is everything and everything is beautiful
(How did you get like that to?)
See, all I do (is keep it cool) and don't worry 'bout what everyone is doing, no
I already feel like doing it again, honey[Outro: Childish Gambino]
I just wanna stay high
I just wanna stay high
I just wanna stay high with you (Ooh darling), with you
With you, with you
With you (Damn)
With you (Damn)
With you
With you
