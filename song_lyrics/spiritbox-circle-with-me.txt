[Intro]
Feel the weight of a martyr
It could all be yours
Cut down the altar
[Verse 1]
Visionaire and deepest fake
Dirty gold, the colours change
Hands are frozen, feel no pain
I just wanna hold the flame
[Pre-Chorus]
Negative feedback loop
I'm spinning out of control
The sickly sweetness is crushing me
But I wanna know
If there's no heat when I escalate, the fire is cold
They echo, "This could all be yours"
[Chorus]
Feel the weight of a martyr
It could all be yours if you echo birds of prey
Traitor cut down the altar
It could all be yours
Vultures circling the flame[Verse 2]
Nothing sacred, nothing lost
When birds of prey invade my thoughts
They promise I will feel the pain
Not strong enough to hold the flame
[Pre-Chorus]
Negative feedback loop
I'm spinning out of control
The sickly sweetness is crushing me
But I wanna know
If there's no heat when I escalate, the fire is cold
They echo, "This could all be yours"
[Chorus]
Feel the weight of a martyr
It could all be yours if you echo birds of prey
Traitor cut down the altar
It could all be yours
Vultures circling the flame
[Bridge]
I held the power of a dying sun
I climb the altar and I claim my place as God
Circle with me
Circle with me
This could all be yours[Chorus]
Feel the weight of a martyr
It could all be yours if you echo birds of prey
Traitor cut down the altar
It could all be yours
Vultures circling the flame
[Post-Chorus]
Feel the weight of a martyr
A traitor watching me as
Birds of prey never falter
This could all be yours
This could all be yours
[Outro]
Circle with me
