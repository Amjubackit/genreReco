[Verse 1]
She was storming through the house that day
And I could tell she was leaving
And I thought, aw, she'll be back
Till she turned around and pointed at the wall and said
[Verse 2]
That picture from our honeymoon
That night in Frisco Bay
Just give it away
She said, give it away
And that big four-poster king-size bed
Where so much love was made
Just give it away
She said, just give it away
[Chorus]
Just give it away
There ain't nothing in this house worth fighting over
Oh, and we're both tired of fighting anyway
Just give it away
[Bridge]
So I tried to move on
But I found that each woman I held
Just reminded me of that day
Hmm
[Verse 3]
When that front door swung wide open
She flung her diamond ring
Said, give it away
Just give it away
And I said, now, honey, don't you even want
Your half of everything
She said, give it away
Just give it away
[Chorus]
Just give it away
There ain't nothing in this house worth fighting over
Oh, and we're both tired of fighting anyway
Just give it away
[Instrumental interlude]
[Verse 4]
So I'm still right here where she left me
Along with all the other things
She don't care about anymore
Mmm, like that picture from our honeymoon
That night in Frisco Bay
She said, give it away
Well, I can't give it away
And that big four-poster king-size bed
Where all our love was made
She said, give it away
Well, I can't give it away
[Outro]
I've got a furnished house, a diamond ring
And a lonely broken heart
Full of love and I can't even give it away
