[Verse 1]
When I was younger and I didn’t know better
Living with these wolves, hurting for pleasure
Some kind of angel took me out of the jungle
From your blue nights
Into sunlight
[Pre-Chorus]
I sleep better at night without you around
Sometimes I still awake from you calling out
[Chorus]
It’s too late to hold me
Too late to call me, too
You’re saying, "If only
I could get over you"
Too late to know me
I’m going without you
You’re saying, "If only
If only"
[Verse 2]
I said I’d meet you off the freeway, you’re lonely
You still don’t understand, a woman is holy
Your fake apologies would work on the old me
I get into my car
Leave you where you are
