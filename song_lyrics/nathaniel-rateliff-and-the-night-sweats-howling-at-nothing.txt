[Verse 1]
Some are waving it around
Someone carried me home
One was never noticed sleeping on the floor
But I know we were there
[Verse 2]
Some were playing around
Some were dipping so low
Never seemed to matter as the night slipped away
Cause there was soul in the air
[Chorus]
We were howling at the moon
We were shaking our hips
Danced until we flat out falling into bed
But I won’t let you go
[Verse 3]
So let me in or let me down
Let me lay here so slow
Baby just keep holding got to move our feet
Cause you know it ain’t end
[Verse 4]
Step it in or step it out
Cut it all in and run
Kept on 'til it mattered baby I don’t even see
But I know we were there[Chorus]
We were howling at the moon
We were shaking our hips
And we danced until we flat out falling into bed
But I won’t let you go
We were howling at the moon
We were shaking our hips
And we danced until we flat out falling into bed
And I won’t let you go
Now we danced until we flat out falling into bed
And I won’t let you go
