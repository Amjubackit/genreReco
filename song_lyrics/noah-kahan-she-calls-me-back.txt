[Chorus]
Oh-oh, oh-oh
There was Heaven in your eyes
I was not baptized
Everything's alright when
She calls me back, she calls me back
Lost for a long time
Two parallel lines
Everything’s alright when
She calls me back, she calls me back (Yeah)
[Verse 1]
Look at me and don't you lie
I could be your sacrifice
But don't you hold your head up high
For bullshit, I do not have time
I can be an old tattoo
To remind me when I get bad news
And I do not exist to die
But live to die while saving you
[Pre-Chorus]
Does it bite at your edges?
Do you lie awake restless?
Why am I so obsessive?
Hanging onto every sentence
This town’s the same as you left it
Your page was blank, but I read it
I still dial 822-993-167
