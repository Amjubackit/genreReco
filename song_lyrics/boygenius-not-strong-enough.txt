[Verse 1: Bridgers]
Black hole opened in the kitchen
Every clock's a different
 time
It would only take the energy to fix it
I don't know why I am
[Chorus: Bridgers, 
Bridgers
 & Baker
]
The way 
I am
Not strong enough to be your man
I tried, I can't
Stop staring at the ceiling fan and
Spinning out
 about things that haven't happened
Breathing in and out
[Verse 2: Baker]
Drag racing through the canyon
Singing "Boys Don't Cry"
Do you see us getting scraped up off the pavement?
I don't know why I am
[Chorus: Baker, 
Baker & Bridgers
]
The way 
I am
Not strong enough to be your man
I lied, I am
Just lowering your expectations
Half a mind that keeps the other second guessing
Close my ey–µs and count
