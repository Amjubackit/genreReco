[Verse 1]
Forever together
Through fire and rain, I'll wait for you
I'll never surrender
When you ask me to
[Refrain]
Exile from your garden
Talking sweet little lies in the space of a thousand truths
A dark river is rising
So I'll hold on to
A never ending moment with you
[Verse 2]
No one knows me better
Nobody can hurt me like you do
And all the ties have been severed
So you cut me lose
[Refrain]
Torn up from the inside
In a house on a hill where my soul was bred for you
And now I brace for the landslide
So I'll hold on to
A never ending moment with you
[Instrumental Break]
[Bridge]
The ties have been severed
So I'm holding on to
A never ending moment with you
Never ending moment
Never ending moment
Never ending moment
Moment
[Outro]
A never ending moment
Never ending moment
Never ending moment
Never ending moment
