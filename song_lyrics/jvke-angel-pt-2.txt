[Chorus: JVKE & 
Jimin
]
Angel, don't fly so close to me
I'll pull you down eventually
You don't wanna lose those wings
People like me break beautiful things
Angel, don't fly so close to me
I'm what you want, not what you need
You don't wanna lose those wings
People like me break beautiful things
[Verse 1: JVKE]
Another day, another week
Another night I didn't sleep
I thought together we'd be better
Guess I should've known better
Seein' things I can't unsee
I said things I can't repeat
Forget whatever you rеmember
No, I don't need no conversation
[Pre-Chorus: JVKE]
Onе more moment wasted
We're movin' on
Don't make this harder than it has to be
If you're really my[Chorus: Muni Long, 
Muni Long & Jimin

Angel, don't fly so close to me
I'll pull you down eventually
You don't wanna lose those wings
People like me break beautiful things
Angel, don't fly so close to me
I'm what you want, not what you need
You don't wanna lose those wings
People like me break beautiful things
[Verse 2: Charlie Puth]
So be careful when you're on your way, on your way out
That you won't find your way back in the dark, dark
And I'll, I'll pray for signs you're doin' okay out there
And that you're happy wherever you are, you are
We weren't meant to last forever
Someone else will love you better
Baby, now, it's time to let me go
[Pre-Chorus: JVKE, 
JVKE & Muni Long

Don't you know, don't you know
Don't you know, don't you know?
I don't wanna let you down
No, I'll never be perfect
Never wanna see you hurtin'
You should go, you should go
Get away fast, a hundred on the dash now
Wish it didn't have to be this way[Chorus: JVKE, Jimin & Muni Long]
My angel, don't fly so close to me
I'll pull you down eventually
You don't wanna lose those wings
People like me break beautiful things
Angel, don't fly so close to me
I'm what you want, not what you need
You don't wanna lose those wings
People like me break beautiful things
