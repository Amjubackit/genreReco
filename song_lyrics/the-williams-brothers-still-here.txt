Heartaches,I've had my shares of hearaches, but I'm still here
Trouble, I've seen my share of troubles, but I'm still here
Bruises, I've taken my lumps and bruises, but I'm still here
Loneliness, I've had my share of loneliness, but I'm still here
Chorus
Through it all I've made it through
Another day's journey
God kept me here
I've made it through
Another day's journey
God kept me here
Lied on, many times I've been lied on, but I'm still here
Burdens, I had to bare so many burdens, but I'm still here
Dark days, I've had my share of dark days, but I'm still here
Disappointments, I've had so many dissappointments, but I'm still here
Chorus
It's by the grace of God, that I'm still here today
He was always there, no matter what came my way
I felt the presence of him, in my time of need
Standing right there, just to sill my faithChorus
I made it (I made it)
I made it (yes, I made it)
I'm still here(I'm still here)
A lot of folks say that I wouldn't be here tonight, but I made it (I made it)
By the grace of God, Yall (yes,I made it)
I'm still here (I'm still here)
I have to lay awake in the midnight hour, sometimes tossing & turning (I made it)
All night long (yes, I mad it)
Have anyone had to lay awake all night long sometimes (I'm still here)
Tears in your eyes wandering what the next day was gonna bring (I made it)
God has kept arms around you, yes he did (yes, I made it)
You made through the trials (I'm still here)
Come on let me see those hands in the air
I made it, I made it (I made it)
I made it, I made it (yes,I made it)
I made it, I made it(I'm still here)
Through it all (through it all...I'm still here
