[Verse 1]
You are mine again
Every mistake that you made
All the people that you saved took a little piece of you with them
You are mine again
And I'm so damn glad you're here
Talkin' strong, sober, and clear like you couldn't back then
[Verse 2]
How many sad songs it take to get your stubborn ass awake?
What finally got you risin' from your bed?
Was it the sunset on her cheeks leadin' down to a delicate collar bone
Or the judgement of your mind when you're alone?
[Chorus]
Mine again, fondest friend where the hell you been?
I've been strugglin' to get back to you
And if you fight all night I'm sure you'll gain the guts to try
To get past the things that you've been through
'Cause no one plays it cool quite the way you do
[Verse 3]
Are those tires you got still turnin'?
Is that spirit you had still burnin'?
Do you still talk that shit the way you did before?
All the women and the wages and the wars that I've been wagin'
I just don't feel like fightin' anymore[Chorus]
Mine again, fondest friend where the hell you been?
I've been strugglin' to get back to you
And if you fight all night I'm sure you'll gain the guts to try
To get past the things that you've been through
'Cause no one plays it cool quite the way you do
[Bridge]
Mine again
So head back home and be who you know you can
Mine again
So don't be so cruel and play God with all his plans
[Outro]
Well I am mine again
Every mistake that I made
And I ain't ashamed to say who the hell I am
'Cause I am mine again
And I'm so damn glad I'm here
Talking strong, sober, and clear like I couldn't back then
