[Part I: Touch of Heaven]
[Verse 1]
How I live for the moments
Where I'm still in Your presence
Where all the noise dies down
Lord, speak to me now
You have all my attention
I will linger and listen
I can't miss a thing
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause Lord, I know my heart wants more of You
My heart wants something new
So I surrender all
[Chorus]
All I want is to live within Your love
Be undone by who You are
My desire is to know You deeper
And Lord, I will open up again
Throw my fears into the wind
I am desperate for a touch of heaven
[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
[Verse 2]
You're the fire in the morning
You're the cool in the evening
The breath in my soul
You're the life in my bones
There is no hesitation
In Your love and affection
It's the sweetest of all
[Pre-Chorus]
And Lord, I know my heart, it wants more of You
My heart wants something new
So I surrender all
[Chorus]
And all I want is to live within Your love
Be undone by who You are
My desire is to know You deeper
And Lord, I will open up again
Throw my fears into the wind
I am desperate for a touch of heaven
[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
[Bridge]
I open up my heart to You
I open up my heart to You now
So do what only You can
Jesus, have Your way in me now
I open up my heart to You, fully open
I open up my heart to You now
So do what only You can, hey
Jesus, have Your way in me now
I open up my heart to You
I open up my heart to You now
So do what only You can
Jesus, have Your way in me now
[Interlude]
Come have Your way
Come have Your way, oh
Oh, You're all we want
You're all we want
[Bridge]
I open up my heart to You
I open up my heart to You now
So do what only You can
Oh Jesus, have Your way in me now
[Chorus]
All I want is to live within Your love
Be undone by who You are
My desire is to know You deeper
And Lord, I will open up again
Throw my fears into the wind
I am desperate for a touch of heaven
[Interlude]
Just one touch
Just one glimpse of Your face
I wanna be undone in Your presence
I wanna be undone in Your presence
Overwhelmed by Your love for me
We open up
We open up, we give everything tonight
Oh, we make an altar of our praise
We make an altar of our praise
Come on, let it cost you
Oh-oh, any price
We will make an altar tonight, yeah
[Part II: Alabaster Heart]
[Bridge]
Oh all my love, all my love, all my love
You can have it all
All my love, all my love, all my love (I just need more of You)
All my heart and all my soul, all I own
You can have it all
All my heart and all my soul, all I own (Oh, we open up tonight)
You can have it all
All my love, all my love, all my love
You can have it all
All my love, all my love, all my love
You will have it all
All my heart and all my soul, all I own
You can have it all
All my heart and all my soul, all I own
You can have it all (Sing it again)
All my love, all my love, all my love
You will have it all
All my love, all my love, all my love (Anything for a touch)
You can have it all
Yeah all my heart and all my soul, all I own
You can have it all
All my heart, all my soul, all I own
You can have it all
[Interlude]
Oh, You can have it all
You can have it all
All we want is You
All we want is You
[Outro]
Oh, all I want is to live within Your love
Be undone by who You are
My desire is to know You deeper
And Lord, I will open up again
Throw my fears into the wind
I am desperate for a touch of heaven
I will open up again
Pour myself out again
