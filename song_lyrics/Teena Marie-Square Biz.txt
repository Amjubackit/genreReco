[Intro: Teena Marie]
Hee...
Everybody get up
[Verse 1: Teena Marie]
Flashback, who's that dancing to the latest?
Suave de bone, the greatest, ooh, he sure is moving me
That's what I said, though you didn't know yet
All of it was kismet, soon to be made history
[Pre-Chorus: Teena Marie]
So don't you have no doubt, I'm gonna spell it out
I'll hip you to the Tee that is
I got the best, the most, baby, from coast to coast
And I don't wanna boast, but I love you Square Biz
[Chorus: Teena Marie]
I'm talking Square Biz to you, baby
Square, Square Biz
I'm talking love that is
Square, Square Biz
I'm talking Square Biz to you, baby
Square, Square Biz
I'm talking love
That is, that is, that is Square Biz
