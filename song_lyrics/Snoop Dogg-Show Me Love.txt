[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Ya I don't know why you treat me so motherfuckin bad
You ain't gonna realize whats you got till its gone, thats real
You gets no lovin, babe
[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Girl you know I got you livin plush in the cut
And every time I wanna dig you out
You tell me "don't rush"
Money stashin, you got me sneakin
And we all alone in the zone, I be tweakin
I almost got caught, my game is leaking
I had to stay at my daddy's house, on the couch last weekend
It's written on my face, and I can't even hide it
So I decided, to ride it
Roses are red, and Violets are blue
Girl you got a nigga hooked, when you do whatcha do when ya do
And now ya want a Benz for ya birthday
And I been waitin to hit that ass since the first day
I'm buyin you gifts, draping you out, with gold
I'm showin you love, you's above any other hoe
Tattoo wit my name on your tits
And everytime I dip, I make sure to kick some chips
Now bitch trip
[Chorus: Charlie Wilson & Snoop Dogg]
You don't show me some love
Show me love, for real, you gets no love, yeah
You gets no loving, babe
You gets no love, you ain't gonna miss it 'til it's gone
You don't show me some love
Show me love, for real, you gets no love, yeah
You gets no loving, babe
You gets no love, you ain't gonna miss it 'til it's gone
