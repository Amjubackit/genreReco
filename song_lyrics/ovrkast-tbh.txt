To be honest
I don't know how I'm feeling inside
I don't know if I get it or why
I don't know if I'm really the guy
I just owe all my feelings a break
I just know all my feelings could cry
I just know that I really could die if I put all my faith in a digital mind
I could post that I'm dead and niggas would know, but they wouldn't feel pity inside
Or maybe they would I'm tripping, no, wait I'm good I'm tripping
I'ma stay for the food then Iâ€™m dipping
I'ma talk to yo granny and leave
I was mixing the proof in the pudding and panicking how did I manage to be, here
But I gotta go get it
But I gotta get it aye
But I gotta go feel it
But I gotta go get it, I guess
