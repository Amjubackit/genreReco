[Verse 1]
Anything is what she is
Anywhere is where she's from
Anything is what she'll be
Anything as long as it's mine
And the door it opened a way back in
Or is it way back out?
[Verse 2]
Any place is where she'll be
Any place she'll see you from
Lies and secrets become your world
Anytime, anywhere, she takes me away
And death climbs up the steps one by one
To give you the rose that's been burned by her son
[Chorus]
Point me to the sky above
I can't get there on my own
Walk me to the graveyard
Dig up her bones
[Verse 3]
I have seen the demon's face
I have heard of her death place
I fall down on my knees
And praised the ground
Horrible things that took her away
And death climbs up the steps one by one
To give you the rose that's been burned by her son
[Chorus]
Point me to the sky above
I can't get there on my own
Walk me to the graveyard
Dig up her bones
Point me to the sky above
I can't get there on my own
Walk me to the graveyard
Dig up her bones
Bones
