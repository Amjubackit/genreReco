(Intro)
Hmm.. hmm.. hmm...
Real simple prayer
(Chorus)
All I need is a touch from you
No one else can do the things you do
Take the wrong in my life and make it right
All I need is a touch from you
All I need is a touch from you
(Verse 1)
Lord I'm standing in the need of prayer
When I call Lord I know you're there
Reach your hand down from heaven
And pull me through
Because, all I need is a single touch
A touch from the master, Oh God
All, all I ever needed is a touch from you
(Verse 2)
If you touch me, I'll change from lose to win
If you touch me, I shall live again
You'll take the wrong and make it right
All I need is a touch from you
All I need is a touch
