(Intro)
Hmm.. hmm.. hmm...
Real simple prayer
(Chorus)
All I need is a touch from you
No one else can do the things you do
Take the wrong in my life and make it right
All I need is a touch from you
All I need is a touch from you
(Verse 1)
Lord I'm standing in the need of prayer
When I call Lord I know you're there
Reach your hand down from heaven
And pull me through
Because, all I need is a single touch
A touch from the master, Oh God
All, all I ever needed is a touch from you
(Verse 2)
If you touch me, I'll change from lose to win
If you touch me, I shall live again
You'll take the wrong and make it right
All I need is a touch from you
All I need is a touch
(Vamp)
(That's why I need your touch tonight)
Touch me (Your unchanging hand)
Touch me (That will not waver)
Touch me (Even when I'm worked, weak)
All I need is a touch (and worn out and filled with doubts about tomorrow)
Touch me (Cause I felt this pain yesterday)
Touch me (Cause I made so many mistakes, I mean I stumbled and fell)
Touch me (And I did not think)
All I need is a touch (I could ever be made over, cleaned up)
Touch me (But somehow I believe tonight)
Touch me (That if you put your healing hands on me)
Touch me (Everyone of my sins, everyone of my sins)
All I need is a touch (Will be washed away)
Touch me (I wanna be made over, I wanna be made over)
Touch me (everything I've ever needed)
(Healing, peace, joy, unspeakable joy)
All I need is a touch (Till you touch me, Lord Jesus)
Touch me (Till you heal me, Lord Jesus)
Touch me (Till I shine in the light of your glory
Touch me (one more time)
All I need (I will, I will, I will))
(Chorus)
All I need (All I've ever needed)
Is a touch from you (even me, even a wretch like me)
All I need is a touch from you
(Outro)
Don't be afraid
Don't be afraid join me at the alter
God is here love is here
