[Verse 1]
Butterfly, butterfly
Where you gonna go tonight
Wish I was just like you
Maybe then you'll take me high
[Pre-Chorus]
Away from it all again
Away from my troubles and my sins
Away from the fears inside
Away from the tears I try to hide away, 'cause
[Chorus]
I just want to make you smile, but
I know that'll take a while, 'cause I'm
Tryin' to find myself
I just want to make you proud, but
I think that I'm runnin' out of time
To figure it out
[Verse 2]
Butterfly, butterfly
Take me on your wings and fly (oh)
Wish I was just like you
Maybe then I'll see the light
