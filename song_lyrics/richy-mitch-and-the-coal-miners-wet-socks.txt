I used to think that you would save me
I treat gold as a fool and a king
Pyrite still shines on those cold cold nights
Real kinds of love don't come with fees
Yeah weâ€™re older now, I've seen the light
The concrete thing that became my rite
I felt some things become aligned --
No I didn't
But I can fake it alright
