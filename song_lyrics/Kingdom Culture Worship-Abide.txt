[Verse]
To be love, is to be loved by You
To be love, is to be loved by You
To be love, is to be loved by You
To be love, is to be loved by You
[Pre-Chorus]
So I won't worry about tomorrow
'Cause all I wanna do, all I wanna do
Is know You
So I won't worry about tomorrow
'Cause all I wanna do, all I wanna do
Is know You
[Chorus]
I wanna be next to You
I wanna be one with Your spirit
Teach me to abide in You
To hear Your voice all around me
Your voice all around me
[Turn]
[Verse]
To be love, is to be loved by You
To be love, is to be loved by You
To be love, is to be loved by You
To be love, is to be loved by You
