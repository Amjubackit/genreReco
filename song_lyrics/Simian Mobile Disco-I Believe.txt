[Hook]
I believe you could be
What I need to believe
I believe you could be
What I need to believe
I believe you could be
What I need to believe
I believe you could be
What I need to believe
[Verse 1]
It's the same old song that I always sing each year
But because it's perennial don't make it less real
And I believe that she could be
What I need to believe
[Hook]
I believe you could be (I believe)
What I need to believe
I believe you could be
What I need to believe (Oh just keeps comin' 'round again)
I believe you could be
What I need to believe (It just keeps comin' 'round again)
I believe you could be
What I need to believe (It just keeps comin' 'round again)
