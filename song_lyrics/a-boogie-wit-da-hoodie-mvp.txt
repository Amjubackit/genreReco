[Chorus: A Boogie wit da Hoodie]
I drop the top on the S63
Flyer than my opps, see they envy me
Passin' it off like CP3
Shawty, she callin' me MVP
I be on time, it's somethin' you ain't ever seen before
They call me the dimer, really want my whole team to score
Damn, yeah, too icy
Yeah, too clean (Woo)
Yeah, my zone
Yeah, two-three
Yeah, got shooters that hit from deep
Bucks like Giannis, yeah, too mean (Woo)
[Verse 1: A Boogie wit da Hoodie]
Bright lights like we at the Garden
On P, don't get me started
Wholе team walk in, we the party
If I can't makе the play, I'ma lob it
If you jump, that's right on your head
Had to put 'em to sleep, go to bed
I'm a star, dropped fifty and left
From the logo like I'm Steph
Put it up, knock 'em down every time
Goin' hard like my life on the line
Catch me on the courtside with a dime
Never losin', I put it on mine
Had to get out my shit, I been layin' low
It get real when it come to the playoffs
You can fight with me, know it's a KO
And they hatin', they know I'ma take off[Chorus: A Boogie wit da Hoodie & 
G-Eazy

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
If you're not in first, you're in last (Last)
Champions don't come in second (Nope)
I shoot my shot like I'm Stephen (Swish)
Shout out Klay Thompson, my bredren (Ayy)
Took this shit 'round the whole universe
You know the Bay's what I'm reppin' (Woo)
Come home and sell out the Oracle
They scream my name when I step in (G)
Courtside next to E-40, me and him kinda like Ricky and Morty (Ayy, ayy)
Two of the biggest and you can't afford me (Nope)
Bein' this rich is a blessin' (Ayy)
Play-in for you gettin' swept
This shit is not goin' seven (Five at best)
I'll be a Warrior for life (Ayy)
But we still got love for Kevin (KD)
Yeah, work smarter, don't work harder
I took a break, need to recharge it (Ah)
Don't fly commercial, I need charter (Ah)
Need a Zendaya like Peter Parker (Like Peter Parker)
Yeah, uh, this shit is not, but I make it look easy
Told 'em let's run it, I keep it one hundred
This champion ring, diamonds dancin' like Breezy (Water)
This shit is not, but we make it look easy
Told 'em let's run it, I keep it one hundred
This champion ring, diamonds dancin' like Breezy (Ayy, ayy)[Chorus: A Boogie wit da Hoodie &
