[Verse 1]
Do you ever feel like breakin' down?
Do you ever feel out of place
Like somehow you just don't belong
And no one understands you?
Do you ever wanna run away?
Do you lock yourself in your room
With the radio on turned up so loud
That no one hears your screamin'?
[Pre-Chorus]
No, you don't know what it's like
When nothin' feels alright
You don't know what it's like
To be like me
[Chorus]
To be hurt, to feel lost
To be left out in the dark
To be kicked when you're down
To feel like you've been pushed around
To be on the edge of breakin' down
And no one's there to save you
No, you don't know what it's like
Welcome to my life
