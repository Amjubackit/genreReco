[Chorus: The Kid LAROI]
I do the same thing I told you that I never would
I told you I'd change, even when I knew I never could
I know that I can't find nobody else as good as you
I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey (Oh)
[Verse 1: The Kid LAROI]
I get drunk, wake up, I'm wasted still
I realize the time that I wasted here
I feel like you can't feel the way I feel
Oh, I'll be fucked up if you can't be right here
[Pre-Chorus: The Kid LAROI]
Oh, ooh-woah (Oh, ooh-woah, ooh-woah)
Oh, ooh-woah (Oh, ooh-woah, ooh-woah)
Oh, ooh-woah (Oh, ooh-woah, ooh-woah)
Oh, I'll be fucked up if you can't be right here
[Chorus: The Kid LAROI]
I do the same thing I told you that I never would
I told you I'd change, evеn when I knew I nevеr could
I know that I can't find nobody else as good as you
I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey
I do the same thing I told you that I never would
I told you I'd change, even when I knew I never could
I know that I can't find nobody else as good as you
I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey[Verse 2: Juice WRLD]
Just to make these niggas mad, yeah, I go all out
Tell them haters sit down, time for them to learn up
Working for a new car, I can hit a burnout
Yeah, I go all out, I can have a burn out
Bro said i can't be off the drugs in the field
I was taught to rob the plug, taught to steal
If somebody in our way, we gon' kill
I don't remember what happened anyway, I was over the pills, for real (yeah)
Hater mad, hater really pissed off
Do your dance on they ass, make 'em pissed off (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
VVS up on my wrist just like some Kristal
R. Kelly with these hoes, they be pissed off
[Pre-Chorus: Juice WRLD]
You know how I go up (Oh, ooh-woah, ooh-woah)
Show up (Oh, ooh-woah, ooh-woah)
Go up (Oh, ooh-woah, ooh-woah)
And throw them hunnids in the air and turn up the stereo
[Chorus x2: The Kid LAROI]
I do the same thing I told you that I never would
I told you I'd change, even when I knew I never could
I know that I can't find nobody else as good as you
I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey
I do the same thing I told you that I never would
I told you I'd change, even when I knew I never could
I know that I can't find nobody else as good as you
I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey
