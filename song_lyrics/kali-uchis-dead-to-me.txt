[Intro]
(You're dead to me)
(You're dead to me)
Woo, ooh, ooh (Ooh)
Woo, ooh, ooh (Ooh)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (Ooh)
Woo, ooh, ooh
[Verse 1]
I don't know what you been told
See, I am not your enemy (Uh, oh-oh)
But if there's one thing that I know
Is that you ain't a friend to me (Uh, oh-oh)
So don't come for me unless I send for you
Know you're dead to me (Uh, oh-oh)
Just don't come for me, I won't send for you
Know you're dead to me
You're dead to me, oh
[Chorus]
You're dead to me (You're dead to me)
You're obsessed, just let me go
You're dead to me (You're dead to me)
I'm not somebody you know
You're dead to me (You're dead to me)
Could you just leave me alone?
You're dead to me[Verse 2]
What you say to me? I can't hear a thing
Try to talk some sense to myself, but I won't listen
I'm what God made of me, don't need to pretend
It's okay to disagree, we don't have to be friends
See, you think you got problems with me?
But, baby, I don't even think about you
You're mad at everything I do
But what are you up to? I haven't a clue
'Cause, baby, you're dead to me
Why can't I be dead to you?
I think that we both know the truth
[Chorus]
You're obsessed, just let it go
You're dead to me (You're dead to me)
You're obsessed, just let me go
You're dead to me (You're dead to me)
I'm not somebody you know
You're dead to me (You're dead to me)
Could you just leave me alone?
You're dead to me (You're dead to me)
[Bridge]
Why can't you see you're dead to me?
(Wow-wow, woah, wow-wow, woah)
Just let it be, you're dead to me
(Wow-wow, woah, wow-wow, woah)
Why can't you see you're dead to me?
(Wow-wow, woah, wow-wow, woah)
Just let it be, you're dead to me
(Wow-wow, woah, wow-wow, woah)[Chorus]
You're obsessed, just let it go
You're dead to me (You're dead to me)
You're obsessed, just let me go
You're dead to me (You're dead to me)
I'm not somebody you know
You're dead to me (Baby, you're dead to me)
Could you just leave me alone?
Baby, you're dead to me, baby, you're dead to me
[Outro]
Baby, you're—
Woah, woah
Baby, you're—
