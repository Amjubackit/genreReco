[Verse 1]
Daddy worked hard, mama worked harder
Propped up on pain pills and pride
They were just kids when I came in this world
And I was a kid when they died
[Verse 2]
They'd fight about money, they'd fight about fighting
They'd fight about nothing at all
The car was still running when the deputy found 'em
At the Shell by the Gunbarrel Mall
[Chorus 1]
Take me away from here
No, I never belonged to this place
Wish I could disappear off the edge of the earth
Take me away from here
No, I don't wanna fight for the rest of my life
I ain't your volunteer
[Verse 3]
I cried when I missed em, got lost in the system
Foster homes passed me around
The last one was nice but I ran away twice
And they gave up on tracking me down[Verse 4]
I met a girl, said she's from Chattanooga
But I think she grew up out west
Can't say I love her but she's someone to talk to
And I like the tattoo on her chest
[Verse 5]
I found us a spot in the KOA campground
She says she sleeps good in the Scout
But I got in a fight with the neighbor last night
And they'll probably be kicking us out
[Verse 6]
Some nights I dream that I'm in Colorado
Working a cannabis farm
Some nights I dream that the ghost of my mama
Is holding me tight in her arms
[Chorus 1]
Take me away from here
No, I never belonged to this place
Wish I could disappear off the edge of the earth someday
Take me away from here
No, I don't wanna fight for the rest of my life
I ain't your volunteer[Chorus 2]
Take me away from here
Now she's licking the blade of a ten-dollar knife
Wish I could disappear off the edge of the earth
Take me away from here
I'm nobody's man and she's nobody's wife
I ain't your volunteer
[Refrain]
I ain't your volunteer
I ain't your volunteer
