[Verse 1: Lucky Daye]
You ain't gotta say much, I can tell that love means somethin' to you
And when we ain't talkin', your thoughts keep tellin' you you're feelin' me too
So why you keep it bottled up? Open, open, let me show you what I could do
I got nothin' to prove if the pressure too hard
And baby, I can turn it loose
[Pre-Chorus: Lucky Daye]
It's good times, tell me, babe, what you waitin' on?
Your eyes say they don't wanna be alone
I want you, you want me too
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
[Chorus: Earth Wind & Fire & Lucky Daye]
But you can't hide (Oh, oh, hide), I bet ya (Oh, oh, ooh)
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, I bet ya, bet ya
Cannot love, cannot love, well, I bet ya (Well I bet ya)
Oh, oh-oh, oh, ooh (I feel it inside)
[Verse 2: Lucky Daye]
(Ooh)
All you gotta do is try
Don't let the moment pass you by (Ooh)
You wanna show me what's inside
I can see it all in your eyes
[Pre-Chorus: Lucky Daye]
It's good times, tell me, babe, what you waitin' on?
Your eyes say they don't wanna be alone
But you won't find out if you never try
[Chorus: Earth Wind & Fire, Lucky Daye, Both]
You want my love (You want my love), I bet ya (Oh, oh-woah, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ah, ah, oh)
I bet ya
Can't find love (Can't find it), can't find the love (You can't find it), can't find the love (The love, ooh, woah)
Well, I bet ya
Oh, oh, oh, oh, uh, I feel it inside (Ooh)
[Verse 3: Earth Wind & Fire]
Lovers find the time for kissin', yeah
Can you find the time to listen?
Lies found the time to hold you, yeah
And you found the time to listen, yeah, how, how?
[Outro: Earth Wind & Fire & Lucky Daye]
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, ah)
Say you feel it, baby, come home (Come home)
Feel it, baby, come home (Come home)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, ah)
Hey-hey, hey-hey, yeah
Say you feel it, baby, come home (Come home)
Feel it, baby, come home (Come home)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, ah)
