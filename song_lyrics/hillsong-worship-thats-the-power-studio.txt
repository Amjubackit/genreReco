[Verse 1]
There's a name that levels mountains
And carves out highways through the sea
And I've seen its power unravel battles
Right in front of me (Yeah)
Oh, there's a faith that stands defiant
Sends Goliath to his knees
I've seen His praise unravel shackles
Right off my feet
[Chorus]
That's the power of Your name
Just a mention makes a way
Giants fall and strongholds break, and there is healing
And that's the power that I claim
It's the same that rolled the grave
And there's no power like the mighty name of Jesus
[Post-Chorus]
Yeah!
[Verse 2]
There's a hope that calls out courage
In the furnace unafraid
The kind of daring expectation
That every prayer I make is on an empty grave
[Chorus]
That's the power of Your name
Just a mention makes a way
Giants fall and strongholds break, and there is healing
That's the power that I claim
It's the same that rolled the grave
And there's no power like the mighty name of Jesus
There's no power like the mighty name of Jesus
[Bridge]
I see You taking ground
I see You press ahead
Your power is dangerous to the enemy's camp
You still do miracles
And You will do what You said
For You're the same God now as You've always been, hey
Your Spirit breaking out
Your kingdom moving in
Your victory claims the ground that the enemy had (Yes, it did, yes, it did)
You still do miracles
And You will do what You said
For You're the same God now as You've always been
[Chorus]
And that's the power of Your name
Just a mention makes a way
Giants fall and strongholds break, and there is healing
Oh, that's the power that I claim
It's the same that rolled the grave
And there's no power like the mighty name of Jesus
There's no power like the mighty name of Jesus
There's no power like the mighty name of Jesus
There's no power like the mighty name of Jesus
