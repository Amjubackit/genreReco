[Intro: Tyler, The Creator & 
DJ Drama
]
She could ride my face, I don't want nothin' in return
Her body count and who she fuck ain't never my concern (Y'all niggas weird)
I'm tryna buy my neighbor house (
We back at it
, dogtooth, yuh, dogtooth, yuh)
[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
She could ride my face, I don't want nothin' in return
Except for some her time and all her love, that's my concern
I'm tryna buy my neighbor house and turn it to a yard
If you don't know my grandma name, then we ain't really dogs, bitch
[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
I shook your hand, I don't respect
Don't call me king, I'm not your twin
I'm not your brother, we just met
See, I won't purchase her no Birkin (Uh)
Got hobbies (Uh), got purpose (Woo)
Got thumpers, I'm perfect (Uh)
Yeah, Kelly green wagon look better when the gloom out
Canary shine brighter in the dark, I brought the moon out
The plane fly better when it's just me and the pilot
Tuition for the mileage, it's worth it for the silence
There he go, he cast broads like radios
Shit, your lady knows, it's Young T like baby clothes
And I got that fire, and I got good dick
Guap long, dick long, plus I look good, bitch (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
