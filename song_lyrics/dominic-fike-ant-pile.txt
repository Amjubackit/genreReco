[Verse 1]
First grade (First grade)
Somebody tied you to an ant pile (Ant pile)
And that wasn't even the worst day (Uh-huh)
Back then you knew I always liked you (Uh-huh)
We went to high school (Uh-huh)
And on the first day (First day)
You pushed me up against the brick wall (Brick wall)
You pushed me up against the locker (Locker)
Said let's get home before your mom does (Uh-huh)
Know what your mom does (Uh-huh)
[Verse 2]
She takes a different lover every day
She threw her wedding ring away
But you still love your mama, don't you?
Daniella, she smokes so much nowadays
Sometimes the pipe, but mostly Camels (Mostly Camels)
Sometime around eighth grade remember our bodies were changing
[Chorus]
You looked at me different
(In the middle of, in the middle of)
And held me like you missed me
(In the middle of, in the middle of)
We started to feel different
(In the middle of, in the middle of)
And that was when you kissed me
(In the middle of, in the middle of)
[Verse 3]
Ninth grade (Ninth grade)
I picked you up before the first date (First date)
You were allergic to your entrée (Oh-oh)
You couldn't do pasta (Oh-oh)
And the movie was awful (Oh-oh)
I said, "Let me get a redo
Anywhere you wanna go and you can pick it
I can meet you, like"
[Verse 4]
What's the worst thing to happen next evening?
The tire burst, the fireworks in the theater
The higher-ups will tell you what you can't eat
Where you can't go, how to dress, how to act decent
I've seen you fall to pieces
Seen you completely naked
There's no more ways you can surprise me
[Chorus]
Since you looked at me different
(In the middle of, in the middle of)
And held me like you missed me
(In the middle of, in the middle of)
We started to feel different
(In the middle of, in the middle of)
And that was when you kissed me
(In the middle of, in the middle of, ooh)
