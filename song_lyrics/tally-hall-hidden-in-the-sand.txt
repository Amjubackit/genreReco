[Verse]
We were playing in the sand
And you found a little band
You told me you fell in love with it
Hadn't gone as I'd planned
When you had to bid adieu
Said you'd never love anew
I wondered if I could hold it
And fall in love with it too
You told me to buy a pony
But all I wanted was you
[
Chorus
]
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm (ooh, ooh, ooh)
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm (ooh, ooh, ooh)
Mm-mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm (ooh, ooh, ooh)
Mm-mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm (ooh, ooh, ooh)
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh...
[Outro (Reversed)]
Wouldn't the world be better off if we took nonsense seriously?
