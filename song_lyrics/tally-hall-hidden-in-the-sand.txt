[Verse]
We were playing in the sand
And you found a little band
You told me you fell in love with it
Hadn't gone as I'd planned
When you had to bid adieu (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Said you'd never love anew (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I wondered if I could hold it
And fall in love with it too
You told me to buy a pony
But all I wanted was you
[Chorus]
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Mm-mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Mm-mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
[Outro]
