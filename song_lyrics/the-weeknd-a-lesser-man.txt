[Verse 1]
What you don't even know
I'm a deadbeat man, never know when to fold
Spent a lot for your soul
You gon' make that back, I'ma take what I own
Far away from my home
In this hot-ass town, but my blood's still cold and
Better let them know
[Pre-Chorus]
When you see them that you make sure they pay you
Pay you in cash
I don't do favors
I don't do that
You don't want to see me
See me get mad
No matter how bad you
You think I am, am
[Chorus]
I'm a lesser man, a lesser man
A lesser man than you think I am
You think you know but you have no idea
I'm a lesser man, you're the best of them
Fuck the rest of them
I'm a lessеr man, ah
Ah, than you know[Verse 2]
Show the world what I know
How you work that tongue to collect thеir souls and
Seen you do it before
Make them fall in love, make them beg for more and
You can put on a show
You're my one top star, you're my bottom girl and
Before you kiss 'em and go
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't leave until you make sure they pay you
Pay you in cash
I don't do favors
I don't do that
You don't want to see me
See me get mad
No matter how bad you
You think I am, am
[Chorus]
I'm a lesser man, a lesser man
A lesser man than you think I am
You think you know but you have no idea
I'm a lesser man, you're the best of them
Fuck the rest of them
I'm a lesser man, ah
Ah, than you know[Post-Chorus]
A lesser man than you think I am
A lesser man than you think I am, I am, am
I think you should know, darlin'
Ah
