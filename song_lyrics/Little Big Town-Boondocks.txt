[Chorus]
I feel no shame, I'm proud of where I came from
I was born and raised in the boondocks
One thing I know, no matter where I go
I keep my heart and soul in the boondocks
[Verse 1]
I can feel that
Muddy water runnin' through my veins
And I can hear that
Lullaby of the midnight train
And it sings to me and sounds familiar
[Chorus]
I feel no shame, I'm proud of where I came from
I was born and raised in the boondocks
One thing I know, no matter where I go
I keep my heart and soul in the boondocks
[Verse 2]
I can taste that honeysuckle
And it's still so sweet
When it grows wild
On the banks down at old Camp Creek
Yeah, and it calls to me like a warm wind blowin'
