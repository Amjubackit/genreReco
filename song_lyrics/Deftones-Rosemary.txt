[Verse 1]
There's no sound
But the engines drone
Our minds set free
To roam
[Pre-Chorus]
Time (Shift)
We discover the entry
To other planes
[Verse 2]
Our minds bend
And our fingers fold
Entwined, we dream
Unknown
[Pre-Chorus]
Time (Shift)
We discover the entry
To other planes
[Chorus]
Stay with me
As we cross the empty skies
Come sail with me
[Verse 3]
We slow down
As the engines stall
Our eyes catch sync
Explode
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Time (Shift)
We discover the entry
To other planes
Time (Shift)
As we collide with the energy
In other ways
[Chorus]
Stay with me
As we cross the empty skies
Come sail with me
[Outro]
We play in dreams
As we cross through space and time
Just stay with me
