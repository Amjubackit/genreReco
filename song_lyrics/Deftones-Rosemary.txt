[Verse 1]
There's no sound
But the engines drone
Our minds set free
To roam
[Pre-Chorus]
Time (Shift)
We discover the entry
To other planes
[Verse 2]
Our minds bend
And our fingers fold
Entwined, we dream
Unknown
[Pre-Chorus]
Time (Shift)
We discover the entry
To other planes
[Chorus]
Stay with me
As we cross the empty skies
Come sail with me
