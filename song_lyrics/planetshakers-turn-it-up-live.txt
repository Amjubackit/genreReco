[Verse 1]
You are here, as we lift You up
You are riding on our praise
Be enthroned over everything
You are seated in our praise
[Pre-Chorus]
This is prophetic, I can feel it in the air
We lift our praise and You change the atmosphere
With hearts open now, everybody singing out, whoa
[Chorus]
Turn it up, this sound of praise
Make it louder than any other
Lift Him up and shout His name over all
[Verse 2]
As we praise, well, I can feel the change
As Your presence now invades
Hear the sound of the broken chains
Prison doors are giving way
[Pre-Chorus]
This is prophetic, I can feel it in the air
We lift our praise and You change the atmosphere
With hearts open now, everybody singing out, "I am free"[Chorus]
Turn it up, this sound of praise
Make it louder than any other
Lift Him up and shout His name over all
Turn it up, this sound of praise
Make it louder than any other
Lift Him up and shout His name over all
[Bridge]
Our praise goes up
Your rain comes down
Our praise goes up
Your rain comes down
Our praise goes up
Your rain comes down
Our praise goes up
Your rain comes down
[Breakdown]
With shouts of praise we celebrate
King of glory, enter in
You are riding on our praise, O Lord
[Chorus]
Turn it up, this sound of praise
Make it louder than any other
Lift Him up and shout His name over all
Turn it up, this sound of praise
Make it louder than any other
Lift Him up and shout His name over all
