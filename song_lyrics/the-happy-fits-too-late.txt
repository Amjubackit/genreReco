[Intro]
Un, deux, trois, hmm!
[Verse 1]
Move your hips along with the music
Lick your lips but don’t over-do it
Bend your knees along with the summer
Keep your beat but don’t kill the drummer
[Pre-Chorus 1]
It’s true
I wanna be with you tonight
But I’m a little too late
[Verse 2]
Just be calm and move with the season
Winter’s gone and so has your reason
Daisies bloom and so will desire
Keep your cool and blow out the fire
[Pre-Chorus 2]
It's true
I wanna be with you tonight
But I’m a little too late, I’m a little too late
I'm a little too late, too late, too late![Chorus 1]
I could be whole if I didn’t know
I could be whole if I didn't know
About the birdies and the bees and the bushes
Eighteen came around and it was somewhat malicious
Everybody loses control
I’m a little scared of my soul
Find her, keep her, don’t you go near or cheat her
Just you believe that you were born enough
I could be whole if I didn’t know
I could be whole if I didn't
Know about the dangers of foreign stock exchanges
From candy-ridden strangers; I just wanna be with you
I wanna be with you tonight
But I’m a little too late!
[Instrumental]
[Verse 2]
Just be calm and move with the seasons
Winter’s gone and so has your reason
Daisies bloom and so will desire
Keep your cool and blow out the fire[Pre-Chorus 2]
It's true
I wanna be with you tonight
But I’m a little too late, I’m a little too late
I'm a little too late, too late, too late!
[Chorus 2]
I could be whole if I didn’t know
I could be whole if I didn't
Know about the cooties and the creeps they commission
Even when they're dirty, I would find it delicious
Everybody loses control
I’m a little scared of my soul
Find her, keep her, don’t you go near or cheat her
Just you believe that you were born enough
I could be whole if I didn’t know
I could be whole 
if I didn’t
Go out passing free notes with all the secrets we know
From half-bred Filipinos
; I just wanna be with you
I wanna be with you tonight
But I’m a little too late
