[Verse]
Who opens doors that I can not see
Jesus will, Jesus will (oh, oh oh oh)
Who will make all my decisions for me
Jesus will, Jesus will (who opens doors)
Who opens doors that I can not see
Jesus will, Jesus will
Who will make all my decisions for me
Jesus will, Jesus will
When I'm in trouble He gives me a song
In the night season and all the day long
Who makes me do right when I would do wrong
Jesus will, Jesus will
[Chorus]
Oh yeah Jesus will
(I know He will because He said He will)
Oh yeah Jesus will
I know He will (I know He will)
He said He will (He said He will)
He'll fight my battles (He'll fight my battles)
If I keep still (If I keep still)
I know that He will, Jesus will
[Outro]
For I know Jesus will (repeat until end)
