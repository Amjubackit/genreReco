[Verse 1: SEBASTIAN]
There you see her
Sitting there across the way
She don't got a lot to say
But there's somet'ing about her
And you don't know why
But you're dying to try
You wanna kiss the girl
[Verse 2: SEBASTIAN]
Yes, you want her
Look at her, you know you do
Possible she want you too
Use your words, boy, and ask her
If the time is right and the time is tonight
Go on and kiss the girl
[Chorus: ALL, 
SCUTTLE
, 
SEBASTIAN
]
Sha-la-la-la-la-la, my, oh, my
Look like the boy too shy
Ain't gonna kiss the girl
Sha-la-la-la-la-la, ain't that sad?
Ain't it a shame? Too bad
He gonna 
miss the girl
Hey, pull it back, Scuttle, pull it back!
