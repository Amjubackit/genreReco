[Verse 1]
Same shit, different day, saying things I shouldn't say
Flying off the handles, but the people tell me "never change"
Wind up, watch me go, get your tickets to the show
Maybe I should take it slow, but that's not how the money rolls
[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna know what youʼre thinkin'
I got a couple secrets too
Bull in a china shop
Tear it up no matter what
Ask me if I give a fuck
[Chorus]
I wanna be your golden boy
But I got a past you canʼt avoid
Nobodyʼs perfect anymore
So why canʼt I be your golden boy?
[Verse 2]
Catch me barking up a tree, smile wide as money green
You should mind your business, but my business is the place to be
Everything is too PC, diplomats are not for me
Understand you look at me like I'm foreign, but that's my persona, man, I am American
[Chorus 2]
I wanna be your golden boy
But I got a past you canʼt avoid
Nobodyʼs perfect anymore
So why canʼt I be your golden boy?
I wanna be your golden boy
But too many brain cells I destroyed
Nobodyʼs perfect anymore
So why canʼt I be your golden boy?[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna know what youʼre thinkin'
I got a couple secrets too
I wanna know what youʼre drinking
I ainʼt got nothing else to do
Bull in a china shop
Tear it up no matter what
Ask me if I give a fuck
[Chorus 2]
I wanna be your golden boy
But I got a past you canʼt avoid
Nobodyʼs perfect anymore
So why canʼt I be your golden boy?
I wanna be your golden boy
But too many brain cells I destroyed
Nobodyʼs perfect anymore
So why canʼt I be your golden, golden, golden boy?
