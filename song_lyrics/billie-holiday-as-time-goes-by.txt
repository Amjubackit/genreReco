[Verse 1]
You must remember this
A kiss is still a kiss
A sigh is just a sigh
The fundamental things apply
As time goes by
[Verse 2]
And when two lovers woo
They still say, "I love you"
On that you can rely
No matter what the future brings
As time goes by
[Bridge]
Moonlight and love songs, never out of date
Hearts filled with passion, jealousy and hate
Woman needs man and man must have his mate
That, no one can deny
[Verse 3]
It's still the same old story
A fight for love and glory
A case of do or die
The world will always welcome lovers
As time goes by[Bridge]
Moonlight and love songs, never out of date
Hearts full of passion, jealousy and hate
Woman needs man, man must have his mate
That, no one can deny
[Verse 3]
It's still the same old story
A fight for love and glory
A case of do or die
The world will always welcome lovers
As time goes by
