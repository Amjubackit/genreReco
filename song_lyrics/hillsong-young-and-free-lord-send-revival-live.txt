[Verse 1]
Peace like a river wash over me
Immerse me in water as deep as the sea
Hide me in love Your healing embrace
Peace like a river wash over me
[Chorus]
As I worship Your majesty
I worship Your holy name
Jesus my everything
All that I am is Yours
[Verse 2]
Come Holy Spirit rain down on me
Break open the heavens and drench the unseen
Pour out Your presence as I pour out Your praise
Come Holy Spirit, Lord have Your way
[Chorus]
As I worship Your majesty
I worship Your holy name
Jesus my everything
All that I am is Yours
I worship Your majesty
I worship Your holy name
Jesus my everything
All that I am is Yours
[Bridge 1]
Open the Heavens
Fling wide the gates
Flood every heart with mercy
Pour out Your presence inhabit our praise
As we cry holy, holy
Open the Heavens
Fling wide the gates
Flood every heart with mercy
Pour out Your presence inhabit our praise
As we cry holy, holy
Open the Heavens
Fling wide the gates
Flood every heart with mercy
Pour out Your presence inhabit our praise
As we cry holy, holy
[Tag 1]
Whoa, whoa
As we cry holy, holy
Whoa, whoa
