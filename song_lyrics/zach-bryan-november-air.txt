[Verse 1]
You remember sittin' there
One rainy night in a well-used chair
Tellin' me how well you used to dance
The western wind will come again
And make you feel like you did
When all those cowboys didn't stand a chance
[Verse 2]
Said his life took most of you, gave you twice and the day was through
You said it all turned out awfully fair
So tell me tales of all the times and all the seasons you got by
Breathin' in that cold November air
[Refrain]
When no one was there
No one was there
When no one was there
[Verse 3]
Two kids 'bout twenty-three
And the sunsets you'll never see
You were yellin' "supper" from the yard
And they grew old and sailed away
Called you on phones from far away
Wrote you novels on postcards
[Verse 4]
And all you ever wanted
Was to see your children fly
Maybe one day they're a star
But there ain't no leavin'
This small town this evenin'
You can't even drive your own car
[Refrain]
Through November air
Through November air
Through November air
[Chorus]
Dear Mama, how's it goin'?
Was the weather fair last week?
Dear Mama, they were wonderful
All the sights you'll never see
And dear Mama, if I could hold you, I'd grab you by the arms
Tell you what it means
You could take a worthless poor boy from the flats
And make him mean something
[Verse 5]
Tell us what you wanted to
In all we did, we needed you
Your dreams were too small to care
But I'm always reminded
If you look hard, you'll find it
Memory gives warmth to right here
[Refrain]
Through November air
Through November air
Through November air
[Chorus]
Dear Mama, how's it goin'?
Was the weather fair last week?
Dear Mama, they were wonderful
All the sights you'll never see
And dear Mama, if I could hold you, I'd grab you by the arms
Tell you what it means
You could take a worthless poor boy from the flats
And make him mean something
[Outro]
You remember sittin' there
One rainy night in a well-used chair
Tellin' me how well you used to dance
The western wind will come again
And make you feel like you did
When all those cowboys didn't stand a chance
