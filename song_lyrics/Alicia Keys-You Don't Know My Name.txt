[Verse 1]
Baby, baby, baby
From the day I saw you
I really, really wanna catch your eye
There's something special 'bout you
I must really like you
There's not a lotta guys are worth my time
Ooh baby, baby, baby
It's gettin' kind of crazy
'Cause you are takin' over my mind
[Chorus]
And it feels like, ooh
But you don't know my name
And I swear, it feels like, ooh (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
But you don't know my name
('Round and 'round and 'round we go, will you ever know?)
[Verse 2]
Oh, baby, baby, baby
I see us on our first date
You're doin' everything that makes me smile
And when we had our first kiss
It happened on a Thursday
Ooh, it set my soul on fire
Ooh, baby, baby, baby
I can't wait for the first time
My imagination's runnin' wild
