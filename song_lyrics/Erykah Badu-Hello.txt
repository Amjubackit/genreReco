[Chorus: Erykah Badu]
Hello, hello, hey, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hey, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hey, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hey, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hey, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hey, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hey, hello, hello
[Verse 1: André 3000]
Okay, challenge
Leave your phone unlocked and right side up
Walk out the room without throwin' your bitch off balance
It's either on or off, ain't no in between when it's valid
I seem to wanna talk more and more 'bout what really matters
I've seen my aura hop out my torso and hit her backwards
Flip, watchin' you skip down my corridor, fuck a ballad
Don't need shit on the side no more, all entreé, fuck a salad
I often have awesome thoughts of tossin' this softer palate
So when we fall any wall, any stall, any crawl, any pause
Any scar, any tar, any dark will dissolve, kill them all
Build-A-Bear, build them all, build it where it won't fall
Give it all, give it my all, yeah
Don't wear any drawers, any bra, anymore, in it raw, isn't it raw?
I'm in awe, I'm involved, common law, cummin' on stomach wall
Kermit frog jump off London fog
Bridges in the midst of callgirls my woman calls
Unicorn, 
you my porn
