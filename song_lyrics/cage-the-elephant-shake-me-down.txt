[Verse 1]
Shake me down, not a lot of people left around
Who knows now? Softly laying on the ground
Oooh not a lot of people left around oooh oooh
[Verse 2]
In my life I have seen people walk into the sea
Just to find memories plagued by constant misery
Their eyes cast down, fixed upon the ground
Their eyes cast down
[Chorus 1]
I'll keep my eyes fixed on the sun
[Verse 3]
Shake me down, 
cut my head on a silver cloud
Broken sound, softly laying on the ground
Oooh not a lot of people left around oooh oooh
[Verse 4]
In my past, bittersweet, there's no love between the sheets
Taste the blood, broken dreams, lonely times in deed
With eyes cast down, fixed upon the ground, with eyes cast down
[Chorus 2]
I'll keep my eyes fixed on the sun
Turn back now, it's time for me to let go
Way down, had to find a place to lay low
Lamp shade, turned around into a light post
