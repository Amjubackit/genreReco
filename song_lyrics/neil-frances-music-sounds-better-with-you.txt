Ooh, baby
I feel like music sounds better with you

I feel so good
I feel like music sounds better with you
Love might bring us back together

I feel so good
I feel so good

Ooh, baby
I feel like music sounds better with you
Love might bring us back together
I feel so good
I feel like music sounds better with you
Love might bring us back together

Bring us back together
Bring us back together
I feel so good
I feel so good
Music sounds better with you
(Oh-oh)
[Chorus]
Ooh, baby
I feel like music sounds better with you
Love might bring us back together
I feel so good
I feel like music sounds better with you
Love might bring us back together
