[Verse 1: SZA]
Good day in my mind, safe to take a step out
Get some air now, let yo edge out
Too soon, I spoke
You be heavy in my mind, can you get the heck out?
I need rest now, got me bummed out
You so, you so, you
Baby, baby, babe
I've been on my empty mind shit
[Pre-Chorus: SZA]
I try to keep from losin' the rest of me
I worry that I wasted the best of me on you, babe
You don't care
Said, "Not tryna be a nuisance, this is urgent"
Tryna make sense of loose change
Got me a war in my mind
Gotta let go of weight, can't keep what's holdin' me
Choose to watch while the world break up in front of me
[Chorus: SZA,

All the while, I'll await my armored fate with a smile
Still wanna try, still believe in
Good days
, good days, always
Always inside (
Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind
)
Good day living in my mind
