[Verse 1]
Guess we caught up with telling a lie
Now you're leaving me lonely
I could get in my car, end up drunk at some bar
But that was the old me
Remember the night that we slept on the floor
And you told me you loved me
Bet you don’t ever think 'bout that
[Chorus]
It's kinda like a light went off
And now you’re dead set on giving me up
Talking like we're so far gone and
There ain't no use stitching it up
We could do the long haul
We could ride it out, I know the ride's rough
But try us
You're just thinking 'bout tomorrow
[Verse 2]
I'm on the road while you're waiting at home
But I swear I’ll be right back
You’ll find some man with no rock 'n’ roll band and maybe you'll like that
Remember the lake when it started to rain, babe
And I just held you
Bet you don't even think 'bout that
