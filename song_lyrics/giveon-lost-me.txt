[Intro]
Oh, oh-oh, ooh-woah
Oh, oh-oh, woah, oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, mm
[Verse 1]
Was it all my fault?
Maybe one day, I'll grow
I'm not fixin' what broke us
Instead, I'm
In this ride and I barely know her
But she already know what it is
Oh-oh, oh-oh
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not lookin' for the one
Later, but for now I'm havin' fun
I'm done 'cause I always get hurt
Won't be here for long
Baby, you can hate me if you want
But now, I gotta put myself first
[Chorus]
We can kiss, we can touch and do it often (Ooh, ooh)
But if you're here lookin' for love, that's when you lost me (You lost me, you lost me)
Hey, yeah, yeah
We can kiss, we can touch and do it often (Often)
But if you're here lookin' for love, that's when you lost me (You lost me, you lost me)
Hey, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh-oh, ooh-woah (Lost me)
Oh, oh-oh, woah, oh (Lost me)
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, mm (Lost me)
[Verse 2]
Nights spent all alone (Hate it)
Won't be here for long (Face it)
Put your number in my phone, but don't save it (Please, don't, please, don't fall for me)
Visit once or twice and then you made assumptions
Thinkin' it was more
Now you're understandin' that it all meant nothin'
To me, yeah
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not lookin' for the one (One)
Later, but for now I'm havin' fun (I'm havin' fun)
I'm done 'cause I always get hurt
Won't be here for long
Baby, you can hate me if you want
But now, I gotta put myself first
[Chorus]
We can kiss, we can touch and do it often (Often)
But if you're here lookin' for love, that's when you lost me (You lost me, you lost me, yeah)
Hey, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh-oh, ooh-woah (Lost me)
Oh, oh-oh, woah, oh (Lost me)
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, mm (Lost me)
[Outro]
It wasn't all my fault (Mm-mm)
Just thought I'd let you know (Yeah, yeah)
Something's gotten into me
Ever since you let me go
[Instrumental Break]
[Interlude: GIVÄ’ON's mother]
No matter how good you think somebody is
Always protect your heart
There's no such thing as a perfect relationship
Because there's no such thing as perfect people
So just learn from it and move forward
