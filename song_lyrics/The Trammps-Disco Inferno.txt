[Intro]
Burn, baby, burn
Burn, baby, burn
Burn, baby, burn
Burn, baby, burn, burning
[Verse 1]
To my surprise, listen, one hundred stories high
People getting loose, y'all, getting down on the roof, do ya hear?
The funk was flaming, out of control
It was so entertaining when the boogie started to explode, I heard somebody say
[Chorus]
(
Burn, baby, burn
) Disco inferno
(
Burn, baby, burn
) Burn the mother down
(
Burn, baby, burn
) Disco inferno, yeah
(
Burn, baby, burn
) Burn the mother down (
Burning
)
[Verse 2]
Satisfaction (
Ooh-ooh-ooh
)
Came in the chain reaction (
Burning
)
I couldn't get enough
'Til I had to self-destruct (
Ooh-ooh-ooh
)
The heat was on (
Burning
)
Rising to the top, mm
Everybody's going strong (
Ooh-ooh-ooh
)
And that is when my spark got hot, I heard somebody say
