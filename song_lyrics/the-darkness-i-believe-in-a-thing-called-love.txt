[Verse 1]
Can't explain all the feelings that you're making me feel
My heart's in overdrive and you're behind the steering wheel
[Pre-Chorus]
Touching you
Touching me
Touching you, God, you're touching me
[Chorus]
I believe in a thing called love
Just listen to the rhythm of my heart
There's a chance we could make it now
We'll be rocking 'til the sun goes down
I believe in a thing called love
Oohooh
Huh
[Bridge]
[Solo 1]
[Verse 2]
I wanna kiss you 
every minute, every hour, every day
You got me in a spin but everythin' is a-okay
[Pre-Chorus]
(Ayyy ayyy)
Touching you
(Ayyy ayyy)
Touching me
(Ayyy ayyy)
Touching you, God, you're touching me[Chorus]
I believe in a thing called love
Just listen to the rhythm of my heart
There's a chance we could make it now
We'll be rocking 'til the sun goes down
I believe in a thing called love
Oohooh
Guitar!
[Bridge]
[Solo 2]
[Pre-Chorus]
(Ayyy ayyy)
Touching you (you're touching me)
(Ayyy ayyy)
Touching me (I'm touching you)
Touching you, God, you're touching me
Ahhhhh!
[Outro]
I believe in a thing called love
Just listen to the rhythm of my heart
There's a chance we could make it now
We'll be rocking 'til the sun goes down
I believe in a thing called love
Oh oh ohoh ohhhh![Solo 3]
