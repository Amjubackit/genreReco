[Verse 1]
I fight fire with fire
And I run rivers in rain
A fever spreading like wild
Gon' kill like Abel and Cain
[Pre-Chorus]
Nobody to see, nobody to lose
Youngblood on the street
Been blackened and bruised
Get ready for me, I'm ready for you
Go sharpen the blade, bear witness to truth
[Refrain]
Oh my, those teeth are pearly white
The better to eat you with
[Chorus]
And I'm like, hey
Ooh, my heavy metal dreamer (Hey!)
Get ready for some 
third rail
 love (Hey!)
Ooh, my pretty little demon (Hey!)
I burn bright like the midnight sun
[Verse 3]
Rage like Eve in the garden
Oh, the sweetest fruit you can bear
When the riptide's draggin' you under
Are you gonna drown?
