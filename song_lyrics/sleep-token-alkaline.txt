[Verse 1]
Every once in a while, something changes
And she's changing me
It's too late for me now, I am altered
There is something beneath
[Chorus]
She's not acid nor alkaline
Caught between black and white
Not quite either day or night
She's perfectly misaligned
I'm caught up in her design
And how it connects to mine
I see in a different light
The object of my desire
[Verse 2]
Ooh, let's talk about chemistry
'Cause I'm dying to melt through
To the hеart of her molecules
'Til thе particles part like holy water
If anything, she's an undiscovered element
Either born in hell or heaven-sent
Either way, I'm into it
[Chorus]
She's not acid nor alkaline
Caught between black and white
Not quite either day or night
She's perfectly misaligned
I'm caught up in her design
And how it connects to mine
I see in a different light
The object of my desire
