[Intro]
Uh, uh uh
Uh, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
[Verse 1]
I look so obedient
But I'm just a deviant
Baby doll dressed in white, but
I'mma give you a fright, 'cause
I keep it simple, keep it fresh
Eat it till there's nothing left
I got an appetite
So I'm keepin' you up all night
[Chorus]
Beggin', beggin'
I'll get you beggin', beggin'
Beggin', beggin'
For me to leave ya
Beggin', beggin'
I'll get you beggin', beggin'
Beggin', beggin'
'Cause I'm your weakness
[Post-Chorus]
Uh, uh uh
Uh, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh ('Cause I'm your weakness)
Uh, uh uh
Uh, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh ('Cause I'm your weakness)[Chorus]
Beggin', beggin'
I'll get you beggin', beggin'
Beggin', beggin'
For me to leave ya
Beggin', beggin'
I'll get you beggin', beggin'
Beggin', beggin'
'Cause I'm your weakness
[Post-Chorus]
'Cause I'm your weakness
'Cause I'm your weakness
Uh, uh uh
Uh, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
Uh, uh uh
Uh, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
[Verse 2]
You got what you came for, baby
Now you wanting more
Gotta teach you to savor
Taking too much of my flavor
Didn't think you wanted me
'Cause you thought I come for free
Now you be on my floor
Sittin' right outside my door[Chorus]
Beggin', beggin'
I'll get you beggin', beggin'
Beggin', beggin'
For me to leave ya
Beggin', beggin'
I'll get you beggin', beggin'
Beggin', beggin'
'Cause I'm your weakness
Beggin', beggin'
I'll get you beggin', beggin'
Beggin', beggin'
For me to leave ya
Beggin', beggin'
I'll get you beggin', beggin'
Beggin', beggin'
'Cause I'm your weakness
[Post-Chorus]
Uh, uh uh
Uh, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh ('Cause I'm your weakness)
Uh, uh uh
Uh, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh ('Cause I'm your weakness)
Uh, uh uh
Uh, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh ('Cause I'm your weakness)
Uh, uh uh
Uh, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh ('Cause I'm your weakness)[Outro]

Keeping you up all night
Keeping you up all night
