[Verse 1]
If I'm a bad person, you don't like me
Well, I guess I'll make my own way
It's a circle, a mean cycle
I can't excite you anymore
Where's your gavel? Your jury?
What's my offense this time?
You're not a judge, but if you're gonna judge me
Oh, sentence me to another life
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't wanna hear your sad songs, I don't wanna feel your pain
When you swear it's all my fault
 
'cause you know we're not the same (No)
We're not the same (Oh)
Oh, we're not the same
Yeah, the friends who stuck together, we wrote our names in blood
But I guess you can't accept that the change is good (Hey)
It's good (Hey)
It's good
[Chorus]
Well, you treat me just like another stranger
Well, it's nice to meet you, sir, I guess I'll go
I best be on my way out
You treat me just like another stranger
Well, it's nice to meet you, sir, I guess I'll go
I best be on my way out
