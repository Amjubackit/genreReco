[Verse 1]
I gotta get myself
Off the side of the road
I gotta get myself
Off the side of the road
Things are lookin clear as they've ever been
Don't know how it'll end but I know where to begin
I gotta get myself
Off the side of the road
[Verse 2]
I got to quit lying to myself
And let the truth be told
I got to quit lying to myself
And let the truth be told
Yeah I woke up burned out by the sun
Tired of layin still so I'm movin along
I got to quit lying to myself
And let the truth be told
Yes
[Chorus]
Whooo oooo oooo
Hey hey
I've gotta pick myself up off the ground
Whooo oooo oooo
Hey hey
I've gotta pick myself up off the ground
[Verse 3]
I gotta hunt myself down a brand new home
I gotta hunt myself down a brand new home
Now I got the answer to my biggest question
Had to lose where I was to get my direction
I gotta hunt myself down
A brand new home
[Verse 4]
The tears that I'm hiding
No they ain't for cryin
The tears that I'm hiding
No they ain't for cryin
I'm never gonna let 'em start spilling out
Cause they pour down my body and they flood the ground
The tears that I'm hiding
No they ain't for crying
[Chorus]
Whooo oooo oooo
Hey hey
I've gotta pick myself up off the ground
Whooo oooo oooo
Hey hey
I've gotta pick myself up off the ground
[Bridge]
Let the truth be told (repeat)
[Verse 5]
I gotta get myself up
Off the side of the road
Quit lying to myself
And let the truth be told
My head is heavy and my heart is empty
But my spirit is strong and my legs are ready
I gotta get myself
Off the side of the road
Quit lying to myself
And let the truth be told
[Chorus]
Whooo oooo oooo
Hey hey
I've gotta pick myself up off the ground
Whooo oooo oooo
Hey hey
I've gotta pick myself up off the ground
