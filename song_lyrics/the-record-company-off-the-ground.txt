[Verse 1]
I gotta get myself
Off the side of the road
I gotta get myself
Off the side of the road
Things are lookin clear as they've ever been
Don't know how it'll end but I know where to begin
I gotta get myself
Off the side of the road
[Verse 2]
I got to quit lying to myself
And let the truth be told
I got to quit lying to myself
And let the truth be told
Yeah I woke up burned out by the sun
Tired of layin still so I'm movin along
I got to quit lying to myself
And let the truth be told
Yes
[Chorus]
Whooo oooo oooo
Hey hey
I've gotta pick myself up off the ground
Whooo oooo oooo
Hey hey
I've gotta pick myself up off the ground
