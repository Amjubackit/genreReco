[Intro]
Hot girls, where I'm from, we don't look like models
Tan lines, big curves, and the energy glows
You'll be fallin’ in love with the girl from Rio (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
[Verse 1]
Let me tell you 'bout a different Rio (Yeah)
The one I'm from, 
but not the one that you know
 (Hey)
The one you meet when you don't have no Real (Hey)
Baby, it's my love affair, it's my love affair, yeah (Hey, hey)
Just found out I have another brother (Hey!)
Same daddy, but a different mother (Have a brother)
This was somethin’ that I always wanted
Baby, it's a love affair, it's a love affair, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, whoa
I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it
It runs in my blood, oh (Hey)
I love it, I love it, I love it, I love it
You already know, oh
A dime, a dozen
I'm lucky, I'm lucky, I'm lucky
I know, oh
It's my love affair, yeah (Um, dois, três, vai)
