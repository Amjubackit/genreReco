[Intro]
Ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba
[Verse 1]
Cut my tongue out, I've been caught out
Like a giant juggernaut
Happy hours, golden showers
On a cruise to freak you out
We could fly a helicopter
Nothing left to talk about
Entertain you, celebrate you
I'll be back to frame you
[Chorus]
When I grow up, I'll be stable
When I grow up, I'll turn the tables
[Verse 2]
Trying hard to fit among you
Floating out to wonderland
Unprotected, God, I'm pregnant
Damn the consequences
[Chorus]
When I grow up, I'll be stable
When I grow up, I'll turn the tables
[Interlude]
Ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba
[Verse 3]
Blood and blisters on my fingers
Chaos rules when we're apart
Watch my temper, I go mental
I'll try to be gentle
[Bridge]
When I grow up, I'll be stable
When I grow up, I'll turn the tables
When I grow up
When I grow up
When I grow up, I'll turn the tables
[Outro]
Don't take offense
Can I make amends?
Rip it all to shreds and let it go
Don't take offense
Can I make amends?
Rip it all to shreds and let it go
I rip it all to shreds and let it go
I rip it all to shreds and let it go
I rip it all to shreds and let it go
Ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba
