[Verse 1]
Beautiful stranger
You come here quite here often
I don't know your name
But I know what you drink
You got a secret
But it's one you can't keep
Oh, beautiful stranger
You're an angel to me
[Verse 2]
So if you're feeling lonely
Come sit next to me
We'll find a slow song to dance to
And strangers no longer we'll be
[Verse 3]
Beautiful stranger
So lovely tonight
Could it be my future
That I see in your eyes?
Take me to Heaven
And do as you please
Oh, beautiful stranger (
Stranger
)
You're an angel (
Angel
) to me (
To me
)[Verse 4]
Beautiful stranger
You come here quite here often
I don't know your name
But I know what you drink
You got a secret
But it's one you can't keep
Oh, beautiful stranger (
Stranger
)
You are like an angel (
Angel
) to me (
Me
)
[Outro]
Oh, beautiful stranger (
Stranger
)
You are like an angel to me (
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
)
