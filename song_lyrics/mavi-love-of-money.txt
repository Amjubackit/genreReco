[Verse]
Yeah, yeah
No self control on my own, alone in niggas to loathe when the money go missing, yeah
In my wallet, in my rib cage, I love love enough for comfort, knowing money go with it
I told her whether you like it or not, this thing of ours tied in a knot, I can't hold it no more
I don't think these venules supposed to hold venom
 or
I don't think exposure to this cold is for a nigga
, boy
I don't even know if all these probes is worth bigger toys
I be talking shit that it ain't English words fitting for
I be in the bottom of the barrel
In the studio was raised in, just consumed in my vocation
That or loopy in rotation, that or
In the oven shooting movies with some brothers
Youthful stupor 'cross our faces, ayy, man
No self control on my own, alone in niggas to loathe when the money go missing, yeah
In my wallet, in my rib cage, I love love enough for comfort, knowing money go
Knowing money go with it
