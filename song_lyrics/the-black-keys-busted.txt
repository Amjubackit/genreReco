[Verse 1]
Well I'm busted, yes I'm busted
But my heart won't let me die
If you feel alright darling
Won't you come around
Won't you come around
'Round
'Round
'Round
'Round
[Verse 2]
If you love me like I love you
Please won't you let me know
I'll play it all night darling
Walk through my door
Walk through my door
Walk through my door
Door
Door
Door
Door
