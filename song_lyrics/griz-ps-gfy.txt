[Intro]
One, two, three, hook!
{Funk hook}
[Verse 1]
Now who I am
Is exactly who I be
Not good enough for you?
Go ahead and find a better me!
(Uh, yeah!)
Now who you are
Is exactly what I see
That shit is killing my vibe
So go on and let me breathe
[Chorus]
I know you all too well
You talk shit, and love the smell
Don't think that I can't tell
You're fake and nothing else
You should know this well
Ain't trying to wish you ill
Hope this life treats you swell
Oh yeah, P.S. go fuck yourself![Bridge 1]
Oh yeah, P.S. go
P.S. go
Ain't trying to wish you ill
(Hey!)
Oh yeah, P.S. go
(I know you all too well)
Oh yeah, P.S. go fuck yourself!
[Verse 2]
All I know
Is I know what I need
All I need is a good time
So you're of no use to me
(Uh, yeah!)
All you know
Is your time ain't worth a thing
You just wanna bring me down
But I want to fly and sing
Yeah!
[Chorus]
I know you all too well
You talk shit, and love the smell
Don't think that I can't tell
Your fake and nothing else
You should know this well
Ain't trying to wish you ill
Hope this life treats you swell
Oh yeah, P.S. go fuck yourself!I know you all too well
You talk shit, and love the smell
Don't think that I can't tell
Your fake and nothing else
You should know this well
Ain't trying to wish you ill
Hope this life treats you swell
Oh yeah, P.S. go
(Get the funk down)
[Bridge 2]
Oh yeah, P.S. go
P.S. go
Ain't trying to wish you ill
