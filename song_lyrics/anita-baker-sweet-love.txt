[Verse 1]
With all my heart, I love you, baby
Stay with me, and you will see
My arms will hold you, baby
Never leave 'cause I believe
[Chorus]
I'm in love, sweet love
Hear me calling out your name—I feel no shame
I'm in love, sweet love
Don't you ever go away, it'll always be this way
[Verse 2]
Your heart has called me closer to you
I will be all that you need
Just trust in what we're feeling
Never leave 'cause, baby, I believe
[Chorus]
In this love, sweet love
Hear me calling out your name—I feel no shame
I'm in love, sweet love;
Don't you ever go away, it'll always be this way
[Bridge]
There's no stronger love in this world—oh, baby, no
You're my man, I'm your girl—I'll never go
Wait and see, can't be wrong
Don't you know this is where you belong?
