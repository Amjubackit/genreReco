[Verse 1]
Everything I’ve lost
Is all I’ve got
There ain’t much I can give
But I’ll give you everything
Anything you had
You gave me half
When I was living with nothing
You helped me believe in something
[Pre-Chorus]
Didn't know where to go, was alone on the outside
Everyday I was waiting to say it's about time
I find one to keep me warm
[Chorus]
I was one of the wandering
Trying to fight through the elements
Time stood still when you first walked in
Fate made plans I could never predict
I was empty, lost without a clue
Until now
Until you
[Verse 2]
Never one to beg
Mmm, still you lent your hand
Found me street penniless
You reached down and crowned me king
[Pre-Chorus]
Didn't know where to go, was alone on the outside
Everyday I was waiting to say it's about time
I find one to keep me warm
[Chorus]
I was one of the wandering
Trying to fight through the elements
Time stood still when you first walked in
Fate made plans I could never predict
I was empty, lost without a clue
Until now
Until you
[Bridge]
Oooh yeah, yeah, and the mornings are golden as your heart
I was down the darkness until you came along
[Pre-Chorus]
Didn't know where to go, was alone on the outside
Everyday I was waiting to say it's about time
I find one to keep me warm
[Chorus]
I was one of the wandering
Trying to fight through the elements
Time stood still when you first walked in
Fate made plans I could never predict
I was empty, lost without a clue
Until now
Until you
[Verse 1 - 1st Half]
Everything I’ve lost
Is all I’ve got
There ain’t much I can give
But I’ll give you everything
