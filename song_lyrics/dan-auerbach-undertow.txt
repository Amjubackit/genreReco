[Verse 1]
The games we play
The tales we spin
Ain't always the way
Original sin
[Pre Chorus]
Would you dive for me
In the icy sea
Pry me free from this life I lead
[Chorus]
Undertow
Sad old memories from so long ago
Here they come to drag me down below
Here it comes, the undertow
[Verse 2]
Solider of fortune, or a broke down dog
Sign of the scorpion, or a hollow log
[Pre Chorus]
Would you dive for me
In the icy sea
Pry me free from this life I lead[Chorus]
Undertow
Sad old memories from so long ago
Here they come to drag me down below
Here it comes, the undertow
[Chorus]
Undertow
Sad old memories from so long
Here they come to drag me down below
Here it comes, the undertow
