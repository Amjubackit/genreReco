[Intro]
Ladies and gentlemen
Introducing the Chocolate Starfish
And the Hotdog Flavored Water
Bring it on
Get the fuck up
Yeah, check, one, two
Listen up, listen up
Here we go (Here we go)
[Verse 1]
It's a fucked up world (World) and a fucked up place (Place)
Everybody's judged by their fucked up face
Fucked up dreams (Dreams), fucked up life (Life)
A fucked up kid with a fucked up knife
Fucked up moms (Moms) and fucked up dads (Dads)
It's a fucked up cop with a fucked up badge
Fucked up job (Job) with fucked up pay
And a fucked up boss, this a fucked up day
Fucked up press (Press) with fucked up lies (Lies)
While Lethal's in the back with the fucked up eyes
[Refrain]
Hey (It's on)
Everybody knows it's on
Hey (It's on)
Everybody knows it's on
