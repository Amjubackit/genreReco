Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
I was running wild, fell in love with the chase
I've been up and down and all over the place
Wasting all my days and nights
Never feeling satisfied (yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah)
Putting on a smile, I was keeping it fake
But there's no imitating what I've found in Your grace
All the things I left behind
Are shadows, now I've seen the light (yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah)
In my head and my soul
My heart, my all
I know that I know, know, know, oh
Never, never have I ever
Ever found a love so good, so good
Never, never am I ever
Ever getting over living with You
Nothing will change it
All I can say is
Never, never have I ever
Ever found a love so good, so good
I've got a million reasons why I can't be the same
You've got me looking forward, never turning my gaze
Forever, God, it's You and I
Together 'til the end of time (yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah)
In my head and my soul
My heart, my all
I know that I know, know, know, oh
Never, never have I ever
Ever found a love so good, so good
Never, never am I ever
Ever getting over living with You
Nothing will change it
All I can say is
Never, never have I ever
Ever found a love so good, so good
Your love is patient, love is kind
Your love is never hard to find
Forever I am Yours and You're mine
All right, all right, oh-oh-oh
Never, never have I ever
Ever found a love so good, so good
Never, never am I ever
Ever getting over living with You
Nothing will change it
All I can say is
Never, never have I ever
Ever found a love so good, so good
Never have I ever, no
Oh, never have I ever, no
