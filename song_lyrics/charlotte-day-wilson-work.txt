[Chorus]
It's gonna take a bit of work
Oh-oh, work
Now that you're here
Woah, work
[Refrain]
'Cause people come and go
But I think you should know
That I, I think this'll work
Ooh
Ooh
[Verse]
It’s gonna take a little time
But with you by my side
I won’t let go
'Til I've got what’s mine
[Refrain]
'Cause people come and go
But you should know
That I, that I
I'll take it slow
Ooh (Ooh, woah)
Ooh (Ooh, oh)
[Chorus]
It’s gonna take a bit of work (A bit of work)
Oh, work (Work, work)
Now that you're here
Woah, work (Work)
It’s gonna take a bit of work (It's gonna take a bit of work)
Oh, work
Now that you're here
Woah, work (Work)
