[Verse 1: Mitchel Cave]
Tell me what it is you wanna know
Finish up the bottle then we'll go, babe
Waste a little money on some blow
She said, "Won't you have a little?"
I said, "No way"
[Pre-Chorus: Mitchel Cave]
I'm too phased, it's too late
But coming down is all I ever do, babe, yeah
And I'm so down if you're ready
I'm floating but I'm heavy
And I'll show you if you let me, girl
[Chorus: Mitchel Cave]
I don't know if you already know how
But girl, I got the feeling that you know now
You're buried in the pillow, yeah, you're so loud
But I'm about to show you, baby, slow down
Slow down, slow down
I'm about to show you, baby, slow down
Slow down, slow down
I'm about to show you, baby, slow down
[Verse 2: Mitchel Cave]
Push a little further on the edge
Crawl a little further on the bed, babe
I'm burning up, yeah, all I see is red, ah
She said, "Fuck me like I'm famous"
I said, "Okay"
[Pre-Chorus: Mitchel Cave]
It's two-faced, it's too late
But coming down is all I ever do, babe
And I'm so down if you're ready
I'm floating but I'm heavy
And I'll show you if you let me, girl
[Chorus: Mitchel Cave]
I don't know if you already know how
But girl, I got the feeling that you know now
You're buried in the pillow, yeah, you're so loud
But I'm about to show you, baby, slow down
Slow down, slow down
I'm about to show you, baby, slow down (Yeah)
Slow down, slow down
I'm about to show you, baby, slow down
[Bridge: Mitchel Cave]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Slow down, slow down (Yeah)
Won't you listen to me? (Yeah)
Drugs all in my system (Slow down)
Tell me what you heard (Yeah)
Tell me what you know (Yeah)
I've been rolling for days, yeah, this is so foreign
Oh vanity, no, listen, baby
[Chorus: Mitchel Cave]
I don't know if you already know how
But girl, I gotta feeling that you know now
You're buried in the pillow, yeah, you're so loud
But I'm about to show you, baby, slow down
Slow down, slow down
I'm about to show you, baby, slow down
Slow down, slow down
I'm about to show you, baby, slow down
(Yeah)
