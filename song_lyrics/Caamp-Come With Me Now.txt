[Verse]
I wanna see ya, and feel ya
And know ya as you move around
I want to lead ya fearless, in moonlight, forward bound
I see a green in your eyes, it is strong
Just like your shoulders
Come with me to the creek, darling
I got something to show ya
[Bridge]
Come with me now
Come with me now
Come with me now
Come with me now
[Refrain]
Come with me now
Come with me now
Come with me now
Come with me now
Come with me now
Come with me now
Come with me now
Come with me now
[Outro]
(Come with me now)
Don't you know? I'm sure you'll come with me
(Come with mะต now)
