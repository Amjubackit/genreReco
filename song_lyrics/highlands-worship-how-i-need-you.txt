[Intro]
Oh, we need You, Jesus
Oh, we need You, God
[Verse 1]
Every day in Your hands
You were there before time began
Sovereign One, I rest in Your plan
From the depths to the dawn
You are there, Your promise is strong
I will trust with all that I am
[Chorus]
Jesus, Jesus, oh, how I need You
You stay the same, You are good in Your ways
Jesus, Jesus, oh, how I need You
You are enough, all my trust is in You, Lord
[Verse 2]
You fashioned me, formed my heart
Searched my soul, and know every thought
Love so great, but never too far
Through the storm, You're the calm
Every war, Youâ€™ve already won
Life secure in Your loving arms[Chorus]
Jesus, Jesus, oh, how I need You
You stay the same, You are good in Your ways
Jesus, Jesus, oh, how I need You
You are enough, all my trust is in You, Lord
[Interlude]
[Bridge]
You are powerful, God above it all
I believe in You, I believe in You
You do miracles, the impossible
I believe in You, I believe in You
You are powerful, God above it all
I believe in You, I believe in You
You do miracles, the impossible
I believe in You, I believe in You
You are powerful, God above it all
I believe in You, I believe in You
You do miracles, the impossible
I believe in You
[Chorus]
Jesus, Jesus, oh, how I need You
You stay the same, You are good in Your ways
Jesus, Jesus, oh, how I need You
You are enough, and all my trust is in You, Lord[Outro]
You are powerful, God above it all
I believe in You, I believe in You
You do miracles, the impossible
I believe in You, I believe in You
You are powerful, God above it all
I believe in You, I believe in You
You do miracles, the impossible
I believe in You, I believe in You
