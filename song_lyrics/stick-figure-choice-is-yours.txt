[Verse 1: Scott Woodruff]
Your mind long gone and you're run down, you're all out of smoke
Light me up a cigarette, before I go
Your whole world fits inside of the palm of your hands
I try to tell 'em man, but they just don't understand
[Chorus]
The choice is yours, when youâ€™re ready
The choice is yours
The choice is yours, taking it easy
The choice is yours, the choice is yours
[Verse 2: Scott Woodruff]
Your arms wide open, the walls are caving in
Don't bury your secrets deep within your skin
When you focus on the good things, all things under the sun
You free yourself from negativity and the good shall come
[Chorus]
[Verse 3: Kyle McDonald]
The choice is yours and the choice is mine
You can't please everybody, all of the time
Ya can hope and pray things will be just fine
But might not know, till the end of the line
Happiness is only a state of mind
Open your eyes, and in time you will find
Open up your heart, let your love light shine
And it don't cost a penny, nickel or dime
Give a little love and keep a little, ain't the way that it goes
What goes around, say, come around, so everyone knows
What you give, is what you get, so take a look, 'cause it shows
Pickin' up your brother any time he feelin' low
Smokin' up a chalice, bowl or spliff of Pakkalo'
Rollin' up the best, and nothin' less than hydro
When I'm smokin on my spliff, don't burn it fast, I like it slow
Moving up in a style, up in a fashion I'm supporting
Open another door, any time another door is closed
Move into the light, in from the dark, now exposed
When I'm reachin into sky, I spread it out, I let it grow
Never do a thing because somebody's sayin so[Outro]
The choice is yours
