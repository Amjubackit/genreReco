[Intro]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Shoo-do, shoo-do, shoo-do
[Verse 1]
Yet another early morning
And you walk in like it's nothing
Hold up, hold up, hold tight
Ain't no donuts, ain't no coffee
See I, know you seen me calling and calling
I should crack you right in your forehead
[Pre-Chorus]
Let me take a breath (Let me take a breath)
And regain my composure
Told you one more time (Told you one more time)
If you f'ed up, it's over
[Chorus]
'Cause when it's gone, it's gone
It's gone, it's gone
You're dead wrong, so wrong
So wrong, so wrong
So just scoo-do-do-do-do
Scoo-do-do-do-do
Baby, it's a wrap
Shoo-do-do-do-do
Shoo-do-do-do-do
For you, baby
It's a wrap
It's a wrap for you, boy
It's a wrap
Aww, baby
Ooh-we, ooh-ooh
E-ooh-ooh[Verse 2]
If I ever misrepresented
My self image, then I'm sorry
I was oh so acquiescent (Acquiescent)
But I learned my lesson
Boy, you're sorry (Boy, you're sorry)
Bump, bump, bump
All out in the open
Don't make me go call Maury Povich
[Pre-Chorus]
Let me take a breath (Let me take a breath)
And regain my composure
Told you one more time (Told you one more time)
If you f'ed up, it's over
[Chorus]
'Cause when it's gone, it's gone
It's gone, it's gone
You're dead wrong, so wrong
So wrong, so wrong
So just scoo-do-do-do-do
Scoo-do-do-do-do
Baby, it's a wrap
Shoo-do-do-do-do
Shoo-do-do-do-do
For you, baby
It's a wrap
It's a wrap for you, boy
It's a wrap
Aww, baby[Bridge]
Put all your shit in the elevator
It's goin' down like a denominator
Tryna to keep holdin' on, holding on
Boy, let me go
You gon' wake my neighbors
Get away from my door
That was your last shot
You ain't coming back
It's the Martini, I mean it, baby
It's a wrap, ap-ap
[Pre-Chorus]
When it's gone, it's gone
It's gone, it's gone
You're dead wrong, so wrong
So wrong, so wrong (You're dead wrong)
[Outro]
So just scoo-do-do-do-do
Scoo-do-do-do-do (Boy, I ain't checkin' the gate)
Baby
Shoo-do-do-do-do
Shoo-do-do-do-do (Yeah, I told you)
Baby (I told you)
It's a wrap (If you f'ed up one more time, it's over)
It's a wrap for you, boy
It's a wrap (So get up out my face, I'm hungover)
Aww, baby
So just scoo-do-do-do-do
Scoo-do-do-do-do (Been sitting here all night, leave me alone)
Baby (Since quarter to three I been)
Shoo-do-do-do-do
Shoo-do-do-do-do
(Drinkin' Patr√≥n)
It's a wrap
Baby (Watch the credits roll)
It's a wrap (It's a wrap)
It's a wrap (Ha)
