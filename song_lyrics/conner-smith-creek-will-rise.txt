[Verse 1]
Well, we were sittin' on the truck bed
When it started rainin', she said, "I don't mind"
Got her dancin' in a white sundress
Couldn't even find one dry thread, my oh my
[Pre-Chorus]
I, I didn't know what I was getting into
I, I wish the four-wheel drive was just two
[Chorus]
'Cause a girl like her on a night like this
Make a man wanna stay right where he is
There's trouble in the way her green eyes are glowin'
I'm holdin' on tight, prayin' and hopin'
This truck battery dies
Or the road's too muddy to drive
Wanna stay right here all night
If the good Lord's willin', that creek will risе
[Verse 2]
Next thing I know
I had my blue jeans hangin' on a tree limb
Shе was smilin' at me, pullin' me in
Out where the creek bend bends in the yellow moon light
Makin' fishin' in the dark come to life
