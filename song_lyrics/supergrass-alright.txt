[Verse 1]
We are young,
 
we run green
Keep our teeth nice and clean
See our friends, see the sights
And feel alright
[Verse 2]
We wake up, we go out
Smoke a fag, put it out
See our friends, see the sights
And feel alright
[Chorus]
Are we like you?
I can't be sure
Of the scene as she turns
We are strange in our worlds
[Verse 3]
But we are young,
 
we get by
Can't go mad, ain't got time
Sleep around if we like
But we're alright
[Verse 4]
Got some cash, bought some wheels
Took it out 'cross the fields
Lost control, hit a wall
But we're alright[Chorus]
Are we like you?
I can't be sure
Of the scene as she turns
We are strange in our worlds
[Verse 1]
But we are young,
 
we run green
Keep our teeth nice and clean
See our friends, see the sights
And feel alright
[Chorus]
Are we like you?
I can't be sure
Of the scene as she turns
We are strange in our worlds
[Verse 1]
But we are young,
 
we run green
Keep our teeth nice and clean
See our friends, see the sights
And feel alright...
