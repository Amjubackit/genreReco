[Intro]
Yeah
[Chorus]
And I'm right back on Rodeo
Still got some boys on the payroll
You niggas still sippin' Karo (Yeah)
She with a P in LA at the condo, we 'bout to eat Maggiano's (Yeah)
Helpin' the P out, so bring me them narcos, thinkin' I should take the Bronco (Yeah)
OJ (Yeah), gotta go get it tomorrow
I'm sellin' out The Apollo, inside my body is hollow (Yeah)
Count up them racks, get your folks out the ghetto, you know that was always the motto (Yeah)
If a nigga wan' talk out the side of his neck, I just let his BM come and swallow
[Verse 1]
Told my lil' brother we pullin' up spankin' these niggas that thinkin' we hoes
Don't do no explainin', don't know what you thinkin', but you help a young nigga grow
You add up thе ten rings on both of my fingers, I paid like six hundrеd or more (Yeah)
Gave out so many bands and bought so many bangers, you ask and the real niggas know
I been puttin' that shit on, showin' these boys how to dress and get fresh and pull up with the hoes (Yeah)
Don't care 'bout no nigga been sendin' me threats, on the West, I get love from the Locs (Yeah)
Let me turn back around and go back to a cell for a nigga with internet jokes (Yeah)
Fuck this shit, I'm still doin' it for Jeff and Lil Keed and you know it's R.I.P. to the Pope (Yeah)
And my heart covered in Chrome, damn, they just now rockin' Chrome
Gunna back up early morn', bad bitches passin' me robes (Yeah)
Half you lil' spenders been doin' it wrong, I never talk on the phone (Nah)
He a clout chaser, they wanna be known, mad that we didn't put 'em on (Yeah)
[Chorus]
And I'm right back on Rodeo
Still got some boys on the payroll
You niggas still sippin' Karo (Yeah)
She with a P in LA at the condo, we 'bout to eat Maggiano's (Yeah)
Helpin' the P out, so bring me them narcos, thinkin' I should take the Bronco (Yeah)
OJ (Yeah), gotta go get it tomorrow
I'm sellin' out The Apollo, inside my body is hollow (Yeah)
Count up them racks, get your folks out the ghetto, you know that was always the motto (Yeah)
If a nigga wan' talk out the side of his neck, I just let his BM come and swallow
[Verse 2]
You pick the fight, ain't no way you can run from it, nigga, 'cause we goin' at it (Yeah)
I know some niggas locked up in the dungeon that say they feel me like a fabric (Yeah)
I know you heard I been pullin' up pressin' these niggas who claimin' I ratted (Yeah)
And been all on the yacht with my motherfuckin' shirt off, look at it, my whole body tatted (Yeah)
Got the T-rex automatic
No, I ain't signed to Atlantic (Nah)
Bulletproof truck and it's matted (Yeah)
Ain't takin' shit else for granted (Nah)
All this shit cost, it ain't nothin' for free in this shit, so, yeah, I gotta have it (Yeah)
Yeah, it's the young Gunna Wunna, and I'm still the big P and a star like Dallas (Yeah)
Back on the Addy
One of my diamonds a Patek (Yeah)
I got these niggas the maddest
I'm dressin' up like a salad (Yeah)
I sent his— (Yeah)
I sent his BM the addy
She done pulled up with no panties
In my Los Angeles palace (Yeah)
[Chorus]
And I'm right back on Rodeo
Still got some boys on the payroll
You niggas still sippin' Karo (Yeah)
She with a P in LA at the condo, we 'bout to eat Maggiano's (Yeah)
Helpin' the P out, so bring me them narcos, thinkin' I should take the Bronco (Yeah)
