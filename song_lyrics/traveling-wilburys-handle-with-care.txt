[Verse 1: George Harrison]
Been beat up and battered around
Been sent up, and I've been shot down
You're the best thing that I've ever found
Handle me with care
[Verse 2: George Harrison]
Reputation's changeable
Situation's tolerable
But, baby, you're adorable
Handle me with care
[Pre-Chorus: Roy Orbison]
I'm so tired of being lonely
I still have some love to give
Won't you show me that you really care?
[Chorus: Bob Dylan and Tom Petty]
Everybody's got somebody to lean on
Put your body next to mine, and dream on
[Verse 3: George Harrison]
I've been fobbed off, and I've been fooled
I've been robbed and ridiculed
In daycare centers and night schools
Handle me with care
[Verse 4: George Harrison]
Been stuck in airports, terrorized
Sent to meetings, hypnotized
Overexposed, commercialized
Handle me with care
[Pre-Chorus: Roy Orbison]
I'm so tired of being lonely
I still have some love to give
Won't you show me that you really care?
[Chorus: Jeff Lynne and Roy Orbison]
Everybody's got somebody to lean on
Put your body next to mine, and dream on
[Verse 5: George Harrison]
I've been uptight and it made a mess
But I'll clean it up myself, I guess
Oh, the sweet smell of success
Handle me with care
