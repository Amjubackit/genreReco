[Verse]
Lead me, Lord, lead me
Keep me, oh, keep me
From wandering
Help me, Lord, help me
Teach me, oh, teach me
Your suffering
[Chorus]
I will walk the narrow way
The only road that will lead to life
And I will stay the narrow way
To see the face of the One I love
[Verse]
Lead me, Lord, lead me
Keep me, oh, keep me
From wandering
Help me, Lord, help me
Teach me, oh, teach me
Your suffering
[Chorus]
And I will walk the narrow way
The only road that will lead to life
And I will stay the narrow way
To see the face of the One I love
The One I love
[Bridge]
There is nothing in this life worth the cost of losing You
Is it even sacrifice if I trade the world for You?
You're the treasure, You're the prize
Jesus, only You, only You
There is nothing in this life worth the cost of losing You
Is it even sacrifice if I trade the world for You?
You're the treasure, You're the prize
Jesus, only You
[Chorus]
So, I will walk the narrow way
The only road that will lead to life
And I will stay the narrow way
To see the face of the One I love
Yes, I will walk the narrow way
The only road that will lead to life
And I will stay the narrow way
To see the face of the One I love
[Outro]
The One I love
The One I love
