[Verse 1]
Wasn't picture perfect, it was just a Tuesday
Wasn't nothin' special, just the same old same
No love songs on the radio playin'
You were just driving and holdin' my hand
No big plans, just you next to me
No sunset, no roses but I started feeling things
[Chorus]
At the third red light on La Ciénaga
You stole my heart right off of my lips
Think it just hit me when I started kissin' ya
I kinda might sorta like love you a little bit
Hands on me in your old T-Shirt
In your two-door Ford thinking those three words
Light turned green then it started sinking in
I kinda might, sorta like, love you a little bit
[Verse 2]
Caught up in the moment, went by so fast
Kinda scared to say it, what if you don't say it back?
Either way, I felt it, can't un-feel that
I ain't gonna lie it's a rеal weird time for stars to align
Last place I would think
I would start to fall I guеss I'll call it lowkey meant to be
[Chorus]
At the third red light on La Ciénaga
You stole my heart right from my lips
Think it just hit me when I started kissin' ya
I kinda might, sorta like, love you a little bit
Hands on me in your old T-Shirt
In your two-door Ford thinking those three words
Light turned green then it started sinking in
I kinda might, sorta like, love you a little bit
[Bridge]
I know that I told you that we should just be friends
But I don't think I can, not when I feel like this
Try to fight it but the truth is
I kinda might, sorta like, love you a little bit
[Chorus]
At the third red light at La Ciénaga
You stole my heart right from my lips
Think it just hit me when I started kissin' ya
I kinda might, sorta like, love you a little bit
Hands on me in your old T-Shirt
In your two-door Ford thinking those three words
Light turned green then it started sinking in
I kinda might, sorta like, love you a little bit
