[Chorus]
I just wanna let go, freefall
I don't wanna not trust no more
I just wanna let go, freefall
Catch me, baby, here I come (Oh)
Catch me, baby, here I come (Oh)
Catch me, baby, here I come (Oh)
Oh-oh, catch me baby, here I come
[Post-Chorus]
Catch me, catch me
Catch me, catch me
Catch me, catch me
Catch me, catch me
[Verse 1]
Here I go, taking chances
No more walls, heart's wide open
No disguise, I'm too transparent
In my eyes, you'll see my lessons
[Chorus]
I just wanna let go, freefall (I just want to fall)
I don't wanna not trust no more (I don't wanna not trust no more, I)
I just wanna let go, freefall (I just wanna free, yeah)
Catch me, baby, here I come (Oh)
Catch me, baby, here I come (Oh)
Catch me, baby, here I come (Oh)
Oh-oh, catch me baby, here I come
