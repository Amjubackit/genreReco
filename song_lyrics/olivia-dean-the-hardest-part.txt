[Verse 1]
Call me up to meet you, static on the phone
Normally I need you, this time, I don't wanna go
Lately I been growing into someone you don't know
You had the chance to love her, but apparently you don't
No, you don't
[Chorus]
So even if I could, wouldn't go back where we started
I know you're still waiting, wondering where my heart is
Pray that things won't change, but the hardest part is
You're realising maybe I, maybe I ain't the same
And what you're waiting for ain't there no more anyway
[Verse 2]
Held you up so highly, deep under your spell
Your opinions would define me, this time, I made some for myself
'Cause lately I been certain there's no further to go
Yeah, you had the chance to love me, but apparently you won't
No, you won't
[Chorus]
So even if I could, wouldn't go back where we started
I know you're still waiting, wondering where my heart is
Pray that things won't change, but the hardest part is
You're realising maybe I, maybe I ain't the same
And what you're waiting for ain't there no more anyway
[Bridge]
And it's okay
I'm not gonna remember you that way
You say I'm different now like that's so strange
But I was only eighteen
You shoulda known that I was always gonna change
[Chorus]
Even if I could, wouldn't go back where we started
I know you're still waiting, wondering where my heart is
Pray that things won't change, but the hardest part is
You're realising maybe I, maybe I ain't the same
Ain't there no more, I ain't there no more (I ain't there no more)
Ain't there no more, I ain't there no more (I ain't there no more)
Ain't there no more, but the hardest part is (I ain't there no more)
You're realising maybe I, maybe I ain't the same
And what you're waiting for ain't there no more anyway
