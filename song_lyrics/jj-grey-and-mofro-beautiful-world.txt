Bad blood, I could crawl right out my mind
It's a long day, long day when the sun won't shine
But it feels like, fussing and fighting is all we do
Lord knows I can't get enough of you
Bad blood, I could crawl right out of my mind
Ah girl, it's a new day now we can make it shine
Listen to the birds sing their song
Listen to my heart beating strong
I just want to feel like I do when I'm with you
It's a beautiful world
The darkness, it ain't so deep
So I reach and I reach and I reach higher
Set me free
Ah girl, it's a new day now we can make it shine
Listen to the birds sing their song
Listen to my heart beating strong
I just want to feel like I do when I'm with you
It's a beautiful world
Ah girl, it's a new day now we can make it shine
Listen to the birds sing their song
Listen to my heart beating strong
I just want to feel like I do when I'm with you
It's a beautiful world, beautiful world, oh beautiful world
