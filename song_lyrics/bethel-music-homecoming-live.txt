[Verse 1: Cory Asbury]
Lord, I confess
That I've been a criminal
I've stolen Your breath
And sang my own song
And Lord, I confess
That I'm far from innocent
These shackles I wear
Oh, I bought on my own
[Chorus: Cory Asbury]
These scarlet sins had a crimson cost
You nailed my debt to that old rugged cross
An empty slate, at the empty grave
Thank God that stone was rolled away
[Verse 2: Cory Asbury, Gable Price & Cory Asbury]
Lord, I confess
I've been a prodigal
Made for Your house
But I walked my own roads
Then Jesus came
He tore down my prison walls
Death came to life
When He called me by name
[Chorus: Gable Price & Cory Asbury]
Scarlеt sins had a crimson cost
You nailed my debt to that old rugged cross
An еmpty slate, at the empty grave
Thank God that stone was rolled–
Scarlet sins had a crimson cost
You nailed my debt to that old rugged cross
An empty slate, at the empty grave
Thank God that stone was rolled away
[Interlude: Cory Asbury]
And I can see it now
Smiling in Heaven, You and I, You and I
[Bridge: Cory Asbury, Gable Price & Cory Asbury]
And I see bright, crimson robes draped over the ashes
A wide, open tomb where there should be a casket
The children are singing, and dancing, and laughing
The Father is welcoming
This is our homecoming
Roses in bloom pushed up from the embers
Our rivers of tears flow from good times remembered
Families are singing, and dancing, and laughing
The Father is welcoming
This is our homecoming
Heaven joins in with a glorious sound
And the great cloud of witnesses all gather 'round
'Cause the ones that were lost are finally found
The Father is welcoming
This is our homecoming
[Chorus: Gable Price & Cory Asbury]
Scarlet sins had a crimson cost
You nailed my debt to that old rugged cross
An empty slate, at the empty grave
Thank God that stone was rolled–
[Refrain: Gable Price & Cory Asbury]
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
The Father is welcoming
This is our homecoming
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
The Father is welcoming
This is our homecoming
[Interlude: Cory Asbury]
Can you see it now?
Standing on the shores of Heaven
You and I, and our families
Singing, and dancing, and laughing
There's truly no place like home
Yeah
Jesus, You're so beautiful
Haha, see Him face to face
Can we sing that bridge together one last time?
"I see bright, crimson robes"
[Bridge: Cory Asbury, Gable Price & Cory Asbury, Gable Price]
I see bright, crimson robes draped over the ashes
A wide, open tomb where there should be a casket
The children are singing, and dancing, and laughing
The Father is welcoming
This is our homecoming
Roses in bloom, they pushed up from the embers
Our rivers of tears flow from good times remembered
Families are singing, and dancing, and laughing (Let's go)
The Father is welcoming (Come on)
This is our homecoming
And Heaven joins in with a glorious sound
And the great cloud of witnesses all gather 'round
'Cause the ones that were lost are finally found
The Father is welcoming
This is our homecoming
[Chorus: Gable Price & Cory Asbury]
Scarlet sins had a crimson cost
You nailed my debt to that old rugged cross
An empty slate, at the empty grave
Thank God that stone was rolled–
[Outro: Gable Price & Cory Asbury]
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
The Father is welcoming
This is our homecoming
