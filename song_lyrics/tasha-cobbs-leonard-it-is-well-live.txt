It ain't always easy
But I know that God is always good
He has never failed me
So I know He'll work it for my good
It is well
It is well
It is well
With my soul
Rain will fall in my life
But I know that it won't last always
The storm may seem to harm me
But I know it's bringing brighter days
It is well
Oh, it is
It is well
Oh, it is
It is well
Well with my soul
It is well
Ah, ooh
It is well with meWhatever
Ooh
It is well with me
Through my struggles
It is well with me
Through my struggles
It is well with me
Through sickness and suffering
It is well with me
Through sickness and suffering
It is well with me
I am more than a conqueror
It is well with mе
I am more than a conqueror
It is well
Wеll, with my soul
It is well
It is well
It is well
