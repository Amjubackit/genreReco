Ohhh ohhh
Ooow hooow ohhh
Lord I try so hard to be
The best that I can be
Its like every time I take one step
Something right in front of me
Lord where would I be
With out your grace and mercy
Now I have one question, Lord why me
You changed my whole life ohhh you
You made my wrongs right
And for the rest of my life I'll never know why
You made something out of nothing
Ohhh nothing nothing nothing
You made something out of nothing
You spoke and I was so
Why Ill never know
My life was headed out of control
Some how I shifted in to overload
But then you came
And did a work in me (yeah yeah yeah)
Out of everything I once was some how you saw a masterpiece
You change my whole life
You made my wrongs rights (I never know why)
And for the rest of my life I'll never know why
You made something out of nothing
