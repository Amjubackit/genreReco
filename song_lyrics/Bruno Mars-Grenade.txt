[Verse 1]
Easy come, easy go
That's just how you live, oh
Take, take, take it all but you never give
Should a known you was trouble
From the first kiss
Had your eyes wide open, why were they open?
[Pre-Chorus]
(
Ooh-ooh
)
Gave you all I had, and you tossed it in the trash
(
Ooh-ooh
)
You tossed it in the trash, you did
(
Ooh-ooh
)
To give me all your love is all I ever ask 'cause
[Chorus]
What you don't understand is I'd catch a grenade for ya
 (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Throw my hand on a blade for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'd jump in front of a train for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You know I'd do anything for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh
I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes, I would die for ya, baby
But you won't do the same
