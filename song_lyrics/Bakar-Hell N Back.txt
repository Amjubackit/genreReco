[Chorus]
Could you tell where my head was at when you found me?
Me and you went to hell and back just to find peace
Man, I thought I had everything, I was lonely
Now you're my everything, I was lonely
[Verse 1]
I mixed a lot of love with a lot of drugs, then I found you
She liked petty crimes, she had 
green eyes like Mountain Dew
And where she go, I'll never know, her friends bounced too
I guess it's their loss 'cause they'll never know what we'll amount to
Would you be my light, be my yellow?
P.Y.T. walking down Portobello
Put a smile on this face at the end of the day
MDMA helped us fly away
Who'd have known, who'd have known you would save my life?
Who'd have known, who'd have known you would fly my kite?
Could you tell, could you tell?
Could you tell, could you tell?
[Chorus]
Could you tell where my head was at when you found me?
Me and you went to hell and back just to find peace
Man, I thought I had everything, I was lonely
Now you're my everything, I was lonely
