[Verse 1]
I already feel like doing it again, honey
'Cause once you know, then you know
And you don't wanna go
Back to wherever it is that you come from, yeah
[Refrain]
I just want to stay high with you
[Verse 2]
'Cause where I come from
Everybody frowns and walks around
With that ugly thing on their face
And where I come from
We work hard and grind and hustle all day
(Yes, we do)
There comes a time, there comes a time
At night where we get to play
And we smile and laugh and jump and clap
And yell and holler and just feel great
[Refrain]
I just want to stay high with you
With you, with you, baby
[Verse 3]
So don't question my state of mind
I'm doing wonderful, just fine, thank you
(Thank you)
Everything is everything and everything is beautiful
(How did you get like that?)
See, all I do is keep it cool and don't worry 'bout what everyone is doing
I already feel like doing it again, honey
