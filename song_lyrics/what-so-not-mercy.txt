[Verse 1: MØ]
You got the look in your eyes
I know I fucked up one too many times
When I was on my selfish shit
I thought no matter what I did you'd stay with me
I never in a million years imagined
You would really walk away from me
[Chorus: MØ]
I need mercy, I'm begging you please
You know I can't sleep without you (Ooh)
So tell me it's all a bad dream
'Cause I just can't be without you (Ooh)
I'm the perfect fool
I was blind, baby please I need
Mercy, I'm down on my knees
You know I can't see without you (Ooh)
[Verse 2: MØ]
No, babe, I never were easy to love (Love, love)
I'm a sweet mess with permanеnt sunglasses on (On, on)
And I know
I know I've been so selfish, shit
I thought no mattеr what I did, you'd stay with me (Stay)
Oh, baby I'm terrified of growing up
Admitting and committing
Oh, but please don't, please don't go[Chorus: MØ]
I need mercy, I'm begging you please
You know I can't sleep without you (Ooh)
So, tell me it's all a bad dream
'Cause I just can't be without you (Ooh)
I'm the perfect fool
I was blind, baby please I need
Mercy, I'm down on my knees
You know I can't see without you (Ooh)
[Bridge: MØ]
I got out of control
I know I should have listened to you
Listened to you long ago
I'm paranoid of hope
I guess I thought I wanted to be on my own
But hell no, hell no
So, stay with me
So, stay with me
[Chorus: MØ]
I swear I need mercy, I'm begging you please
You know I can't sleep without you (Ooh)
So, tell me it's all a bad dream
'Cause I just can't be without you (Ooh)
I'm the perfect fool
I was blind, baby please I need
Mercy, I'm down on my knees
You know I can't see without you (Ooh)[Outro: MØ]
Ooh, ooh
Mercy, mercy, mercy, mercy
Ooh
Mercy, mercy, mercy, mercy
