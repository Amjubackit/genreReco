[Verse 1]
I tried so hard to be the person
Everybody thought I was
I pushed myself and everyone
Almost over the edge
This mirrored light that sends back
Everything that you send out
The grace you give, given back
Loving every minute you live
[Chorus]
Feels so good to be warm - in the sun
Loving every minute of living
So good to be warm - in the sun
Loving every minute of living
[Verse 2]
The evil deeds that we do
Screaming from the headline
Can't stop to read, or to watch
’Cause I ain’t got the patience or time
To live a life of despair
To live by another man’s word
It’s always been in your hands
To live the life you want while you’re here
Oh[Chorus]
Feels so good to be warm - in the sun
Loving every minute of living
So good to be warm - in the sun
Loving every minute of living
[Bridge]
I don’t care, what you say to me
Everywhere beauty is all I see
And it don’t make a damn
’Cause there ain’t nothing to take from me
I’m loving every minute
I’m loving every minute I’m free
[Chorus]
So good to be warm - in the sun
Loving every minute of living
It’s so good to be warm - in the sun
Loving every minute I’m living
Good to be warm - in the sun
Loving every minute I’m living
Good to be warm - in the sun
Loving every minute I’m living
[Outro]
Loving every minute
Loving every minute I’m free
