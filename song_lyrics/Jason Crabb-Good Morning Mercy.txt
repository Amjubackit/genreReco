[Verse 1]
While I was sleeping, Lord, You were working
On a mess I made like only I can do
When I start thinking I'm so far from You
I wake up to hear You whisper, "That's not true"
[Chorus]
Good morning, mercy
You call me worthy
Feels like the sun shining on my face
Living's good this side of grace
I feel it working
Goodbye to the hurting
You woke me up, put me on my way
Hallelujah, it's a brand new day
Good morning, mercy
[Verse 2]
Yeah, I'm still learning to trust and follow
I won't worry what tomorrow's gonna bring
'Cause You hold it all there in Your hands
I'm lifting mine up now 'cause it makes me sing
[Chorus]
Good morning, mercy
You call me worthy
Feels like the sun shining on my face
Living's good this side of grace
I feel it working
Goodbye to the hurting
You woke me up, put me on my way
Hallelujah, it's a brand new day
Good morning, mercy
