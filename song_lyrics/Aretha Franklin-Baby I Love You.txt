If you want my lovin'
If you really do
Don't be afraid baby
Just ask me
You know I'm gonna give it to you
Oh and I do declare (I do)
I wanna see you with it
Stretch out your arms little boy
You're gonna get it
'Cause I love you
(Baby, baby baby I love you)
Ain't no doubt about it
Baby I love you
(Baby, baby baby I love you)
I love you I love you
I love you, I love you
Baby I love you
If you feel you wanna kiss me
Go right ahead I don't mind
All you got to do is
Snap your fingers
And I'll come runnin'
I ain't lyin' (I ain't lyin')
And I heard you once
Little boy you know you got it
I'd deny my own self
Before I see you without it
'Cause I love you
