[Verse 1]
If you wanna take a trip or two, I don't know
'Cause soon I'll keep you here with your coffin closed
'Cause the secrets that I'm keepin'
Ain't no good to me
Well you six feet under, all you hear are the cries
F
rom a long-bit chest on a widowed bride
From the screamin' tears are seething
This won't bother me
[Chorus]
I'm dead and gone
The way you do me wrong
And I'm dead and gone
The way you do me wrong
Oh baby look what you done
[Verse 2]
Chokin' on the saddles
Wouldn't want you to know
There's a warm place waitin' for you just below
When the grievin' tears are painting
This won't bother me
In the middle of the night, when you still hear the cries
Suffocation blues will bring you lullabies
Keep a sleepin' with the creepin'
Just wait and see[Chorus]
Dead and gone
The way you do me wrong
And I'm dead and gone
The way you do me wrong
Baby look what you done
[Hook]
'Til only now I can see
Words you don't hardly speak
It's getting harder and harder to breathe
No more killin' time
Eat you up inside
[Chorus]
I'm dead and gone
The way you do me wrong
I'm dead and gone
The way you do me wrong
Oh baby look what you done
Oh baby look what you done
Oh baby look what you done
Oh baby look what you done
Oh baby look what you
