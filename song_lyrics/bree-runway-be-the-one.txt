[Intro: Bree Runway & Khalid]
Da-da-da, la-da-da
La-da-da, oh-oh-oh
[Verse 1: Bree Runway, 
Khalid
]
No, I can't slip away in the night
Maybe someday, you'd meet me in the deep end
Hear the voices in my head decide
And you know, I just needed a reason
[Pre-Chorus: Bree Runway, 
Khalid
, 
Bree Runway & Khalid
]
Should I lay down and die (
Yeah, yeah
)
Without you by my side? (
Yeah, yeah
)
Can you hear me cry (
Yeah, yeah
)
All the things you've said? (
Yeah, yeah, yeah
)
And then you tell me that
 
I can't get away from the pain
When it's starin' in my face
[Chorus: Bree Runway & Khalid]
I can see the tears in your eyes when you look in mine
Told you for the thousandth time, you should be the one for me
Should I stay here tonight? Baby, you decide
Hopin' you'd be the one, you, you could be the one
[Post-Chorus: Bree Runway & Khalid, 
Bree Runway
]
You could be, be the one, you could be (You could be the one)
Be the one, you could be[Verse 2: Khalid, 
Bree Runway
, 
Bree Runway & Khalid
]
You don't seem so far when you're away from me
What you've done for me, all the memories (
All that you've done
)
When we're far apart and you're not here with me
Need your company like the air I breathe
 (
All that you've done
)
[Pre-Chorus: Bree Runway, 
Khalid
, 
Bree Runway & Khalid
]
Should I lay down and die (
Yeah, yeah
)
Without you by my side? (
Yeah, yeah
)
Can you hear me cry (
Yeah, yeah
)
All the things you've said? (
Yeah, yeah, yeah
)
And then you tell me that
 
I can't get away from the pain
When it's starin' in my face
[Chorus: Bree Runway & Khalid, 
Bree Runway
]
I can see the tears in your eyes when you look in mine
Told you for the thousandth time, you should be the one for me
Should I stay here tonight? Baby, you decide
Hopin' you'd be the one, you, you could be the one
I can see the tears in your eyes when you look in mine
Told you for the thousandth time, you should be the one for me
Should I stay here tonight? (
Stay here tonight
) Baby, you decide
Hopin' you'd be the one (
One
), you, you could be the one
[Post-Chorus: Bree Runway & Khalid, 
Bree Runway
]
You could be, be the one, you could be (
The one
, you could be the one)
Be the one, you could be (
You could be the one, yeah
)
Be the one, you could be (You could be the one, 
the one
)
Be the one, you could be[Outro: Bree Runway & Khalid, 
Bree Runway

Can't ignore the feelings that I
You should know, thousand times
Can't ignore the feelings that I
You should know, thousand times
Can't ignore the feelings that I
You should know, thousand times
Can't ignore the feelings that I
You should know, thousand times
You should know, you should know, oh-oh
