[Verse 1]
There were moments of dreams
I was offered to save
I lived less like a workhorse
More like a slave
I thought that one quick moment
That was noble or brave
Would be worth the most of my life
So I pointed my fingers
And shouted few quotes I knew
As if something that's written
Should be taken as true
But every path I had taken
And conclusion I drew
Would put truth back under the knife
[Pre-Chorus 1]
And now the only piece of advice that continues to help
Is anyone that's making anything new only breaks something else
[Chorus]
When my time comes
Oh oh oh oh
When my time comes
Oh oh oh oh[Verse 2]
So I took what I wanted
And put it out of my reach
I wanted to pay for my successes
With all my defeats
And if Heaven was all
That was promised to me
Why don't I pray for death?
Now it seems like the unravelling
Has started too soon
Now I'm sleeping in hallways
And I'm drinking perfume
And I'm speaking to mirrors
And I'm howling at moons
While the worse and the
Worse that it gets
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh you can judge the whole world on the sparkle that you think it lacks
Yes, you can stare into the abyss, but it's staring right back
[Chorus]
When my time comes
Oh oh oh oh
When my time comes
Oh oh oh oh[Instrumental Bridge]
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Well you can judge the whole world on the sparkle that you think it lacks
Yes, you can stare into the abyss, but it's staring right back
[Chorus]
When my time comes
Oh oh oh oh
When my time comes
Oh oh oh oh
When my time comes
Oh oh oh oh
