[Intro]
Hail, hail, the black sheep
We are blood, we are family
[Verse 1]
Call me an outcast, call me a freak
Watch those bullets ricochet straight off of me
'Cause I belong
Where right is wrong
No lost cause like the good book say
Don't give a damn what people think
I march alone
To a different song
[Pre-Chorus]
Whoa, I feel it deep in my bones
I was born to break
Every curse, every chain
So I'm singin'
[Chorus]
Hail, hail, the black sheep
We are blood, we are family
Pray the Lord my soul to keep
Hail, hail, the black sheep
Thicker than water, thick as thieves
Oh, how thе river runs deep
We are blood, wе are family
Hail, hail, the black sheep
