[Intro]
Hail, hail, the black sheep
We are blood, we are family
[Verse 1]
Call me an outcast, call me a freak
Watch those bullets ricochet straight off of me
'Cause I belong
Where right is wrong
No lost cause like the good book say
Don't give a damn what people think
I march alone
To a different song
[Pre-Chorus]
Whoa, I feel it deep in my bones
I was born to break
Every curse, every chain
So I'm singin'
[Chorus]
Hail, hail, the black sheep
We are blood, we are family
Pray the Lord my soul to keep
Hail, hail, the black sheep
Thicker than water, thick as thieves
Oh, how thе river runs deep
We are blood, wе are family
Hail, hail, the black sheep
[Verse 2]
Can't shut me up, won't bite my tongue
Speak my truth 'til the day is done
I'm not ashamed (I'm not ashamed)
I own my pain
Never was lost, but I found my way
Always knew I'd show my scars one day
For the rules I broke
Helped me build my throne
[Pre-Chorus]
Whoa, and I'm right where I belong
Now I'm singin'
[Chorus]
Hail, hail, the black sheep
We are blood, we are family
Pray the Lord my soul to keep
Hail, hail, the black sheep
Thicker than water, thick as thieves
Oh, how the river runs deep
We are blood, we are family
Hail, hail, the black sheep
[Bridge]
Hail
The black sheep, yeah
Hail
The black sheep, oh yeah
From the streets to the gutters
We're sisters and brothers
One nation under one love, one color
Born to be (Black sheep!)
[Chorus]
Hail, hail, the black sheep
We are blood, we are family
Pray the Lord my soul to keep
Hail, hail, the black sheep
Thicker than water, thick as thieves
Oh, how the river runs deep
We are blood, we are family
Hail, hail, the black sheep
[Outro]
From the streets to the gutters
We're sisters and brothers
We are blood, we are family
Hail, hail, the black sheep
