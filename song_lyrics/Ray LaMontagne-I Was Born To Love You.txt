[Verse 1]
You give me a sign
You give me a lift
You take me home when I've done my shift
You give me a loan
When I'm stone cold broke
Get me high, when I need a toke
[Chorus]
I was born to love
I was born to love
I was born to love
I was born to
[Verse 2]
Times were tough
We made it through
We tasted the rough
So let's save the spoon
All the time I was hurtin' you
Got to believe that I was hurtin' too
[Chorus]
I was born to love
I was born to
Born to love
I was born to
