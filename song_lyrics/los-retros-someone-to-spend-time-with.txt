[Verse 1: Los Retros]
Wake up alone
In the morning with no one at my side
Could it be
I’ve waited too long
Waiting for the lucky one
[Chorus: Los Retros]
My sweetheart, where are you?
I need someone to spend time with
To give and share all my love
[Verse 2: Firelordmelissa]
Back in bed
It’s 3 a.m
With no one at my side
It gets real cold
Because these blankets
Will never warm my heart
[Chorus: Finelordmelissa, Los Retros & both]
My sweetheart, where are you?
I need someone to spend time with
To give and share all my love
My sweetheart, where are you?
I need someone to spend time with
To give and share all my love
My sweetheart, where are you?
I need someone to spend time with
To give and share all my love
