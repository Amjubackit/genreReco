(written by John Prine)
I am an old woman
Named after my mother
My old man is another
Child that's grown old
If dreams were thunder
And lightnin' was desire
This old house would have burnt down
A long time ago
Make me an angel, that flies from Montgomery
Make me a poster, of an old rodeo
Just give me one thing, Lord , that I can hold onto
To believe in this living is just a hard way to go
When I was a young girl
I had me a cowboy
He wasn't much to look at
Just a free ramblin' man
Oh, but that was such a long time
And no matter how I try
Those years they just flow by
Like a broken-down damMake me an angel, that flies from Montgomery
Make me a poster, of an old rodeo
Just give me one thing, I can hold onto
To believe in this living is just a hard way to go
There's flies in the kitchen
I can hear all their buzzin'
But I ain't done nothin
Since I woke up today
How the hell can a person
Go to work in the morning
And come home in the evening
And have nothin' to say?
Make me an angel, that flies from Montgomery
Make me a poster of an old rodeo
Just give me one thing I can hold onto
To believe in this living is just a hard way to go
