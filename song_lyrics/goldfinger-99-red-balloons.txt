[Intro]
You and I in a little toy shop
Buy a bag of balloons with the money we've got
Set them free at the break of dawn
'Til one by one they were gone
Back at base, bugs in the software
Flash the message, "Something's out there"
Floatin' in the summer sky
Ninety-nine red balloons go by
[Interlude]
[Verse 1]
Ninety-nine red balloons
Floatin' in the summer sky
Panic bells, it's red alert
There's somethin' here from somewhere else
The war machine, it springs to life
Opens up one eager eye
And focusin' it on the sky
As ninety-nine red balloons go by
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 2]
99 Decision Street
Ninety-nine ministers meet
To worry, worry, super scurry
Call out the troops now in a hurry
This is what we've waited for
This is it, boys, this is war
The President is on the line
As ninety-nine red balloons go by
[Interlude]
[Bridge]
Neunundneunzig Kriegsminister
Streichholz und Benzinkanister
Hielten sich füare schlaue Leute
Witterten schon fette Beute
Riefen: Krieg und wollten Macht
Mann, wer hätte das gedacht?
Daß es einmal so weit kommt
Wegen neunundneunzig Luftballons
[Guitar Solo]
Neunundneunzig Luftballons
[Outro]
Ninety-nine dreams I have had
In every one, a red balloon
It's all over, and I'm standin' pretty
In the dust that was a city
If I could find a souvenir
Just to prove the world was here
Then here it is, a red balloon
I think of you and let it go
