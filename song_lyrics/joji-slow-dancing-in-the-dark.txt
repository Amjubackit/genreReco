[Verse 1]
I don't want a friend (Just one more night)
I want my life in two (My life in two)
Please
 one more night
Waiting to get there
Waiting for you (Waiting for you)
Just 
one more

I'm done 
fighting
 all 
night
[Pre-Chorus 1]
When I'm around slow dancing in the dark
Don't follow me, you'll end up in my arms
You done made up your mind
I don't need no more signs
Can you?
Can you?
[Chorus]
Give me reasons we should be complete
You should be with him, I can't compete
You looked at me like I was someone else, oh well
Can't you see? (Can't you see?)
I don't wanna slow dance (I don't wanna slow dance)
In the dark, dark
[Verse 2]
When you gotta run
Just hear my voice in you (My voice in you)
Shutting me out you (Shutting me out)
Doing so great (So great, so great)
You
