[Verse 1]
Ready or not
Here comes the weekend
I'll be walkin' around, talkin' a lot
Lord knows I don't need a reason
To tell myself I'll be alright
I hope that it's true
I'm already out for the night
Why not make it two?
[Verse 2]
My God, ready or not
Here comes the wedding
You wear the white, I'll say why not (I'm so excited)
You're always forgetting
To tell ourselves we'll be alright
Let's hope it's true
You're already one of a kind
Why not make it two?
[Verse 3]
So I say ready or not
Here comes the funeral
You wear the black and I'll pick the plot
It's all so unusual
Saying we'll all be alright
And you know that ain't true
It's always a matter of time
What else can you do?
[Outro]
We're already telling a lie
Why not make it two?
