[Intro]
Yeah (Dun-dun-da-dun-dun-dun)
Yeah, okay, yeah
Check my sleeve, sauce I spit
Let me just talk my shit
Is it cold in here to you? Wet
Whoa Kenny
Lil' bitch, yeah
[Verse 1]
Big drip like spit from a big rip
Fendi on my collar, I'm a real rich prick (Wet)
Just like some extra pee, shake 'em off my dick (Ayy)
Too much sauce, broke my hip (Ayy, ayy)
Caution, you might need emergency kit (Ayy, ayy)
Coffin, anything I fuck with, RIP (RIP, RIP)
Feeling like a tongue, 'cause I'm moving like a lick (Ayy)
One thousand dollar shoes, same color Pickle Rick (Feelin' like a, feelin' like a)
Yohji Yamamoto
Diamonds like sudoku
Runnin' round the city in a toga eating noodles (Runnin' round the city in a)
Think I'm a star, chillin' near Pluto (Water)
Huh, huh, yeah, you knew though (You knew though)
I'm on a roll, just like a lobster (Look at it)
These niggas imposters
, acting like the coppers (Water)
My diamonds wetter than damn Davy Jones locker (Yeah, yeah)
Know Sir Ski Slump (Yup), bad motherfucker
