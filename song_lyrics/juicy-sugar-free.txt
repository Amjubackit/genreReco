[Intro]
My sugar is gone, I'm lonely everyday
Oh
Oh-oh, woah, woah
Hey, ayy, ayy
Oh, sugar
[Chorus]
I'm sugar free
In the night
I'm sugar free
In the day
[Verse 1]
My sweet honey had to go away
For a little while
And when my candy's not here with me
I'm a helpless child, yeah
[Chorus]
I'm sugar free (Oh)
In the night (So lonely, so lonely)
I'm sugar free (Hey, yeah)
In the day (So lonely)
[Verse 2]
I know he loves me, I know he cares
'Cause he's all mine
And soon he'll be knocking at my door
Things will be alright, yeah
[Chorus]
I'm sugar free (Ooh, oh)
In the night (So lonely, so lonely)
I'm sugar free (Hey, yeah, yeah)
In the day (So lonely, oh sugar)
I'm sugar free (Oh my sugar's gone, he's gone away)
In the night (Miss him every night and everyday, everyday)
I'm sugar free (Oh my sugar's gone, he's gone away)
In the day (Miss him every night, everyday)
Everyday, yeah
Ho, ho
Oh, sugar
Sugar's gone away from me, ho
My sugar is gone, I miss him everyday
[Instrumental Break]
[Interlude]
Oh, ho
Oh, ho-oh, ho
So lonely, babe
Ooh, ooh, oh, oh
So lonely, oh sugar
[Chorus]
I'm sugar free (Yeah)
In the night (So lonely, yeah)
I'm sugar free (Ooh, hoo)
In the day (So lonely, oh sugar)
I'm sugar free (Oh, my sugar's gone, he's gone away)
In the night (Miss him every night and everyday, everyday)
I'm sugar free (Oh my sugar's gone, he's gone away)
In the day (Miss him every night and everyday, everyday)
I'm sugar free (Yeah, oh, my sugar's gone, he's gone away, oh, woah)
In the night
