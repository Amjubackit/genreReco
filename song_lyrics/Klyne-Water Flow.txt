[Verse 1]
How about we
Go and let this
Thing behind ourselves
We've been through this
There's no need to
Hide away again
[Pre-Chorus]
We will go to the ocean
And we'll find love on the other side
And we'll take all our chances
Just as long as we're together
We can set sail to the night
[Chorus]
Flow water flow
Our worries go
Flow water flow
They sink down low
Flow water flow
Our worries go
Flow water flow
They sink down low
[Verse 2]
How about we
Move away from
All the hollow wells
I know we could
Try and make it
Worth our while again
