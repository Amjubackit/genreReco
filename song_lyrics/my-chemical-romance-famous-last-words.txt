[Intro]
Now, I know that I can't make you stay
But where's your heart?
But where's your heart?
But where's yourâ€”
And I know there's nothing I can say
To change that part
To change that part
To change
[Verse 1]
So many bright lights to cast a shadow
But can I speak?
Well, is it hard understanding
I'm incomplete?
A life that's so demanding
I get so weak
A love that's so demanding
I can't speak
[Chorus]
I am not afraid to keep on living
I am not afraid to walk this world alone
Honey, if you stay, you'll be forgiven
Nothing you can say can stop me going home
