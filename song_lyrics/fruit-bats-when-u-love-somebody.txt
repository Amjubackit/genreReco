Baby, remember on the bus
And my hand was on your knee?
When you love somebody
It's hard to think about anything but to breathe
Baby, I am the cub
Who was washed out in the flood
When you love somebody
Bite your tongue, all you get is a mouthful of blood
Okay
Baby, remember on the bus
And my hand was on your knee?
When you love somebody
It's hard to think about anything but to breathe
Baby, I am the cub
Who was washed out in the flood
When you love somebody
Bite your tongue, all you get is a mouthful of blood
Here we go
Baby, I am the cub
Who was washed out in the flood
When you love somebody
Bite your tongue, all you get is a mouthful of blood
When you love somebody
It's hard to think about anything but to breathe
When you love somebody
It's hard to think about anything but to breathe
When you love somebody
Bite your tongue, all you get is a mouthful of blood
When you love somebody
It's hard to figure out, hard to figure out
When you love somebody
It's hard to figure out, hard to figure out
When you love somebody
It's hard to think about anything but to breathe
