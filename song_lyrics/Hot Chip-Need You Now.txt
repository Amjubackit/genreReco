[Chorus: Sinnamon]
I need you now, need you now
Say it loud, I need you now
I need you now, need you now
Say it loud, I need you now
[Verse 1: Alexis Taylor]
Tired of being myself, caught up in this world
I never dreamed I could belong
To a state that don't see right from wrong
I never dreamed I would belong to your place
[Chorus: Sinnamon & 
Joe Goddard
]
I need you now, need you now
Say it loud, I need you now
I need you now (
In a place afar
), need you now (
In a place afar
)
Say it loud, I need you now
[Verse 2: Alexis Taylor]
Tied up in disgrace, how can we keep a man so long?
Waiting for a fate
 stripped to all our hearts
Never dreamed we would belong
In a world, a world that's just gone wrong
[Bridge: Al Doyle]
And if we try to stand alone
We'll be playing with a force beyond control
Our faces pressed against the glass
In the knowledge you belong to us
