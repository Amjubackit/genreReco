[Intro]
Hey
Hey
Hey
Hey
[Verse 1]
I could stick around and get along with you
Hello, oh-oh-oh
It doesn't really mean that I'm into you
Hello, oh-oh-oh
[Pre-Chorus]
You're alright, but I'm here, darling, to enjoy the party
Don't get too excited 'cause that's all you'll get from me, hey
Yeah, I think you're cute, but really you should know
[Chorus]
I just came to say hello
Hello, hello, hello, oh-oh-oh
[Verse 2]
I'm not the kinda girl to get messed up with you
Hello, oh-oh-oh
I'ma let you try to convince me to
Hello, oh-oh-oh
