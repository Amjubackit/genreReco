[Verse 1: Alex Ryan]
A little used, a little blush
A little frayed at the edge
Cut through, hit the rush
Let it flow to your head
I think I remember clearly now
Don’t slip, it’s a long way down
[Pre-Chorus: Marcus Leopard]
And I swear I never meant to go out
Out this way
[Chorus: Alex Ryan 
and
 
Marcus Leopard
]
Someone call a doctor, I don’t think I’m okay
Put your venom in my veins and 
take my pain away
Let down with nothing to say
Keep me coming back just to 
play your sick little games
[Verse 2: Alex Ryan]
Love the fall, love the lie
Love that look in your eyes
First we crawl, then we die
Just a matter of time
Arе you afraid of what you know
Don’t cry it keeps you cold[Pre-Chorus: Marcus Leopard]
And I swear I never mеant to go down
Down this way
[Chorus: Alex Ryan 
and
 
Marcus Leopard
]
Someone call a doctor, I don’t think I’m okay
Put your venom in my veins and 
take my pain away
Let down with nothing to say
Keep me coming back just to 
play your sick little games
Sick little games
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge: Alex Ryan]
Someone call a doctor I don't think I'm okay
Put your venom in my veins and take my pain away
[Chorus: Alex Ryan 
and
 
Marcus Leopard
]
Someone call a doctor, I don’t think I’m okay
Put your venom in my veins and 
take my pain away
Let down with nothing to say
Keep me coming back just to 
play your sick little games
[Outro: Alex Ryan]
Sick little games
