[Chorus]
I said, you want some?
Even though you never need it
Do you feel it, yeah?
I said, you want some?
Even though you never need it
Do you feel it, yeah?
[Verse]
But a-won't ya, ganja never hurt no one
Lord, you've got to kill off the one youth man
But a-won't ya, ganja never hurt no one
Lord, you've got to kill off the one youth man
You say now, girls and guns, guns and girls
Come together like the diamond and pearl
Only one, rule the world
Tryin' to tell me you're no ordinary girl
Woman, would you like to come quick?
I said now, woman, would you like to ride a little faster?
Woman, would you like to come quick?
Wouldn't you like it if we roll a little faster?
[Bridge]
Said, I'm going, going, back, back
All the way to Cali, Cali, that's where I wanna be
Said, I'm going, going, back, back
All the way to Cali, Cali, that's where I wanna be
Got five hundered clip, five hundered clips
And again I'm going to New York, New York
Got five thousand, five thousand clips
And then I'm going to New York, New York
And then I'm going, going, back, back
All the way to Cali, Cali, that's where I wanna be
Said, I'm going, going, back, back
All the way to Cali, Cali, that's where I wanna be[Chorus]
I said, you want some?
Even though you never need it
Do you feel it, yeah?
I said, you want some?
Even though you never need it
Do you feel it, yeah?
[Outro]
But a bandilero
But a bandilero
But a bandilero
But a bandilero
He come to shoot up they one, say no
