[Verse 1]
I got my head, but my head is unraveling
Can't keep control, can't keep track of where it's traveling
I got my heart, but my heart's no good
And you're the only one that's understood
I come along, but I don't know where you're taking me
I shouldn't go, but you're wrenching, dragging, shaking me
Turn off the sun, pull the stars from the sky
The more I give to you, the more I die
[Pre-Chorus]
And I want you
And I want you
And I want you
And I want you
[Chorus]
You are the perfect drug
The perfect drug
The perfect drug
You are the perfect drug
The perfect drug
The perfect drug
[Verse 2]
You make me hard when I'm all soft inside
I see the truth when I'm all stupid-eyed
Your arrow goes straight through my heart
Without you everything just falls apart
My blood wants to say hello to you
My fears want to get inside of you
My soul is so afraid to realize
(How very little there is left of me)[Pre-Chorus]
And I want you
And I want you
And I want you
And I want you!
[Chorus]
You are the perfect drug
The perfect drug
The perfect drug
You are the perfect drug
The perfect drug
The perfect drug
You are the perfect drug
The perfect drug
The perfect drug
You are the perfect drug
The perfect drug
The perfect drug
You are the perfect drug
The perfect drug
The perfect drug
You are the perfect drug
The perfect drug
The perfect drug[Bridge]
You are the perfect drug
The perfect drug
The perfect drug
You are the perfect drug
The perfect drug
The perfect drug
You are the perfect drug
The perfect drug
The perfect drug
[Drum Solo]
[Outro]
Take me with you
Take me with you
Take me with you
Take me with you
(Take me with you)
Without you
Without you everything falls apart
(Take me with you)
Without you
It's not as much fun to pick up the pieces
(Take me with you)
Without you
Without you everything falls apart
(Take me with you)
Without you
It's not as much fun to pick up the pieces
(Take me with you)
It's not as much fun to pick up the pieces
(Take me with you)
It's not as much fun to pick up the pieces
Without you
Without you everything falls apart
Without you
It's not as much fun to pick up the pieces
It's not as much fun to pick up the pieces
It's not as much fun to pick up the pieces
