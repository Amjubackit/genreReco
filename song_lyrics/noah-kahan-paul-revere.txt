[Verse 1]
County line, I'm countin' down
Mailboxes until my house
This place had a heartbeat in its day
Vail bought the mountains, and nothing was the same
Yes, the boys are drunk, the sun is high
Their license plates "Live Free or Die"
But it just ain't that simple, it never was
We'll drink 'til New Year's, then they'll leave me to clean up
[Chorus]
One day, I'm gonna cut it clear
Ride like Paul Revere
And, when they ask me who I am
I'll say, "I'm not from around here"
[Verse 2]
I'll leave before the road crew's out
Before those joggers, looking way too proud
And I'll turn up the music and I'll forget
Until it ends, that I'm not ready to let go yet
[Chorus]
One day, I'm gonna cut it clear
Ride like Paul Revere
And, when they ask me who I am
I'll just pretend I didn't hear
It's typical, I fear
Folks just disappear
And, when they ask me who I am
I'll say, "I'm not from around here"
[Post-Chorus]
I'll say, "I'm not from around here"
[Outro]
But I'm in my car, and I see the yard
The patch of grass where we buried the dog
And the world makes sense behind a chain-link fence
If I could leave, I would've already left
But I'm in my car, and I see the yard
And the patch of grass where we buried the dog
And the world makes sense behind a chain-link fence
If I could leave, I would've already left
I would've already left
