[Intro]
Do you wanna hear about last night?
Do you wanna hear about last night?
'Bout last night
My night, my life
My night
[Verse 1]
I was dancin' with two women to my music, uh
Sportin' some fine linens, things you can find in it
You know I was overseas, growin' my money trees
My life is an anime, young Miyazaki
[Pre-Chorus]
Then I wake up, gotta get back to the paper
Bands a maker dance, dollar and a dream
Money on my mind
[Chorus]
I'm a dancer, ChaCha smooth, pay the ransom
Learn the money dance, must learn the money dance
How it go again?
To the left, take it back now y'all
One hop this time (Cha)
One hop this time (ChaCha real smooth)
Now to the right, take it back now y'all
ChaCha real smooth
These are mula dreams, money dance (ChaCha real smooth)
Money things, money plans
Mula dreams, money dance
Money things, money plans
Mula dreams
