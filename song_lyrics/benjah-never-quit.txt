I’ve been tryin' to find a spot for a long time
Always seem like it comin on its own time
But it feels so good
Ain't gonna lie
My ride or die
Feels so good ain’t gonna lie
Na na last goodbye
All the way up and you can't take this
Cuz its feeling so real that you can't fake this
But it feels so good
Ain't gonna lie
My ride or die
Feels so good, ain't gonna lie
Na na last goodbye
We ain't never gonna quit
We ain't never gonna quit it boy
We ain't never gonna quit
Da da da we ain't never gonna quit it
Yeah I was trying to try mate
The temperature be rising
I coulda sworn that you’d be sidekick
You push my buttons I’m like Tyson
Been here since I felt like this
So blessed
Gonna ask if you can stay for the rest
Ima lie cuz i need you
Real joy in my life yeah, I need you, just be you
We ain't never gonna quit
We ain't never gonna quit it boy
We ain't never gonna quit
Da da da we ain't never gonna quit it
Every day’s a gift just take it as it comes
Embrace it through the mist
Wether rain or sun
Every day’s a gift
You got air up in your lungs
Be grateful rain or sun
Every day’s a gift just take it as it comes
Embrace it through the mist
Wether rain or sun
Every day’s a gift
You got air up in your lungs
Be grateful rain or sun
