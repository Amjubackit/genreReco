[Verse 1]
Let praise be a weapon that silences the enemy
And let praise be a weapon that conquers all anxiety
Let it rise, let praise arise
We sing Your name in the dark and it changes everything
We sing with all we are and we claim Your victory
Let it rise, let praise arise (Alright, come on now, here we go)
[Chorus]
We'll see You break down every wall
We'll watch the giants fall
Fear cannot survive when we praise You
The God of breakthrough's on our side
Forever lift Him high
With all creation cry, "God, we praise You"
Oh, we praise You
Oh (Alright, come on, let faith)
[Verse 2]
Let faith be the song that overcomes the raging sea
And let faith be the song that calms the storm inside of me
Let it rise, let faith arise
Let it rise
[Chorus]
We'll see You break down every wall
We'll watch the giants fall
Fear cannot survive when we praise You
The God of breakthrough's on our side
Forever lift Him high
With all creation cry, "God, we praise You" (Just sing)
Oh, we praise You
Oh (Alright, come on, this is)
[Bridge]
This is what living looks like
This is what freedom feels like
This is what Heaven sounds like
We praise You, we praise You (Come on, you sing)
This is what living looks like (Woo)
This is what freedom feels like
This is what Heaven sounds like
We praise You, we praise You (This is)
This is what living looks like
This is what freedom feels like
This is what Heaven sounds like
We praise You, we praise You
This is what living looks like
This is what freedom feels like
This is what Heaven sounds like
We praise You, we praise
[Chorus]
We'll see You break down every wall
We'll watch the giants fall
Fear cannot survive when we praise You
The God of breakthrough's on our side
Forever lift Him high
With all creation cry, "God, we praise You" (We're gonna see You break)
We'll see You break down every wall
We'll watch the giants fall
'Cause fear cannot survive when we praise You
The God of breakthrough's on our side
Forever lift Him high
With all creation cry, "God, we praise You" (Come on, with everything that you've got, come on, sing it now)
Oh, we'll tell Him tonight, we praise You
Oh, we praise You
Oh, we praise You
Oh, we praise You
[Interlude]
Come on, somebody, give Him a shout of praise
Come on, He's worthy
Yes, You're worthy of my wildest praise
I wanna get wild for You, yeah
There's no reason in holding it back tonight, oh
[Refrain]
I can't hold back my praise, I gotta let it out
I can't hold back my praise, I gotta let it out
I can't hold back my praise, come on, I gotta let it out
I can't hold back my praise, I gotta let it out
I can't hold back my praise (If there is anybody bursting with praise, tonight, come on sing), I gotta let it out
I can't hold back my praise, I gotta let it out
I can't hold back my praise, I gotta let it out
I can't hold back my praise, one more time, I gotta let it out
I can't hold back my praise, I gotta let it out
I can't hold back my praise (Now this is what living looks like, let's sing)
[Bridge]

Forever lift Him high
With all creation cry, "God, we praise You"
