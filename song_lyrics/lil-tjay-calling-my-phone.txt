[Chorus: Lil Tjay & Kid Kaleb, Lil Tjay]
Steady callin' my phone
I done told you before that it's over, leave me 'lone
Know it's hurtin' you to see me gone
Dark clouds, you gon' see me storm
I won't go back
But trust me, you're gon' hold that
Hold that (Mmm, mmm)
[Post-Chorus: Kid Kaleb]
Get you off my mind now
I can't get you off my mind now
I can't get you off my mind now
I can't get you off my mind now (Mmm, mmm) (yeah)
I can't get you off my mind now (yeah)
I can't get you off my mind now (yeah)
I can't get you off my mind now (yeah)
I can't get you off my mind now (Mmm, mmm) (Yeah-eah)
[Verse 1: Lil Tjay]
I ain't tryna play these games no more
I don't wanna be textin' your name no more
I ain't tryna feel this pain no more
And I'm sorry, but my feelings ain't the same no more (No)
Used to bе my homie, you ain't gang no more (No)
I am not a nigga you could claim no more (No)
Traumatizеd, hoping it don't rain no more
You done put me through some things that done changed my aura
Now all around the world, I explore, no Dora
New bitch, I might drip her in Dior
Ass fat, shawty straight heat, no Florida
Bad and she do it for herself, I applaud her
No needs, yeah, I'm talkin' my boo
So please, leave me alone I'm through
And it's all 'cause what you started
I been told you you gon' lose (Mmm)
[Chorus: Lil Tjay & Kid Kaleb, Lil Tjay, & 6LACK]
Steady callin' my phone (Brrt)
I done told you before that it's over, leave me 'lone
Know it's hurtin' you to see me gone
Dark clouds, you gon' see me storm
I won't go back (Go back)
But trust me, you're gon' hold that
Hold that (Mmm, mmm)

[Verse 2: Kid Kaleb]
Shorty hold my arrow tight
I'm gonna give you the time of your life
I got something to tell you, don't worry it'll all be alright
Just chill and relax, get it off your mind
You are forever all mine
Wiping the tears off your face
You look so beautiful when you kind
I was in darkness you turned on the light
We was so heartbroken so many people left us behind
Baby you make me so happy you treat me just right
I remember all those times people left me unopened
Never hittin' online
It get mad when I talk about music is [?]
Express myself whenever I'm using
Especially when somebody use me
I be dressed in the Designer, Louis and Gucci
Trust me everything is fine I've been better
People tell me that's a lie, it's just still a lie (aye)
And my life is horrible
Behind that blue-striped, the [?] story [?] is too long to write
Mmm, mmm-mmm-mmm
I'm in a [?]
[Post-Chorus: Kid Kaleb]
Get you off my mind now (uh)
I can't get you off my mind now (uh)
I can't get you off my mind now (uh)
I can't get you off my mind now (uh)
I can't get you off my mind now (uh)
I can't get you off my mind now (uh-uh)
I can't get you off my mind now (yeah)
I can't get you off my mind now
[Chorus: Lil Tjay & Kid Kaleb, Lil Tjay]
