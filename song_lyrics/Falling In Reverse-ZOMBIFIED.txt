[Intro]
Zombified
[Verse 1]
The monsters aren't living under your bed
'Cause they are the voices in your head
Zombified by the lies they've said
We've become the walking dead
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause everybody's talking that shâ€”
Oh no, they'll never let go
Of something you said ten years ago
They're canceling, canceling you
And they won't stop 'til everybody's
[Chorus]
Zombified (Zombified)
They're pumping us with lies
Like it's formaldehyde (Formaldehyde)
They're dead inside
It goes on and on, let this go
When it stops, we'll never know
We're hypnotized (Hypnotized)
And they won't stop 'til you're
Zombified
