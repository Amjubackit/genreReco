(Verse 1)
You met me deep in my despair
To show me you would never leave me there
You claimed because I was made for so much more
I am Your child and I'm worth fighting for
Though heavy with the weight of my mistakes
You carried me and refused to let me sink
Under the pressure, you meant for me to soar
I am Your child, and I'm worth fighting for
(Chorus)
Eyes haven't seen, ears haven't heard
All you have planned for me
And nothing can separate me from your love
When there's so much more still worth fighting for
(Verse 2)
Now I'm moving by faith and not by sight
Towards victory by the power of Your might
You're straightening out my past and opening every door
I am Your child and I'm worth fighting for
(Chorus - Choir) (x2)
Eyes haven't seen, ears haven't heard
All you have planned for me
And nothing can separate me from your love
When there's so much more still worth fighting for(Bridge)
That's why I'm pressing (it's worth it)
Towards the mark (so worth it)
Cause the calling on my life is worth fighting for
And I'll keep my mind (it's worth it)
Stayed on You Jesus (so worth it)
Because the peace it brings is worth fighting for
And I'll be faithful (it's worth it)
To my wife and children (so worth it)
Because my family is worth fighting for
No this world (it's worth it)
Is not my home (so worth it)
But Your kingdom here is worth fighting for
I got a mansion (it's worth it)
Over in glory (so worth it)
And my new home is worth fighting for
Til I see it I'll shout (it's worth it)
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Cause my praise is worth fighting for
Hallelujah (it's worth it)
Hallelujah (so worth it)
Hallelujah life with You is worth fighting
Hallelujah (it's worth it)
Hallelujah (so worth it)
Hallelujah life with You is worth fighting(Chorus)
Eyes haven't seen. Ears haven't heard
There is so much more still worth fighting for
Eyes haven't seen. Ears haven't heard
There is so much more still worth fighting for
(Interlude)
Hey, hey! If you believe that you're worth fighting for
Shout to the Lord
There is so much more still worth fighting for (hey hey)
There is so much more still worth fighting for
[Choir]
Eyes haven't seen. Ears haven't heard
There is so much more still worth fighting for (Speak to your Jesus right now)
Eyes haven't seen. Ears haven't heard
There is so much more still worth fighting for
(Outro)
Eyes haven't seen, ears haven't heard
All you have planned for me (Ya'll help me say that)
Eyes haven't seen, ears haven't heard
All you have planned for me (say one more time for me)
Eyes haven't seen, ears haven't heard
All you have planned for me
Eyes haven't seen. Ears haven't heard
All you have planned for me
There is so much more worth fighting forVictory is mine, Victory is mine
Victory today is mine, I told you
