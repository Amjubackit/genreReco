[Verse 1]
It's a long drive, long way
Go anywhere in the world despite the way
Baby, I don't mind the way
You got the same door, new paint
Make it worthwhile when I hold you now and again
Can I hold you now and again?
[Chorus]
'Cause, baby, I'm lost in the real estate (Yeah)
Of your mind, it's my favorite place
I'm buyin' my old space (Woo)
Tear it down just to renovate
I'm lost in the real estate (Yeah)
Of your mind, it's my favorite place
I'm buyin' my old space (Woo)
Tear it down just to renovate, yeah
[Verse 2]
It's been a long time, long day
Spend anything on you despite the change
Baby, I don't mind the change
You got the same floor, new stain
Make it worthwhile when I see you now and again
Can I see you now and again?
[Chorus]
'Cause, baby, I'm lost in the real estate (Yeah)
Of your mind, it's my favorite place
I'm buyin' my old space (Woo)
Tear it down just to renovate
I'm lost in the real estate (Yeah)
Of your mind, it's my favorite place
I'm buyin' my old space (Woo)
Tear it down just to renovate, yeah
[Outro]
(Oh yeah, oh yeah)
(Tear it down just to renovate, yeah)
(Oh yeah, oh yeah)
(Tear it down just to renovate)
(Renovate)
