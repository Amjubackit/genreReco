[Intro]
Yeah, huh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Huh? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hahaha
I ain't doin' no playing Jack, you hear me?
Yeah, yeah, hrrroww
Bow, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[Chorus]
I'm tired of him breathing, I'm taking his breath (Huh?)
Shoot to my right, my flag on the left
I earned my stripes but I'm not a ref
These niggas, they woke, they overslept (Yeah)
My bitch, she clutch because she a nurse
Whenever I'm down she give me a perc
The police pull up, my gun in her purse
The ops pull up, put him on a shirt
Bitch, we came in this world and we lookin' for murder
Knock yo cap off and it's word to Bobby Shmurda
Nigga watch yo mouth, I would hate to have to hurt ya
You would kill off a perc but snitch when you sober
Man down in the street, man, this nigga tried to play me
I hit one in the head but his gun was on safety
They askin' how I been, what I been feelin' lately
I got good aim in the pocket like I'm Brady
