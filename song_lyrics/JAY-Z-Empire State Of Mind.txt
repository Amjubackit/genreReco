[Intro: JAY-Z]
Yeah
[Verse 1: JAY-Z & 
Alicia Keys
]
Yeah, I'm out that Brooklyn, now I'm down in Tribeca
Right next to De Niro,
 
but I'll be hood forever
I'm the new Sinatra, and since I made it here
I can make it anywhere, yeah, they love me everywhere
I used to cop in Harlem, hola, my Dominicanos (
DÃ­melo!
)
Right there up on Broadway, brought me back to that McDonald's
Took it to my stash spot, 560 State Street
Catch me in the kitchen, like a Simmons whippin' pastry
Cruisin' down 8th Street, off-white Lexus
Drivin' so slow, but BK is from Texas
Me? I'm out that Bed-Stuy, home of that boy Biggie
Now I live on Billboard and I brought my boys with me
Say "What up?" to Ty Ty, still sippin' Mai Tais
Sittin' courtside, Knicks and Nets give me high fives
Nigga, I be spiked out (
Come on
), I could trip a referee (
Come on
)
Tell by my attitude (
Come on
) that I'm most definitely from
[Chorus: Alicia Keys & 
JAY-Z
]
In New York (
Ayy
, uh, yeah; 
aha
)
Concrete jungle 
(
Yeah
) where dreams are made of
There's nothin' you can't do 
(
Yeah
, okay)
Now you're in New York 
(
Aha, aha, aha
; uh, yeah)
These streets will make you feel brand-new (
New
)
Big lights will inspire you (
Come on
) (Okay)
Let's hear it for New York (
You welcome, OG
;
 uh)
New York (Yeah), New York (Uh, 
I made you hot, nigga
)
