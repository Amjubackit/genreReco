I never thought you would be here for this long
I never thought I would be here when you're gone
I never thought you would be here for this long
I never thought I would be here when you're gone
I never thought
I never thought you would be here for this long
I never thought I would be here when you're gone
I never thought
I never thought
I never thought
I never thought
It's 3 a.m. and you're back home, now where's your money gone?
Another late night without a ride home, it's just been too long
Just lock your doors, turn on your lights
Look into the mirror on a Saturday night
I know you're scared
And just like that...
I never thought you would be here for this long
I never thought I would be here when you're gone
I never thought
I never thought
