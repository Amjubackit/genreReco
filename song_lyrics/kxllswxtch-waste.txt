[Intro]
Once upon a time was a fool who thought he'd find
Hoo, hoo
[Chorus]
Once upon a time was a fool who thought he'd find
Purpose in his life along the way
Don't you run and hide from the truth you desire
Everything that lives is gone to waste
[Bridge]
Hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo
[Chorus]
Once upon a time was a fool who thought he'd find
Purpose in his life along the way
Don't you run and hide from the truth you desire
Everything that lives is gone to waste
