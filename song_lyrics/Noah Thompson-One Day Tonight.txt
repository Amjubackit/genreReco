[Verse 1]
Now and then after work on Friday nights
She'll lean in to a bottle of wine
And I just sit (I just sit), watch her talk about forever
Gotta admit, it might be my favorite thing ever
[Pre-Chorus]
When her eyes fill up with stars (Stars)
Yeah, and her dreams pour out her heart
[Chorus]
She wants a wedding in September, save up all winter
Spend our summers in a fixer-upper in Denver
She wants a girl and a boy and an old dog named Ol' Roy
Lord, I hope this old boy can give her that life
So go on, girl, well, pour a glass of winе
And dream aloud, talk about one day tonight
(One day tonight)
[Verse 2]
Shе lights up like a ten-foot Christmas tree
Dreaming up (Dreaming up) how our holidays will be
Already knows (Already knows) where we'll be in thirty years
Lord, I hope it's from her lips to God's ears
[Chorus]
She wants a honeymoon in Vegas, front yard Hydrangeas
Already knows the places we'll be taking vacations
She wants a boy and a girl with my eyes and her curls
Lord, I hope this old boy can give her that life
So go on, girl, well, pour a glass of wine
And dream aloud, talk about one day tonight
