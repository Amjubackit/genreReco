[Intro]
Hmmmm
Hmm-mm-mm-hmmm-mm
Hmm-mm-hmm-mm
[Verse 1]
Blood on my hands, what’s done is done
Left you by the road with the crows in the dust
Heart so hollow, deep as a cave
One day I’ll be dancin' on your grave
Takin' it back, the life you stole
Every little piece you took of my soul
Now I lay you down to sleep
And I pray with the Devil you rest in peace
[Chorus]
You can’t hang your chains on me (On me)
When you're six feet deep
This heart ain’t yours to bleed (To bleed)
Now that yours no longer beats
Hallelujah, I’m over you, yeah
I buried you, oh Lord, you're dead to me
Rest in peace
[Verse 2]
Black umbrella in the pourin' rain
No preacher, no prayer to cry your name
A little too late to right your wrongs
No one's layin' roses on your bones
No tears, no lovin' memories
Long is the road outta hell and the misery
So by my decree
[Chorus]
You can’t hang your chains on me (On me)
When you're six feet deep
This heart ain’t yours to bleed (To bleed)
Now that yours no longer beats
Hallelujah, I’m over you, yeah
I buried you, oh Lord, you're dead to me
Rest in peace, oh yeah
[Bridge]
(Ahhh!)
You can’t hurt me now
Can’t hold me down
What’s done is done
You can’t hurt me now
Can’t hold me down
I’ve had enough
Oh Lord, you're dead to me
So I lay you down, I lay you down to sleep
[Chorus]
You can’t hang your chains on me (On me)
When you're six feet deep
This heart ain’t yours to bleed
Now that yours no longer beats
Hallelujah, I’m over you, yeah
I buried you, oh Lord, you're dead to me
(Rest in peace, rest in peace, rest in peace)
Lord, you’re dead to me, yeah
(Rest in peace, rest in peace, rest in peace)
[Outro]
Rest in peace
Oh-oh, rest in peace
