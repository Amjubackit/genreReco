[Intro: Jenna G]
'Nother
'Nother

[Verse 1: Sam Smith]
You lift my heart up when the rest of me is down
You, you enchant me even when you're not around
If there are boundaries, I will try to knock them down
I'm latching on, babe, now I know what I have found
[Pre-Chorus: Sam Smith]
I feel we're close enough
I wanna lock in your love
I think we're close enough
Could I lock in your love, baby?
[Chorus: Sam Smith]
Now I've got you in my space
I won't let go of you
Got you shackled in my embrace
I'm latching on to you
Now I've got you in my space
I won't let go of you
Got you shackled in my embrace
I'm latching on to you
