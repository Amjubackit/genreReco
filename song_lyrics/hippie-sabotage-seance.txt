[Intro]
Oh oh oh-oh oh oh
Oh oh oh-oh oh oh oh-oh
Oh oh oh-oh oh oh
Oh oh oh-oh oh oh oh-oh
[Verse 1]
No more lawyer fees, and no more litigation
Had to sign a deal with no hesitation
How I'm feeling is impossible to measure
Went through so much pain to finally get to pleasure
[Chorus]
I don't trust a fucking soul, I learned my lesson
Now I'm charged up like a fucking lethal weapon
People tell me it's my time, it's now or never
All I tell 'em is that legends last forever
'Cause I ain't even lost a step it's been a decade
Changed a million things but never switched the message
I ain't working all my life for it not to pay off
I put these people in a trance like it's a séance
I ain't even lost a step it's been a decade
Changed a million things but never switched the message
I ain't working all my life for it not to pay off
I put these people in a trance like it's a séance[Verse 2]
I've got fools forgivenesse, for granting the Devil's wishes
They'll try to twist your vision 'til you get lost seeking vengeane
I know my younger self wouldn't recognize my resemblance
I've got danger senses, survivor's intuition
That's why
[Chorus]
I don't trust a fucking soul, I learned my lesson
Now I'm charged up like a fucking lethal weapon
People tell me it's my time, it's now or never
All I tell 'em is that legends last forever
'Cause I ain't even lost a step it's been a decade
Changed a million things but never switched the message
I ain't working all my life for it not to pay off
I put these people in a trance like it's a séance
I ain't even lost a step it's been a decade
Changed a million things but never switched the message
I ain't working all my life for it not to pay off
I put these people in a trance like it's a séance
