[Verse 1]
A night train, midnight, bags gathered round my feet
Possessions, some lessened to carry with me
Heavy and soothing like a gentle symphony
I rest my head right back upon my seat
It's hard and cold, though the best thing for me
This train is moving, but my heart is stationary
[Chorus 1]
Seasons change, surely it won't be the same
I'm hoping I won't stay the same
Reasons strange, why we all must play these games
[Verse 2]
I left it with you: a note that was discreet
I made sure I put it upon the cellar door
It's hanging, hoping, will you read it while I weep?
Last time, the last time, it flickers through me
So vivid, it rushes from my head down to my feet
We're laughing, joking, through a dance to my defeat
[Chorus 2]
Seasons change, it'll never be the same
I'm hoping I won't stay the same
Reasons strange, why we all must play these games[Chorus 2]
Seasons change, it'll never be the same
I'm hoping I won't stay the same
Reasons strange, why we all must play these games
[Outro]
Seasons change, it'll never be the same
I'm hoping I won't stay the same
