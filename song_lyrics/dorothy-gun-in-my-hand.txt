[Verse 1]
Why did love put a gun in my hand?
Why did love put a gun in my hand?
Why did love put a gun in my hand?
In my bed, in my head, in my hand
[Chorus]
Was it for redemption?
Was it for revenge?
Was it for the bottle?
Was it for the ledge?
Was it for the thrill of pushing my hope to the edge?
Why did love, why did love put a gun in my hand?
Why did love, why did love put a gun in my hand?
[Verse 2]
Why did love put a knife in my heart?
Why did love open up my scars?
Why did love put a knife in my heart?
In my bed, in my head, in my heart
[Chorus]
Was it for redemption?
Was it for revenge?
Was it for the bottle?
Was it for the ledge?
Was it for the thrill of pushing my hope to the edge?
Why did love, why did love put a gun in my hand?[Bridge]
Why did love, why did love
Why did love put a gun in my hand?
(Why did love, why did love, why did love)
Put a gun in my hand (why did love, why did love)
Why did love put a gun in my hand?
Whoa in my hand
[Chorus/Outro]
Ohh, was it for redemption?
Was it for revenge?
Was it for the bottle?
Was it for the ledge? (Who-oa)
Was it for the thrill of pushing my hope to the edge?
Why did love, why did love put a gun in my hand?
Ooh, in my hand
Why did love, why did love put a gun in my hand?
