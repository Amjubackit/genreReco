[Intro]
She's so persua—, oh
[Chorus]
She's so persuasive
That marijuana
She's so flirtatious
How does it feel to be you?
So persuasive
That marijuana
She's so flirtatious
How does it feel to be you? (Keep it goin')
[Verse 1]
Feel like the feelin' of a silk press
Feel like I feel like I got new breasts
Feel like I feel like I needed rest
Feel it's the season I should let go
And that's the reason I'ma buy more
Feel it's the season I should fly solo
I'm so sedated and she so persuasive
This isolation, so sweet you could taste it
Wake-bake in the mornin', moonlight, y'all be yawnin'
It's three in thе mornin' and I'm still performin'
[Chorus]
She's so persuasivе (So persua—)
That marijuana (Marijua—)
She's so flirtatious (So flirta—)
How does it feel to be you?
So persuasive (So persua—)
That marijuana (Marijua—)
She's so flirtatious (So flirta—)
How does it feel to be you? (Keep it goin')[Post-Chorus]
She's so per—
She's so per—
She's so per—
How does it feel to be you?
[Verse 2]
If it's weed, on sight, then it's all okay
Moods alright if we all gettin' paid
Socks on thigh and we all too high
To be not okay, to be not on key (How does it feel to be you?)
All night long, goin' all damn day
Ninety-nine hoes, bet all dem gays
Sun gon' shine and they all gon' grind
'Til they all get fine and they all get shaded
All of them persuaded you to be my baby
Weezy We "F" Baby and the F is for "faded"
Snortin' lines like eighties and we so flirtatious
And we so persuasive, face or flee
[Chorus]
She's so persuasive (So persua—)
That marijuana (Marijua—)
She's so flirtatious (So flirta—)
How does it feel to be you?
So persuasive (So persua—)
That marijuana (Marijua—)
She's so flirtatious (So flirta—)
How does it feel to be you? (Keep it goin')[Post-Chorus]
She's so per—, she's so per—, she's so per—
She's, she's so per—
How does it feel to be you?
[Bridge]
How does it feel to be that-that bitch?
How does it feel to be that-that bitch?
How does it feel to be that-that bitch?
How does it feel to let, let-let go?
How does it feel to let, let-let go?
How does it feel to let, let-let go?
She's a hard, she's a hardworker
[Chorus]
She's so persuasive (She's a hardworker)
That marijuana (She's a hardworker)
She's so flirtatious
How does it feel to be you?
So persuasive
That marijuana
She's so flirtatious
How does it feel to be you?
[Outro]
(How does it feel to be you?)
(How does it feel to be you?)
How does it feel to be you?
