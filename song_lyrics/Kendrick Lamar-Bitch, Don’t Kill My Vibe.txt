[Chorus 1: Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise, 
Kendrick Lamar
]
I am a sinner
Who's prob'ly gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me, Lord, forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
, 
I got
My drink, I got my music, I would share it, but today I'm yellin'
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe
[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
I can feel the changes, I can feel a new life, I always
Knew life can be dangerous
, 
I can say that I like a challenge
And you tell me it's painless, you don't know what pain is
How can I paint this picture when the color blind is hangin' witcha?
Fell on my face and awoke with a scar, another mistake livin' deep in my heart
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick
, 
I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every makin' of his?
 
Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge, even a small lighter can burn a bridge
[Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I can feel the changes, I can feel the new people round me
Just wanna be famous
, 
you can see that my city found me
Then put me on stages, to me, that's amazin'
To you, that's a quick check
, 
with all disrespect, let me say this
