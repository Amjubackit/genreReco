[Chorus: MIKNNA]
You know it's fade on sight
If you don’t come right
You know it's fade on sight
If you don't come right
Baby, come over, you should lay over
Girl, I want your love
You know I need it (Know I need it)
Baby, come over, you should lay over
Girl, I want your love
You know I need it (Know I need it)
[Verse 1: Kadhja Bonet]
Could it be
Nobody knows your baby
Not before, but now I want more
Yeah, I want you, baby
Could it feel the same though if I know a secret thing?
’Cause we can't take it back no more
Never the same, but we can go on
'Cause I just wanna be your baby
[Chorus: MIKNNA]
Baby, come over, you should lay over
Girl, I want your love
You know I need it (Know I need it)
Baby, come over, you should lay over
Girl, I want your love
You know I need it (Know I need it)
You know it's fade on sight
If you don't come right
Gonna catch this flight
It was love at first sight
