[Verse 1]
I miss you and I have to tell someone
It's nothing new, but I still can't handle it
[Pre-Chorus]
If this is love and I'm stood up
Then what's the point? I'm giving up
A clean break, a heartache
It's just another earthquake
[Chorus]
Well, you've caught me right on time
So for now let's enjoy the sunshine
Well, you've caught me right on time
So for now let's enjoy the sunshine
Yeah, let's get it, let's get it, alright
I see the one, I see the one I like, alright
Wеll, you've caught me right on time
So for now lеt's enjoy the sunshine
[Verse 2]
At the station, come down and you'll find me there
Yeah, I'll be waiting, I'm not going anywhere
[Pre-Chorus]
If this is love and I'm stood up
Then what's the point? I'm giving up
A train break, a heartache
It's just another earthquake
