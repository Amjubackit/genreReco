[Verse 1]
When I close my eyes
I can see a ghost from the past
And it cuts just like a knife
Hate to feel like this
But it happens all the time
Said you never understand me
Don't know who I am
Tell me I'm just like your father
I'm not the one who caved in
[Pre-Chorus]
You disappeared without a trace
You never bothered to explain
You just walked away
[Chorus]
All I wanted was an answer
All I needed was to know
Give me a reason
I need a reason
All those messages I left you
All those nights I spent alone
Give me a reason
'Cause all that I hear is
A dial tone
Dial tone
