[Verse 1]
Tragedies are common place
All kinds of diseases
People are slipping away
The economy's down
People can't get enough pay
As for me all I can say is
[Chorus]
Thank You Lord for all You've done for me
[Verse 2]
Folks without homes
Living out in the streets
And the drug habit some say
They just can't beat
Muggers and robbers
No place seems to be safe, Lord
But You've been my protection
Every step of the way, I wanna say
Thank You Lord for all You've done for me
[Bridge]
It could have been me
(Thank You)
Outdoors
(Thank You)
With no food
(Thank You)
And no clothes
(Thank You)
Or all alone
(Thank You)
Without a friend
(Thank You)
Or just another number
(Thank You)
With a tragic end
(Thank You, oh!)
But you didn't see fit
(Thank You)
To let none of these things be
(Thank You)
But, everyday by Your power
(Thank You)
You keep on keepin' me
(Thank You)
And I wanna say
