[Intro]
Pockets so fat, call me orbit
Norbit, I mean
Ain't gotta wait to make no moves 'cause I be loaded
[Chorus]
Ain't gotta wait to make no moves 'cause I be loaded
Why you out here drinkin' 40's, I just tote it
Still that same nigga in a foreign, but it's stolen
Ridin' sporty, actin' spoiled, I can't control it
I'm doing fraud, got that bag, yeah, I'm transportin'
I got that bag on me, nigga, like I'm Jansportin'
He dropped his mixtape, thought I woulda repost it
I ain't post his mixtape 'cause I don't fuck with shorty
[Verse 1]
I be booted to the morning, PM to the morning
My lil' woadie wanna bag him, he just want a Rollie
Hold up nigga, don't you owe me? Yeah you owe me, don't it?
Like I'm in Islands of Adventure how I stay rolling
Tryna diss me, I leave you six feet
She say she miss me, she wanna kiss me
Damn, Iâ€™m so crispy, xans got me dizzy
Try me I ain't shy, I keep that Glizzy
I was spendin' (Yeah, yeah), Frisbee
What the lick read? Baby, come and lick me
V12, how I'm ridin' in the 6 speed
I be ballin' on you niggas out of this league
