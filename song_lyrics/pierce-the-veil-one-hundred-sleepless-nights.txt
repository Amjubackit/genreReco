[Verse 1]
I can't wait to see your brilliant face
Light up the room around the pillowcase
She said, "Can you come over to my LA place
I got something to tell you and it just can't wait"
[Verse 2]
When I showed up, you held the door in tears
Sat on the couch under the chandeliers
You said you're having a baby and before I could cry
You're leaving me just when I thought you were mine
[Pre-Chorus]
But I don't see your face
Taken by the one-hearted race
Oh no, don't tell your other man
I got a hell of a plan
[Chorus]
Failing lights amass one hundred sleepless nights
And I might be holding on too tight
But there's a beast in my heart and he won't let you leave alive
[Verse 3]
Nightmares no longer wait for sleep
Crawl on the ground on both your hands and knees
Just like a lion and you're the queen of the pride
And we will feast together till the bones are gone
