[Intro: Yung Christ]
(You did good $lick)
(It's a Smash!)
Wetto, Wetto, Wetto
Wetto, Wetto, Wetto
Wet, wet, wet, wet, wet, wet, wet
[Verse 1: Yung Christ]
I got the Glock in my yoga pants
Fucking that bitch in a yoga stance
Swangin'
 that 
K'
 with an 
open stance
Loaded from smoking that opium
Stain a lil' boy in the clothes he's in
All of my walls, they closing in
51/50, they tryna come get me
Just minding my business and moseying
Matte black, smokin' packs
Panic attacks, back to back
Xanax on my lap, debatin'
Should I relapse?
But back to the hoe I was talkin' 'bout
I just wanna put it up in her mouth
Pimping up in my blood, what's up cuz?
Thuggin' that dirty South
Four letters, two numbers, bitch, Grey*59
Three fingers in the air, main bitch by my side
$licky pull up in a quartеr mill' and slaughter up your daughter
Yung Jesus with thеm Forgi wheels don't walk, he drive on water
Anytime, any place
Any hood, any state
Good 'til it fuckin' ain't
Woods to the fuckin' face
Ridin' with my baby sage
Lines on expensive plates
Tears on my diamond chains
Stoic, never looking phased
Poet when I'm spitting game (Game)
Show me how that pussy shaved (Shaved)
Dosage climbin' with my shame (Shame)
Mama crying for my pain (Pain)
Will they ever understand? (No)
Can I even help my dad? (No)
Money fuckin' up my fam'
Giving until there's nothing left
Pulling up in that latest (Damn!)
Choppa stay on me, don't need no hands
Prefer to be lonely, don't need no friends
Hoe we just fuckin', I don't date fans
I'm with my cousin and talkin' plans
Went to my hood and I copped some land
Blowing through my money like Democrats
Two-step on the IRS, fuck a tax
