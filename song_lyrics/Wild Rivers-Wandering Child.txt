I wish I met you further along
Gave you my older heart, still and strong
But I wouldn't have a fire like I do today
Oh, it burns for you babe
Oh, you got nothing on my tendency to be led astray
Oh, it took a blindside hit to show me the right of way
When your footsteps conquer the street
From your eyes to the soles of your feet
May my body and heart remain wild
For I'm a wandering child
I could keep an arms length
So I don't fall
I never learned to punch with my back against the wall
Oh no, I gotta let it go
And I got a feeling
Deep in my bones
I can't sit still when there's a space up in the road
There's a fire coming on you in your lane
And it burns for you, babe
Oh, you got nothing on my tendency to be led astray
Oh, it took a blindside hit to show me the right of way
