[Verse 1]
She was surrounded while she was alone
When did my house become less of a home?
She was so tired
But her eyes remained open
So much to say
But her words remained unspoken
Weep not for me
For my mind weren't holdin' no peace
Rita carried so much weight
Nobody knew 'til it was too late
[Chorus]
Rita is gone
She ain't comin' back in your lifetime
She's gone
She won't wait for you in your next life
Gone, gone, gone, she's gone
[Verse 2]
Said I'm loneliest when I'm with you
At my best when I'm alone
But I need someone here beside me, baby
Please don't stay gone too long
'Cause your love continues to hurt me, baby
This heart's been breakin' slowly
But this loneliness could kill me faster
Find it in yourself to stay
[Chorus]
Rita is gone
She ain't comin' back in your lifetime
She's gone
She won't wait for you in your next life
Lord, she's gone
She ain't comin' back in your lifetime
She's gone
She won't wait for you in your next life
Gone, gone, gone, she's gone
[Outro]
Rita is gone
Gone, gone, gone, she's gone
Rita is gone
Gone, gone, gone, she's gone
Rita is gone
Gone, gone, gone, she's gone
Rita is gone
Gone, gone, gone, she's gone
Rita is gone
Gone, gone, gone...
