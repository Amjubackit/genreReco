[Verse 1]
I'd give the world to her
As long as my heart's still beating
As long as she's next to me
As long as this love's still fleeting
[Chorus]
Because I like her
[Verse 2]
I'd kill in cold blood
I'd draw my own blood
Long as she's there beside me
Life could feel so good
[Chorus]
Because I like her
[Bridge]
Could it be make believe?
Am I just walking through a dream?
Haven't felt this way in
Such a long time, I do believe
[Outro]
That I like her
