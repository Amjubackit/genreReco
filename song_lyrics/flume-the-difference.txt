[Verse 1]
The difference in between
All the faces you read
When the grass ain't green
When you fix everything
[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know about you
But I got to get it out and I don't know how soon
But if we die
I want to bring the whole thing
[Chorus]
Ooooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
[Verse 2]
Who cares about a game
When it's all been replaced?
Each level feels the same
It really goes either way
[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know about you
But I got to get it out and I don't know how soon
But if we die
I want to bring the whole thing[Chorus]
Ooooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
[Outro]
Just another world that I gotta get a grip of and hold onto
Just another world that I gotta get a grip of and hold onto
(Ooooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh)
Just another world that I gotta get a grip of and hold onto
Just another world that I gotta get a grip of and hold onto
(Ooooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
