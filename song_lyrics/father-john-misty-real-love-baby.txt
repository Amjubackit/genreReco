[Verse]
Our hearts are free
So tell me what's wrong with the feeling
I'm a flower, you're the bee
It's much older than you and me
I'm in love, I'm alive
I belong to the stars and sky
Let's forget who we are for one night
We're not animals, baby
It's the people who lie (to themselves)
[Chorus]
I want real love, baby
Ooh, don't leave me waiting
I've got real love maybe
Wait until you taste me
I want real love, baby
There's a world inside me
Got the key, just use it
Just if for a minute (and gone)
[Verse Reprise]
Our hearts are free
So tell me what's wrong with the feeling
I'm a flower, you're the bee
It's much older than you and me
I'm in love, I'm alive
I belong to the stars and sky
Let's forget who we are for one night
We're not animals, baby
It's the people who lie (to themselves)
[Chorus]
I want real love, baby
Ooh, don't leave me waiting
I've got real love maybe
Wait until you taste me
I want real love, baby
There's a world inside me
Got the key, just use it
Just if for a minute (and gone)
I want real love, baby
Ooh, don't leave me waiting
I've got real love maybe
Wait until you taste me
I want real love, baby
There's a world inside me
Got the key, just use it
Just if for a minute (and gone)
