[Chorus]
Hey-o
Here comes the danger up in this club
When we get started man, we ain't gonna stop
We gonna turn it out 'til it gets too hot
Everybody sing, hey-o
Tell 'em turn it up 'til they can't no more
Let's get this thing shakin' like a disco ball
This is ya last warning, a courtesy call
Hey-o
Here comes the danger up in this club
When we get started man, we ain't gonna stop
We gonna turn it out 'til it gets too hot
Everybody sing, hey-o
Tell 'em turn it up 'til they can't no more
Let's get this thing shakin' like a disco ball
This is ya last warning, a courtesy call
[Verse 1]
I am not afraid of the storm that comes my way
When it hits, it shakes me to the core
And makes me stronger than before
It's not a question about trust
But will you stand with us?
Can you feel it?
Make it real and...
