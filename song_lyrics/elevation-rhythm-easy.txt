[Intro]
Hey
[Verse 1]
I don't have to sing it like an angel (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
I can come to You with confidence (Mm-mm-mm-mm)
It's easier than I've made it⁠
We don't have to act like perfect people (Oh, no)
To get an invitation to Your table
It's easier than we've made it⁠ (Ooh)
So much easier than we've made it⁠
[Chorus]
All that You want is my attention
God, if that is my cost, You can have my forever
I'll keep finding a billion ways to show You
A billion ways to show You
J-just how much I love You
[Post-Chorus]
Mm (Oh)
Yeah, yeah
[Verse 2]
I could turn my car into an altar⁠
Oh, we could turn this room into a church⁠
It's easier than we've madе it⁠ (Oh, oh)
And I won't save my worship for a Sunday⁠
'Cause life with You is morе than just a song⁠⁠ (Yeah)
It's easier than we've made it
So much easier than we've made it⁠ (Oh)
[Chorus]
All that You want is my attention
God, if that is my cost, You can have my forever
I'll keep finding a billion ways to show You
A billion ways to show You
J-just how much I love You
All that You want is my attention (Ooh)
God, if that is my cost (My cost), You can have my forever
I'll keep finding a billion ways to show You
A billion ways to show You
Just how much I love You (Ooh)
