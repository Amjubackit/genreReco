[Verse 1: May Angeles]
Jesus is in this room
Here right now, here right now
Making this place I stand
Holy ground, holy ground
Love You, Jesus
[Verse 2: Ryan Kennedy]
Your Spirit moves and breathes
All around, all around
All good and perfect things
Flowing down, flowing down
[Pre-Chorus: Ryan Kennedy & May Angeles]
If all of the heavens are singing along
With the saints and the elders in glorious song
And the praises they sing never seem to get old
Then I'll stay here forever singing
[Chorus: Ryan Kennedy & May Angeles]
Holy, holy, holy Lord
God Almighty, over all
’Cause You were, You are, and You'll be forever
The King, enthroned, in glorious splendor
Holy, holy Lord
You are holy, You are holy[Verse 3: Ryan Kennedy & May Angeles]
Gentle love calling me
Closer still, closer still
Jesus, You're guiding me
To Your will, to Your will
Come on
[Pre-Chorus: Ryan Kennedy & May Angeles]
If all of the heavens are singing along
With the saints and the elders in glorious song
And the praises they sing never seem to get old
Then I’ll stay here forever singing
[Chorus: Ryan Kennedy & May Angeles]
Holy, holy, holy Lord
God Almighty, over all
'Cause You were, You are, and You'll be forever
The King, enthroned, in glorious splendor
Holy, holy Lord
[Bridge: Ryan Kennedy & May Angeles]
The veil is torn and the doors fling wide
I see glory as I run inside
The throne room, before You, I bow, I bow
The veil is torn and the doors fling wide
I see glory as I run inside
The throne room, before You, I bow
The veil is torn and the doors fling wide
I see glory as I run inside
The throne room, before You, I bow[Chorus: Ryan Kennedy & May Angeles]
Holy, holy, holy Lord
God Almighty, over all
'Cause You were, You are, and You'll be forever
The King, enthroned, in glorious splendor
Holy, holy Lord
Holy, holy, holy Lord
God Almighty, hey, over all
'Cause You were, You are, and You'll be forever
The King, enthroned, in glorious splendor
You were
You were, You are, and You'll be forever
The King, enthroned, in glorious splendor
You were
You were, You are, and You’ll be forever
The King, enthroned, in glorious splendor
Holy, holy Lord
[Post-Chorus: Ryan Kennedy & 
May Angeles
]
Holy, holy are You
You are so holy, oh, You are so holy
Holy, holy, holy
You are so holy
[Verse 1: Ryan Kennedy & May Angeles]
Jesus is in this room
Making this place I stand
Holy ground, holy ground[Interlude: May Angeles]
This holy ground
This is holy ground
We are standing on holy ground
[Outro: Ryan Kennedy & 
May Angeles
]
And oh Lord, You’re beautiful
Your face is all I see
[7:31?], You're so beautiful
[For Your eyes are on this child?]
[Your grace abounds to me?]
We feel the weight of Your glory
We feel the weight of Your glory in this place, Lord
Oh how beautiful You are, Jesus
