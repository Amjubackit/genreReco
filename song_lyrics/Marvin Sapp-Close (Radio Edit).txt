[Chorus 1]
I must be close to my destiny
Extremely close to my victory
'Cause here comes
Trials and troubles, jealousy and envy
I must be close to what You have for me
I must be close to my overflow
Extremely close to my miracle
Because here comes
Confusion, problems and enemies
I just believe
That I must be close to what You have for me
[Verse 1]
To whom much is given, so much is required
Be qualified, must go through the fire
But I won't smell like smoke
I'll be better than before
His guidance is in my life
Just to let me know
[Chorus 2]
I must be close... (to my destiny)
(Extremely close...) I'm extremely close
(To my victory...) Yes I am
('Cause here comes)
(Trials) and (troubles) and (jealousy and envy)
(I must be close...) I must be close
(To what You have for me)
(Must be close to my overflow)
(Extremely close...) Extremely close
(To my miracle)
Because here comes
(Confusion) and (problems) and (and enemies)
(I just believe) I just believe
(That I am close to what You have for me)
