[Chorus]
Have I told you lately that I love you?
Have I told you there's no one above you?
You fill my heart with gladness
And you take away my sadness
You ease my troubles, that's what you do
[Verse 1]
Oh, the morning sun in all its glory
It greets the day with hope and comfort too
And you fill my life with laughter
And you can make it better
You ease my troubles, that's what you do
[Bridge]
There's a love that's divine
And it's yours and it's mine, like the sun
So at the end of the day
We should give thanks and pray to the One
[Chorus]
And say, have I told you lately that I love you?
And have I told you there's no one above you?
You fill my heart with gladness
You take away my sadness
You ease my troubles, that's what you do[Piano Solo]
[Bridge]
There's a love that's divine
And it's yours and it's mine
And it's just like the sun
At the end of the day
We will give thanks and pray to the One
[Chorus]
Have I told you lately that I love you?
And have I told you there's no one above you?
Fill my heart with gladness
Take away my sadness
Ease my troubles, that's what you do
[Outro]
Take away my sadness
Fill my life with gladness, yeah
Ease my troubles, that's what you do
Fill my life with gladness
Take away my sadness
Ease my troubles, that's what you do
