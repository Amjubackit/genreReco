[Verse 1]
Yeah, I bet that shotgun headrest still smells like my shampoo
That messed up tape deck's still stuck playin' that mix I made for you
Yeah, that's my strawberry wine stain
My nail polish on the tailgate
So much of me left, I bet, you must get d√©ja vu
[Chorus]
When you're runnin' around in that stick shift Chevy, I bet it drives you crazy
Thinkin' about us on every other back road, baby
You got someone new on your bench seat, tryin' to forget me lately
But my memory's stuck, so good luck
Tryna get me out of that truck
[Verse 2]
So go on, touch that paint up where I scratched the driver's side
That won't take back all our weekend for no reason rides
Yeah, I bet the left side of the flatbed
Will always be mine in your head
Even though it's not me counting stars with you tonight
[Chorus]
When you're runnin' around in that stick shift Chevy, I bet it drives you crazy
Thinkin' about us on every other back road, baby
You got someone new on your bench seat, tryin' to forget me lately
But my memory's stuck, so good luck
Tryna get me out of that truck, yeah
[Bridge]
Ooh, you can shine it up, you can clean it out
Spin those tires all over town
When the music's up and the window's down
I'm the one you're thinking 'bout
My Silverado silhouette
Still shotgun riding in your head
[Chorus]
So when you're runnin' around in that stick shift Chevy, I bet it drives you crazy
Thinkin' about us on every other back road, baby
You got someone new on your bench seat, trying to forget me lately
But my memory's stuck, so good luck
Tryna get me out of that truck
Mm-hmm
[Outro]
My Silverado silhouette
Still shotgun riding in your head
