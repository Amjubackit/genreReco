[Verse 1]
Remy was a pit mix, she was just skin and bones
Daddy found in a deep ditch on his way home
He said, "She hopped right up" when he opened his door
When you feel that kinda feeling, son, you found yours
[Verse 2]
Age of seventeen you worked all summer long
Washing cars and pulling weeds from your neighbor's lawn
Well, it wasn't no King Ranch but she was paid for
When you find that kinda freedom, buddy, you found yours
[Chorus]
Woah-ooh-woah, you found yours
That living, breathing reason you've been looking for
Woah-ooh-woah, don't need nothing more
When you feel that kinda feeling, yeah, you found yours
[Verse 3]
She was an answer to an ol' boy's prayer
Way out of your league but you didn't care
When you stole that kiss on her daddy's front porch
That feeling that you're feeling, buddy, you found yours
[Chorus]
Woah-ooh-woah, you found yours
That living, breathing reason you've been looking for
Woah-ooh-woah, don't need nothing more
When you feel that kinda feeling, yeah, you found yours
Come on[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 4]
A fresh coat of blue paint on a bedroom wall
Turns to two little feet running up and down the hall
And now it's plain as day what you're down here for
If you were looking for a reason, buddy, you found yours
[Chorus]
Woah-ooh-woah, you found yours
That living, breathing reason you've been looking for
Woah-ooh-woah, don't need nothing more
When you feel that kinda feeling, yeah, you found yours
