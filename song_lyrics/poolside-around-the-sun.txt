[Chorus]
Another year around the sun
Guess I've just been havin' fun
Just another year around the sun
Making it through
[Verse 1]
Lay in bed at the end of the day
Got nobody to tell I'm okay
Forget the rules of the games we play
But that's fine, mm
People say that I've lost my mind
I've got nothin' to lose and nothin' to find
They might say that I'm the losin' kind, but that's fine, ooh
[Chorus]
Another year around the sun
Guess I've just been havin' fun
Just another year around the sun
Making it through
Another year around the sun
Guess I've just been havin' fun
Just another year around the sun
Making it through
[Bridge]
Make it, make it, make it through
Make it, make it, make it through
Make it, make it, make it through
[Chorus]
Another year around the sun
Guess I've just been havin' fun
Just another year around the sun
Making it through
Another year around the sun
Guess I've just been havin' fun
Just another year around the sun
Making it through
[Outro]
Oh yeah, making it through
Oh yeah, making it through
Making it through
