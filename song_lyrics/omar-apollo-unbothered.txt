[Hook]
I don't need what you need
I'm so unbothered by you
I used to think you're the only thing bright like the moon
[Indistinguishable singing]
[Bridge]
I feel (oh)
I feel (oh)
I feel (oh)
I feel (oh)
I've been avoiding you, sorry if you feel alone
I'm doing fine
[Ending]
I don't need what you need
I'm so unbothered by you
