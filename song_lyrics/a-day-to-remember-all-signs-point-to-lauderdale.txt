[Chorus]
I hate this town, it's so washed up
And all my friends don't give a fuck
Don't tell me that it's just bad luck
When will I find where I fit in? 
Two! Three! Four!
[Verse 1]
Remember when I tried
I never strayed too far from you
Forever by your side
No matter what I was going through
[Pre-Chorus]
But now, I never know the things to say to you
That help me prove that I'm still on your side
I never show just what you do to me
Guess I was always wrong
[Chorus]
I hate this town, it's so washed up
And all my friends don't give a fuck
Don't tell me that it's just bad luck
When will I find where I fit in?
[Verse 2]
I hate this town
'Cause no one can understand
I just can't be tied down
Nothing comes between me and my plans
