[Verse 1]
When a man must walk the devil's road
Churning up the Earth below
He is bound to brothers built by nations
With no pride to call his own
[Chorus]
Woah, the trouble gets so loud
When all of hell tries to drag you down
Woah, the wounded warrior
On this battleground
[Verse 2]
Who is he to think of his survival
When a man must kill his home?
Standing naked in the breast of canyons
Where companions are alone
Oh, oh, oh, oh oh oh
[Chorus]
Woah, the trouble gets so loud
When all of hell tries to drag you down
Woah, the wounded warrior
On this battleground
