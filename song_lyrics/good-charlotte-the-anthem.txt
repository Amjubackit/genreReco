[Intro]
Yeah...
Here we go...
[Verse 1]
It's a new day, but it all feels old
"It's a good life!" That's what I'm told
But everything, it all just feels the same
At my high school, it felt more to me
Like a jail cell, a penitentiary
My time spent there, it only made me see
[Pre-Chorus]
That I don't ever wanna be like you
I don't wanna do the things you do
I'm never gonna hear the words you say
And I don't ever wanna
[Chorus]
I don't ever wanna be you
Don't wanna be just like you
Uh, what I'm sayin' is
This is the anthem, throw all your hands up
You, don't wanna be you
[Verse 2]
"Go to college or university
Get a real job!" That's what they said to me
But I could never live the way they want
I'm gonna get by and just do my time
Out of step while they all get in line
I'm just a minor threat, so pay no mind
