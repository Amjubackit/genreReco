[Intro]
Morning dew
Vaporised
Rays of sun
Blinding my eyes
'Cause I feel alive
[Refrain]
Good times (Don't you leave me now)
You'll find (Ooh)
Good times (Got me crying out)
Down in the street
[Verse]
Lights out
Super power (Super power)
You can't hide
From what you gotta do
Light up
The Eiffel Tower
It feels like there ain't nothing to lose
[Refrain]
Good times (Don't you leave me now)
You'll find (Ooh)
Good times (Got me crying out)
Down in the street
