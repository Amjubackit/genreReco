[Intro: Post Malone]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah (
Hey
)
[Chorus: Post Malone]
My mama called, seen you on TV, son
Said shit done changed ever since we was on
I dreamed it all ever since I was young
They said I wouldn't be nothing
Now they always say, "Congratulations" (Uh, uh, uh)
Worked so hard, forgot how to vacation (Uh-huh)
They ain't never had the dedication (Uh, uh)
People hatin', say we changed and look, we made it (Uh, uh)
Yeah, we made it (Uh, uh, uh)
[Verse 1: Post Malone]
They was never friendly, yeah
Now I'm jumping out the Bentley, yeah
And I know I sound dramatic, yeah
But I know I had to have it, yeah
For the money, I'm a savage, yeah
I be itching like an addict, yeah
I'm surround by twenty bad bitch, yeah
But they didn't know me last year, yeah
Everyone wanna act like they important (Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah)
But all that mean nothing when I saw my dough, yeah (Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah)
Everyone countin' on me drop the ball, yeah (Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah)
Everything custom like I'm at the border, yeah, yeah
If you fuck with winning, put your lighters to the sky
How could I make cents when I got millions on my mind?
Coming with that bullshit, I just put it to the side
Balling since a baby, they could see it in my eyes
