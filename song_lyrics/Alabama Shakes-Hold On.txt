[Verse 1]
Bless my heart, bless my soul
Didn't think I'd make it to twenty-two years old
There must be someone up above
Sayin', "Come on, Brittany, you got to come on up
[Chorus]
You got to hold on
Hey, you got to hold on"
[Verse 2]
So, bless my heart and bless yours, too
I don't know where I'm gonna go
Don't know what I'm gonna do
There must be somebody up above
Sayin', "Come on, Brittany, you got to come on up
[Chorus]
You got to hold on
Hey, you got to hold on"
[Bridge]
"Yeah, you gotta wait
Yeah, you gotta wait"
But I don't wanna wait
No, I don't wanna wait
