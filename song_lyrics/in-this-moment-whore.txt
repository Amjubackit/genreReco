[Verse 1]
I’m the girl you’re thinking about
The one thing you can’t live without
Yeah, I’m the girl you've been waiting for
I’ll have you down on your knees, I’ll have you begging for more
You probably thought I wouldn't get this far
You thought I’d end up in the back of a car
You probably thought that I’d never escape
I’d be a rat in a cage I'd be a slave to this place
You don’t know how hard I fought to survive, waking up alone when I was left to die
And you don’t know about this life I've lived, all these roads I've walked, all these tears I've bled
[Pre-Chorus]
So how can this be, you’re praying to me
There’s a look in your eyes, I know just what that means
I can be, I can be your everything
[Chorus]
I can be your whore!
I am the dirt you created
I am your sinner, I am your whore
But let me tell you something baby
You love me for everything you hate me for
[Verse 2]
I’m the one that you need and fear
Now that you’re hooked, it’s all becoming clear
That all your judgments that you placed on me was a reflection of discovery
So maybe next time when you cast your stones
From the shadows of the dark unknown
You will crawl up from your hiding place
And take a look in the mirror, see the truth in your face[Pre-Chorus]
So how can this be, you’re praying to me
There’s a look in your eyes, I know just what that means
I can be, I can be your everything
[Chorus]
I can be your whore!
I am the dirt you created
I am your sinner, I am your whore
But let me tell you something baby
You love me for everything you hate me for
[Bridge]
I am the dirt you created
I am your sinner, I am your whore
But let me tell you something baby
You love me, you want me, you need me
[Chorus]
I can be your whore!
I am the dirt you created
I am your sinner, I am your whore
But let me tell you something baby
You love me for everything you hate me for
[Outro]
I can be your whore
I can be your whore
I can be your whore
But let me tell you something baby
You love me for everything you hate me for
You love me for everything…you hate me for
