[Intro]
So long, you did me wrong
So long, you did me wrong
[Verse 1]
Baby, what you doin' now?
You're pissin' me off
But your hair is so luxurious
And your lips are so soft
Any way you slice it
You're doing me wrong
But I love the way you walk now
And your legs are so long
[Pre-Chorus]
Well, your looks had me putty in your hand now
But I took just as much as I can stand now
[Chorus]
And you can walk your long legs, baby, right out of my life
So long, you did me wrong
Yeah, you can walk your long legs, baby, right out of my life
So long, you did me wrong
[Verse 2]
From the moment that I met you
I thought you were fine, so fine
But your shitty fuckin' attitude
Has got me changing my mind, yeah
Everybody tells me
I need to let go, I know
But your cocoa butter skin now
Has got me beggin' for more, well[Pre-Chorus]
Well, your heels keep on running through my head now
I tried to deal, but I'm coming to the edge now
[Chorus]
And you can walk those high heels, baby, right out of my life
So long, you did me wrong, yeah
Yeah, you can walk those high heels, baby, right out of my life
So long, you did me wrong
[Bridge]
Tell me why
Why'd you turn the blues skies cloudy grey?
You know I
I can't let you keep treating me this way, oh
[Verse 3]
You've been jerking me around, but
I kept my eyes shut, yeah
'Cause you're shaped like an hourglass
But I think your time's up
[Pre-Chorus]
Well, your heart's like a blackened piece of coal now
And I doubt that you ever had a soul now[Chorus]
And you can walk your cold heart, baby, right out of my life
So long, you did me wrong
Yeah, you can walk your cold heart, baby, right out of my life
So long, you did me wrong
[Outro]
Just a-walk it out (So long you did me wrong), yeah
Keep on walkin' now (So long you did me wrong)
Leave me alone (So long you did me wrong)
Ooh, I'm better off on my own (So long you did me wrong)
