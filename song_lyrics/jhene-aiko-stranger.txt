[Verse 1]
Yeah, yeah, ah
Similar ways, similar game
Starting to feel the similar pain
Are you sure we haven't met before?
I know ya face, I know ya name
But I don't know you?
Isn't that crazy? Isn't that crazy?
[Chorus]
I think we may be
In a different book, on a different page
You said you are different but you're the same
Stranger, I can not tell you
How many there have been
That were just like you
I do not need you
'Cause you're just like them
I meet 'em everyday
They all seem to be the same
Lame, okay?
I meet em' everyday
They all seem to be the same
It's strange, ah
[Verse 2]
Familiar time, familiar place
Starting to feel the familiar shame
'Cause I know what you have come here for
You know my name, you know my face
But you don't know me
You must be crazy
Or I must be crazy, or is it maybe
I've been here times before and
I've said "yes", meaning "no" but, oh
A lot of shit has changed
Lot of shit has changed
Lot-lot of shit has changed[Chorus]
Didn't I tell you what all the rest have done?
They were just like you, they have all tried to
You're not the only one
I meet em' everyday
They all seem to be the same
Lame, okay?
I meet 'em everyday
They all seem to be the same
It's strange, ah
I think we may be
In a different book, on a different page
You said you are different
But you're the same
Stranger
