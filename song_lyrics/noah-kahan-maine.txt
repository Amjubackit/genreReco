[Verse 1]
Tell me, lover
Now that you made your change
Was your soul rediscovered?
Was your heart rearranged?
Are you still taking pills in the morning?
And did you lose that longing now?
For a walk through an ocean town
'Cause this town's just an ocean now
[Verse 2]
You don't hate the summers
You're just afraid of the space
Asking strangers for answers
To forget what they say
A boat beside a dock in the sunlight
Nothing but the water and the sunrise now
Just the lack of an open mouth
'Cause this town's just an ocean now
[Chorus]
Bad
I'll miss this place, your head and your heart
And my dad still tells me when they're playing your songs
Laughing at the way that you would say
"If only, baby, there were cameras in the traffic lights
They'd make me a star
They'd make me a star"
[Post-Chorus]
I wanna go to Maine, mmm
I wanna go to Maine, oh
[Chorus]
Bad
I'll miss this place, your head and your heart
And my dad still tells me when they're playing your songs
Laughing at the way
That you would say
"If only, baby, there were cameras in the traffic lights
They'd make me a star
They'd make me a star"
[Post-Chorus]
I wanna go to Maine
I wanna go to Maine, God
[Outro]
Tell me, lover
Once you've had your change of heart
'Cause we're no more than the fossils
On Crescent Beach State Park
And we used to sing along to church bells on Sundays
And can you even hear em from the subway now?
And I hope that we make you proud
'Cause this town's just an ocean now
