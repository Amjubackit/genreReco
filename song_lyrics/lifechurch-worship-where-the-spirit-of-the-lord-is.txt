[Verse 1]
Do what only You can do
With one word the mountains move
When You breathe, the dead arise
And the bones come back to life
There is power in this room
[Chorus]
Where the spirit of the Lord is, there is life
Where the spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom
Like a river running wild
Like a never-ending fight
Where the spirit of the Lord is
[Verse 2]
It's Your name that tears down walls
And every enemy will fall
So we will stand and we will fight
Every wrong will be made right
There is power in this room
Oh, I believe
[Chorus]
Where the spirit of the Lord is, there is life
Where the spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom
Like a river running wild
Like a never-ending fight
Where the spirit of the Lord is, there is life
Where the spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom
Like a river running wild
Like a never-ending fight
Where the spirit of the Lord is
Ohhh
[Bridge]
You are moving through our cities
Your Spirit fills our streets
We’re shouting to the nations
Your love has set us free
You're moving through our cities
Your Spirit fills our streets
We're shouting to the nations
Your love has set us free, oh
You’re moving through our cities
Your Spirit fills our streets
We're shouting to the nations
Your love has set us free
[Chorus]
Where the spirit of the Lord is, there is life
Where the spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom
Like a river running wild
Like a never-ending fight
Where the spirit of the Lord is, there is life
Where the spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom
Like a river running wild
Like a never-ending fight
Where the spirit of the Lord is, oh
Where the spirit of the Lord is
