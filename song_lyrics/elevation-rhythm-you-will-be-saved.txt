[Verse 1]
Come as you are
Just as you are, it's time to come home
Out of the dark
There's no need to hide, He already sees you
Don't be afraid
To show Him your face
He won't turn you away
He'll never turn you away
[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody needs, everybody needs
Everybody needs saving
Everybody breaks, everybody bleeds
You don't have to be ashamed
[Chorus]
Call on Jesus, say His name
Just receive Him in your heart and you will be saved
And God has raised Him from the grave
Just believe it in your heart and you will be saved
[Verse 2]
As simple as that
Don't overthink, don't complicate it
No strings attached
He loves you, He loves you, oh-oh
[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody needs, everybody needs
Everybody needs saving
Everybody breaks, everybody bleeds
But you don't have to be ashamed
The Savior is a breath away, oh
[Chorus]
Call on Jesus, say His name
Just receive Him in your heart and you will be saved, oh
And God has raised Him from the grave, oh
Just believe it in your heart and you will be saved
[Post-Chorus]
You will be saved (You will be saved)
You will be saved (You will be saved)
You will be saved
So just believe it in your heart and you will be saved
[Interlude]
Ooh-ooh, oh-oh
Precious blood of Jesus, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
[Bridge]
What You did on the cross still saves us
Saves us, saves us
There is power in the name of Jesus
Jesus, Jesus
What You did on the cross still saves us
Saves us, saves us
There is power in the name of Jesus
Jesus, Jesus
What You did on the cross still saves us
Saves us, saves us
There is power in the name of Jesus
Jesus, Jesus
What You did on the cross still saves us
(We thank You, Jesus)
Saves us, saves us
There is power in the name of Jesus
Jesus, Jesus
Oh-oh-oh-oh
[Chorus]
Call on Jesus, say His name
Just receive Him in your heart and you will be saved, oh
And God has raised Him from the grave, oh
Just believe it in your heart and you will be saved
[Bridge]
What You did on the cross still saves us
Saves us, saves us
There is power in the name of Jesus
Jesus, Jesus
What You did on the cross still saves us
Saves us, saves us
Oh, there is power in the name of Jesus
Jesus, Jesus
[Instrumental Break]
[Outro]
As simple as that
Don't overthink, don't complicate it
No strings attached
He loves you, He loves you
Everybody needs, everybody needs
Everybody needs saving
Everybody breaks, everybody bleeds
The Savior is a breath away
