[Verse 1]
Make way for the rising tide
There's nothing left on the other side
Too late to apologize
No chance you can make this right
[Chorus]
I know you wanna keep me buried
I've been waking over every word you said
What will you do when your world stops turning?
Do you really wanna wake the dead?
[Verse 2]
If they try to divide us with silence
Cut the deadweight, bring the violence
Bring the violence
Don't say it's not enough, it's not enough
[Chorus]
I know you wanna keep me buried
I've been waking over every word you said
What will you do when your world stops turning?
Do you really wanna wake the dead?
So drag me through the flames (The flames)
And drown me in your waves (And I'll rise)
What will you do when your world stops turning?
Do you really wanna wake the dead?[Bridge]
Or we rise
We rise (Rise)
'Cause iron sharpens iron
And we were made in the fire
We rise (Rise)
We know your time is coming
And you were born to expire
[Chorus]
I know you wanna keep me buried
I've been waking over every word you said
What will you do when your world stops turning?
(Do you really wanna wake the dead?)
So drag me through the flames (The flames)
Drown me in your waves (And I'll rise)
What will you do when your world stops turning?
Do you really wanna wake the dead?
Do you really wanna wake the dead?
