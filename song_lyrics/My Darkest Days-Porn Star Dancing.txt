[Intro: Ludacris]
P-p-porn star dancing
[Verse 1: Matt Walst]
Kelly won't kiss my friend Cassandra
Jessica won't play ball
Mandy won't share her friend Miranda
Doesn't anybody live at all?
Amanda won't leave me empty-handed
Got her number from a bathroom stall
Brandy just got way too much baggage
And that shit just gets old (Hey)
[Pre-Chorus: Matt Walst]
But I got a girl who can put on a show
The dollar decides how far you can go
[Chorus: Matt Walst]
She wraps those hands around that pole
And she licks those lips and off we go
And she takes it off nice and slow
'Cause that's porn star dancin'
She don't play nice, she makes me beg
And she drops that dress around her legs
And I'm sittin' right by the stage
For this porn star dancin' (Hey)
