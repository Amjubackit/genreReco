Oh, I never see you anymore babe
Oh, I never see you anymore babe
Oh, you're gonna see me come the morning
Oh, that preacher preaching on the radio
Oh, that preacher preaching on the radio
Oh, he's shouting hellfire and brimstone
Oh, late at night, that's when you might find
Broke glass from a car crash
And it's shining like a pile of diamonds
Engine oil, anti-freeze, transmission fluid mix
And spreads across the puddle throwing colors in its slick
You seem to see forever, that's where you wanna go
Miles and miles of nothing down that Oklahoma road
Oh, it's always hurry up and wait, son
Oh, it's always hurry up and wait, son
Oh, you gotta wait until your time comes
