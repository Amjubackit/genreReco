[Verse 1]
I'm standing here on the ground
The sky above won't fall down
See no evil in all directions
Resolution of happiness
Things have been dark for too long
[Chorus]
Don't change for you
Don't change a thing for me
Don't change for you
Don't change a thing for me
[Verse 2]
I found a love I had lost
It was gone for too long
Hear no evil in all directions (directions)
Execution of bitterness
Message received loud and clear
[Chorus]
Don't change for you
Don't change a thing for me
Don't change for you
Don't change a thing for me[Verse 3]
I'm standing here on the ground
The sky above won't fall down
See no evil in all directions
Resolution of happiness
Things have been dark for too long
[Chorus]
Don't change for you
Don't change a thing for me
Don't change for you
Don't change a thing for me
Don't change for you
Don't change a thing for me
[Outro]
Don't change
Don't change
