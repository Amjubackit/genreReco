[Intro: Polly Misch]
"My cheek brushes against his
Smooth on stubble for a moment
And then it's gone
He walks along the platform as if in a dream
Every fiber in me wants to shout and scream
'Stop!'
To 
run
 across to him, to take him in my arms
To tell him, 'I love you! You silly, silly man, I love you!'
But instead I stand still
Heart cracking
Those little curls on the back of his head bouncing
As he steps out of my life, forever."
[Verse 1]
I hope that the fire we both made
Still burns a little in you
I wrote to you everyday
Did my letters find their way?
Our memories on my screen
Two lovers in this mystic dream
Baby, come back to me, come back to me
Too much time on my phone
Baby, do you still sleep alone?
Come back to me, come back to me
