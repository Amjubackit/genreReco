[Verse 1]
From the day you arrived
I've remained by your side
In chains, entombed
[Chorus]
Placed inside, safe and sound
Shapes and colors are all I see
[Verse 2]
On the day you arrived
I became your device
To name and soothe
[Chorus]
Placed inside, safe and sound
Shapes and colors are all I see
Shades of colors are all I feel
[Bridge]
From the day you arrived
I have stayed by your side
[Chorus]
Placed inside, safe and sound
Shades of colors are all I see
Shapes of colors are all I feel
Placed inside, safe and sound
Shades of colors are all I see
Safe inside
