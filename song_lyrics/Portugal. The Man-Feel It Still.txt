[Verse 1]
Can't keep my hands to myself
Think I'll dust 'em off, put 'em back up on the shelf
In case my little baby girl is in need
Am I coming out of left field?
[Chorus]
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks now
I been feeling it since 1966 now
Might be over now, but I feel it still
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks now
Let me kick it like it's 1986 now
Might be over now, but I feel it still
[Verse 2]
Got another mouth to feed
Leave it with a babysitter, mama, call the gravedigger
Gone with the fallen leaves
Am I coming out of left field?
[Chorus]
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks now
I been feeling it since 1966 now
Might've had your fill, but you feel it still
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks now
Let me kick it like it's 1986 now
Might be over now, but I feel it still
