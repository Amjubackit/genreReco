[Verse 1]
There's a star in the east
Over pyramids at Giza
Where there once lived a girl
She ruled the world
Then, down the Nile
He came with a smile
He was the king
She was the queen
Under the moonlight
[Pre-Chorus]
Your eyes won't believe
What your mind can't conceive
Ooh, ooh
[Chorus]
Nights over Egypt
Nights over Egypt
Nights over Egypt
[Post-Chorus]
Incense and myrrh
Girls that swirl
To the music
Nights over Egypt
[Verse 2]
Women Fellahin
Wear veils to been seen
By no one
Take a caravan
Across the Sudan
Saharan facade
Is just a mirage
Oasis in the sand
Where life once began
Under the moonlight
[Pre-Chorus]
Your eyes won't believe
What your mind can't conceive
[Chorus]
Nights over Egypt
Nights over Egypt
Nights over Egypt
Nights over Egypt
Nights over Egypt
Nights over Egypt
Nights over Egypt
Nights over Egypt
