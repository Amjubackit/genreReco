Stand face to face with the younger me
All of the mistakes
All of the heartbreak
Here's what I'd do differently
[Chorus: Joel]
I'd love like I'm not scared
Give when it's not fair
Live life for another
Take time for a brother
Fight for the weak ones
Speak out for freedom
Find faith in the battle
Stand tall but above it all
Fix my eyes on you
[Verse 2: Luke]
I learned the lines and talked the talk (everybody knows it, everybody knows it)
But the road less traveled is hard to walk
 
(everybody knows it, everybody knows)
It takes a soldier
Who knows his orders
To walk the walk I'm supposed to walk[Chorus: Joel]
And love like I'm not scared
Give when it's not fair
Live life for another
Take time for a brother
Fight for the weak ones
Speak out for freedom
Find faith in the battle
Stand tall but above it all
Fix my eyes on you
[Bridge]
The things of Earth are dimming
In the light of Your glory and grace
I'll set my sights upon Heaven
I'm fixing my eyes on you
I'm fixing my eyes on you
I'm fixing my eyes
[Chorus: Joel]
Love like I'm not scared
Give when it's not fair
Live life for another
Take time for a brother
Fight for the weak ones
Speak out for freedom
Find faith in the battle
Stand tall but above it all
Fix my eyes on you
I fix my eyes on you
I fix my eyes on you
