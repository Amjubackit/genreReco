Mom said, "Wait for the moment!"
Gone home, went to bed
While the other kids, they're still outside
I don't feel time when I sleep
So I snuggle up with my sheet
And wait, for a brighter day
I'll play football tomorrow
With only my best friends
People I like, but I don't love, are not allowed
I wonder if Sharon will see me
But I'll play cool
'Cause cool is what you have to do
It's hard to make a point
When you're living so loud
Turn it down
Trying to get my friend excited
About not being invited
I say: "That's an opportunity!"
Butt dialed I smile
Listen dialed I smile
It was so nice to get a call
