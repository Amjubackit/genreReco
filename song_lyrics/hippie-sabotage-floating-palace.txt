[Pre-Hook]
These monsters all around me
Learned to tune them out
I'm floating, finding balance
High up in the clouds
The ability won't probably ever be around
I'm in my floating palace
Drowning out the sounds
[Hook]
Drowning out the sounds
Drowning out the sounds
The ability won't probably ever be around
I'm in my floating palace
Drowning out the sounds
[Verse 1]
I'm on the devil's greyhound, hey
Headed to heaven's playground, hey
All life I've been space bound, hey
Keeping my head above ground, hey
I want to move, but time's running slow
Got on my knees to this city of ghosts
Likе as above, as so below
See peoplе may change but history don't
People may change but history don't
People maintain when they can't cope
People want fame when they need hope, yeah
People want fame when they need hope
We can't get bailed all we do is smoke
We need the release, I feel like I choke, yeah
Life can be brutal it does what it wants
It fills you with happiness, embedding us
It's taking a minute I'm still in the mud
Escaping the bullshit I still hear the buzz
I'm using the pain as a trip off the block
I'm fanning the flames, it will run out of stock
See people scream changes, sit back and watch
They want to go run but don't know how to walk[Pre-Hook]

[Verse 2]
I knew what I wanted out of life
I didn't know what was coming, aye
I knew I'd always find that space to thrive
I didn't know it would crush me, aye
Bag that empty feeling inside
Tryna relive everything I lost
I need to let go of all my pride
I stopped thinking about everything I caused (Ey)
Put one foot in front the other
Take this time to go discover
How to put my faith in others, yeah yeah
No reason to go suffer
But when times are getting tougher
Where do I go look for cover, yeah yeah
Truth can be brutal it does what it wants
It fills you with rage if you don't confornt
The demons inside that you should expunge
That might take a minute let go of that grudge
And what are you doing, you're stuck in a rut
You're giving the hate, ain't giving the love
You have people around, to help you back up
It's not how you fall, it's how you get up[Pre-Hook]
