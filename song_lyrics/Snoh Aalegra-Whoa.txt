[Verse 1]
I'ma tell you this one time
Boy, I want you to be mine
Can I come and see you now?
Can I lay with you outside?
Can I touch your lips with mine?
'Cause I need you now
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't wanna leave, I just wanna be here by your side
You make me feel and believe that we in paradise
'Cause I don't feel the ground
No, I don't feel the ground
But I'm feelin' right, I'll tell you what it's all about
'Cause you're makin' me feel this way
[Chorus]
And it's kinda like whoa
Da (Whoa, feel like)
Da (Whoa, feel like)
Da (Whoa, feel like)
Oh, you make me feel and believe, baby
Da (Whoa, feel like)
Da, da-da-da-da-da-da-da (Whoa, feel like)
('Cause you make me feel like whoa)
Oh no
