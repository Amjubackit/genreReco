Babe I know it swirls around me
Like the sun shines on the coast
Like a weathered, torn, once sturdy barn
I used to give you shelter and warmth
It's clear, I can see
The dry grass at my feet
As we wait to go, if you don't come home I'll just say
"Baby I know"
Babe I know
Baby I know
The course has drifted here
As we swim to land, mouths full of the sand, just say
"Baby I know"
I'm all tired and my throat's so dry
I feel I'm barely holding on
I'm gonna sit around here with this abscessed fear and say
"Baby I know"
Now there's something that I want that I'll never be
Burned out full of love
Now sometimes I lay here half awake
And say, "baby I know"
Now sometimes I lay here half awake
And say, "baby I know"
