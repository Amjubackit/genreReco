[Verse 1]
Nothing feels better than to know you
And nothing's more important than to show you
That nothing comes close to what the vibe is
Nothing's more exciting than the time spent with you
No one but you can love me true
How you love me when you love me
And you tell me everything is gonna be alright, yeah
[Pre-Chorus]
And you mean the world to me
You are my everything
And I never, no, never
Never, ever wanna know what it's like without you
[Chorus]
I wanna wake up to you every day
I think I'll feel like this forever, as long as we're together
Wanna know you each and every way
I promise to be honest when I speak to you
Wanna put you at the top of my list
Wanna walk it like I talk it, wanna give you everything
Please tell me that you're rockin' with this
You know all the ways to speak to me
