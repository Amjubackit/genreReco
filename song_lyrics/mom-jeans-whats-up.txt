[Verse 1]
You
You've got a lot on your plate this week
A lot of promises you couldn't keep
And that's just fine
[Verse 2]
I'm
Just trying not to lose my shit this time
Avoiding everything and saying I'm fine
And we're out of sync
[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm
Not sure why nothing makes me feel like getting out of bed
And I'm not sure what's going wrong inside my head
[Chorus]
I've honestly never felt this lousy in my life before
It makes no sense to me, I should be happy
Should be thankful for
The friends I have around me
The support of my fractured family
But still I'm just pretending that I'm fine
When I'm feeling lousy all the time[Bridge]
I'm such a fuck
I'm such a fucking piece of shit
And you hate me for it
[Verse 3]
We
Just haven't really been on the same page
Crossing our wires, oversensitive to everything you say to me
[Pre-Chorus]
But I
I think that I'm so self-aware, but I just overthink
But still I never realized how much it's been infecting
[Chorus]
I've honestly never felt this lousy in my life before
It makes no sense to me, I should be happy
Should be thankful for
The friends I have around me
The support of my fractured family
But still I'm just pretending that I'm fine
When I'm feeling lousy all the time
I'm feeling lousy all the time
