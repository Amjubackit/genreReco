[Verse 1: Ryan Guldemond]
Whatever happened to the young, young lovers?
One got shot and the other got lost in
Drugs and punks and blood on the street
Blo-blood on her knees, bloody history
[Verse 2: Ryan Guldemond 
with Molly Guldemond
 
and Jasmin Parkin
]
Whatever happened to the hayloft?
Burnt to the ground
, and what about Pop?
He took his ass back to the crack shack
With his
 long johns on, 
singing that old song
[Chorus: Molly Guldemond and Jasmin Parkin]
My baby's got a gun
My baby's got a gun
My baby's got a gun
I better run
My baby's got a gun
It goes
Boom boom crack
Ga-ga-ga-ga boom boom
[Verse 3: Ryan with Molly Guldemond and Jasmin Parkin]
An eye for an eye, a leg for a leg
A shot in the heart doesn't make it un-break
She really didn't wanna make it messy
She really, really didn't but the girl gone cray
