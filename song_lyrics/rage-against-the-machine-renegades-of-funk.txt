[Intro]
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now
We're the renegades of this atomic age
This atomic age of renegades
Renegades of this atomic age
This atomic age of renegades
[Verse 1]
Since the Prehistoric ages and the days of ancient Greece
Right down through the Middle Ages
Planet Earth kept going through changes
And then no renaissance came (Came)
And times continued to change (Change)
Nothing stayed the same, but there were always renegades
Like 
Chief Sitting Bull
, 
Tom Paine
Dr. Martin Luther King, Malcolm X
They were renegades of their time and age
So many renegades!
[Chorus]
We're the Renegades of funk
We're the Renegades of funk
We're the Renegades of funk
We're the Renegades of funk
