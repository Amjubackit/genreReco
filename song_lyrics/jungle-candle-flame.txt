[Intro]
I want you there
I want you there
I want you there
I want you there
[Refrain]
You got me burning like a candle flame
You're gonna hurt because you never change
Take me from the darkness tryna heal my pain
Hear my prayer, hear my prayer
(Let's go)
You (Yes I did it for)
You (Yes I did it for)
You (Yes I did it for)
You (Yes I did it for)
[Verse 1]
Feels like the first time I made time in a minute
Rock with it, I'm in attendance
How can we put these feelings aside
I gotta match the fires to the flame
The feelings just got attached
I got the days for the stray far away
Smoulder waves, we started dancing
Know we had to take you back home
Time movin' slow, we fast forward
[Refrain]
You got me burning like a candle flame
You're gonna hurt because you never change
Take me from the darkness tryna heal my pain
Hear my prayer, hear my prayer
[Verse 2]
Butterflies in her belly is sign it's angelic
I ride the mic steady the most to try get it
Lover without limits, the message is all with it
Round and round with me, but baby don't mind spinning, word
Put in work and then we twirl, shawty could be my girl
Look at this little girl, she precious like little pearls, hair straighter than curls
Beautiful cause you earned it, making this thing worth it
[Refrain]
You got me burning like a candle flame
You're gonna hurt because you never change
Take me from the darkness tryna heal my pain
Hear my prayer, hear my prayer
[Bridge]
I want you there
I want you there
I want you there
I want you there
[Refrain]
You got me burning like a candle flame
You're gonna hurt because you never change
Take me from the darkness tryna heal my pain
Hear my prayer, hear my prayer
