[Intro: James Murphy, 
Nancy Whang
, and 
Both
]
Climbing the down escalator
To the 
frigid
 
bardo
 
(Up, up, up, up, up, up)
Rise 
(Up, up, up, up, up, up)
Kidnap yourself 
(Up!)
Don't call the fuzz
Just counting the bills
You've got 
fives, tens, twenties, fifties
Hundreds, hundreds, hundreds, hundreds
[Verse 1]
Yeah, I need a new body, I need a new body
I need a bit of shape and a tone
Ooh, ooh
Yeah, I need a new body, I need a new body
I can't shake sleeping alone
You see, I have been misplaced
I have been mislaid
Like a covetous dog that you can't just leave in your home
Yeah, I need a new lover, I need a new body
I can't stay out too long
Like my hands have gone numb
[Chorus 1: James Murphy & 
Nancy Whang
]
(
Pana, sonic, pana, sonic, pana, sonic, pana, sonic
)
Just give us what we want
(
Pana, sonic, pana, sonic, pana, sonic, pana, sonic
)[Verse 2]
I never deny it, no point in denying
The ransom and the defence has drained us with their expense
It's endless
Yeah, I try not to hide it, I try not to buy it
But you can't just sit on the fence
It's true
And now, I have been mispriced
I have been mispriced
Chipped and then deviced
Tagged and rinsed for lice
No, there's never a warning, I needed a warning
I try to be content
But I'm tight in the chest
[Chorus 2: James Murphy & 
Nancy Whang
]
(
Necco mini 'nilla wafers,
 Necco mini 'nilla wafers
)
(
Pana, sonic, pana, sonic, pana, sonic, pana, sonic
)
So, give us what we want
(
Necco mini 'nilla wafers, Necco mini 'nilla wafers
)
(
Pana, sonic, pana, sonic, pana, sonic, pana, sonic
)
(
Necco mini 'nilla wafers, Necco mini 'nilla wafers
)
(
Super, super, super, super, super, super, super, super
)
Please give us what we want
(
Super, super, super, super, super, super, super, super
)[Post-Chorus: James Murphy & 
Nancy Whang
]
(
Super, super, super, super, super, super, super, super
)
Over 200 miles of turnpike
3000 miles of goods
Would you like to add a protein?
Would you like to ask me about my day rates?
[Verse 3]
I need a new body, I need a new party
To represent my needs
(Ha-ha)
Yeah, the distance is growing, but so is the longing
Which leaves the inbetween
And so, this is the end, or near to the end
Let's say goodbye to a beautiful friend
Staggered and blind on the rack, on the mend
Let's close the eyes of a beautiful friend
So, I need a new love and I need a new body
To push away the end
To the water we send you
[Outro]
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Dim that light in your eyes
Coming out of your eyes
People can see it
When it pierces the veil
The pink ones at night
When it gets too much
Otherwise, too much noise
If you look up
Block out the periphery
The earth and trees surround you
Framing your escape
Into the sky
Into the stars
Leaving the ground
You feel your feet let go
The air a bit cooler now
Thinner in the lungs
Cleaner in the mouth
And you know what they say
"Don't look down"
"Don't look down"
But they also always say
Selfish, by the bed:
"Don't go to the light"
"Don't go to the light"
"Don't go to the light"
"Don't go to the light"
Well, go into the light
Go into the light
Go into the light
Go into the light
