[Intro]
Oh, I miss the misery
[Verse 1]
I've been a mess since you stayed
I've been a wreck since you changed
Don't let me get in your way
I miss the lies and the pain
The fights that keep us awake-ake-ake
I'm tellin' you
[Refrain]
I miss the bad things, the way you hate me
I miss the screamin', the way that you blame me
Miss the phone calls when it's your fault
I miss the late nights, don't miss you at all
I like the kick in the face
And the things you do to me
I love the way that it hurts
I don't miss you, I miss the misery
[Verse 2]
I've tried but I just can't take it
I'd rather fight than just fake it ('Cause I like it rough)
You know that I've had enough
I dare you to call my bluff
Can't take too much of a good thi-ing
I'm tellin' you
