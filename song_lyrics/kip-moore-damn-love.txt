[Verse 1]
It's young, crazy, stupid
It's two kids and Cupid
Target on a heart
It rolled right through
It's wild, reckless, dumb
Hitchhike, hold out your thumb
You don't know no better, got the tattoo to prove it
[Pre-Chorus]
It's climbing out your window
It's seventeen
It's picking her up in your pickup truck
It's fire and gasoline
[Chorus]
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, no you can't tell it nothing
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, it's that strong kind of something
For the bees, for the birds
No surprise, it's a four letter word
It'll heal, it'll kill, it'll hurt
I hope you're tough
Damn love
[Verse 2]
It's sunsets and cold cans
It's falling hard, but college plans
Got you fakin' that smile
But you can't let go of her hand
It's a good bye kiss in tail lights
It's phone calls and late nights
It's what I wouldn't give to be tongue-tied one more time
[Chorus]
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, no you can't tеll it nothing
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, it's that strong kind of something
For the bees, for the birds
No surprisе, it's a four letter word
It'll heal, it'll kill, it'll hurt
I hope you're tough
Damn love, damn love
[Post-Chorus]
Ooh (Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na)
[Bridge]
It's the best and your worst friend
Keeps you hanging on to the end
It'll sure mess you up
Yeah, damn love
[Chorus]
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, no you can't tell it nothing
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, it's that strong kind of something
For the bees, for the birds
No surprise, it's a four letter word
It'll heal, it'll kill, it'll hurt
I hope you're tough
Damn love
Damn love
