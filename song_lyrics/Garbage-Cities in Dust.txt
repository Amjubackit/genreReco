[Verse 1]
Water was running, children were running
You were running out of time
Under the mountain, a golden fountain
Were you praying at the Lares' shrine?
[Chorus]
Ohh, oh your city lies in dust
But ohh, oh your city lies in dust
My friend
[Verse 2]
We found you hiding, we found you lying
Choking on the dirt and sand
Your former glories and all the stories
Dragged and washed with eager hands
[Chorus]
But ohh, oh your city lies in dust
Ohh, oh your city lies in dust
My friend
My friend
[Verse 3]
Water was running, children were running
We found you hiding, we found you lying
Water was running, children wer–µ running
We found you hiding, we found you lying
