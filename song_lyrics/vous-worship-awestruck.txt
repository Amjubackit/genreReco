[Verse 1]
Before I was formed, You knew my name
I was held in Your hands, and still today
You know me better
Than anyone could
[Verse 2]
From the moment I rise and through the night
You sing over me and breathe new life
With no hesitation
You're always waitin'
[Chorus]
I'm awestruck in wonder
I never knew love could feel like this
More than I wanted
Jesus, I can't get over it
[Verse 3]
One thing I ask, this I seek
To gaze on Your beauty and majesty
To dwell in Your presence
And livе for Your glory
[Chorus]
Awestruck in wonder
I nevеr knew love could feel like this
More than I wanted
Jesus, I can't get over it
I'm awestruck in wonder
I never knew love could feel like this
More than I wanted
Jesus, I can't get over it
[Bridge]
I'm so in love with You
So in love with You, ooh, oh, ayy
I'm so in love with You, ooh, oh-oh-oh
So in love with You
It's always been You
Every season of life, every long restless night
It's always been You
The highs and the lows, the ebbs and the flows
It's always been You
The smile on my face, the joy I can't shake
It's always been You
The song of my soul, the one thing I know
I'm so in love with You
I'm so in love with You
[Chorus]
I'm awestruck in wonder
I never knew love could feel like this
More than I wanted
Jesus, I can't get over it
[Post-Chorus]
It's always been You
Every season of life, every long restless night
It's always been You
The highs and the lows, the ebbs and the flows
It's always been You
The smile on my face, the joy I can't shake
It's always been You
The song of my soul, the one thing I know
