[Verse 1]
Are you looking to be alone
Or can I sit with you a while?
I don't want to be a stranger anymore
And you won't even have to smile
We can talk about the rain
How it can't seem to stop
Something stupid like the football game
Or I can tell you where to shop
[Chorus 1]
We're running out of options
It's time to close the tab
If you insist on being lonely
Let me put you in a cab
[Verse 2]
Are you looking for something easy?
Do you need to feel alive?
Do you crave a love that tears through your life
Like a Category 5?
My mama spent every day alone
In a house with noise and names
She got so tired of putting out fires
She just laid down in the flames
[Chorus 2]
We're running out of options
I've told you all my jokes
If you insist on being lonely
Can you leave a couple smokes?
[Verse 3]
I could lie to you all night
Say I saw you in a dream
We don't have to get to know each other better
Let it be just how it seems
I won't ask you for your number
Don't even need to know your name
I'm too tired to get excited
And I'm too old to be ashamed
[Chorus 3]
We're running out of options
I'll give you time to think
If you insist on being lonely
Let me leave you to your drink
[Chorus 4]
We're running out of options
I'll wait outside the door
If you insist on being lonely
I might wait a minute more
