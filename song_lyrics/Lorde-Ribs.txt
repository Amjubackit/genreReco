[Verse 1]
The drink you spilt all over me
"Lover's Spit" left on repeat
My mum and dad let me stay home
It drives you crazy, getting old
[Pre-Chorus]
We can talk it so good
We can make it so divine
We can talk it good
How you wish it would be all the time
[Chorus 1]
The drink you spilt all over me
"Lover's Spit" left on repeat
My mum and dad let me stay home
It drives you crazy, getting old
The drink you spilt all over me
"Lover's Spit" left on repeat
My mum and dad let me stay home
It drives you crazy, getting old
[Verse 2]
This dream isn't feeling sweet
We're reeling through the midnight streets
And I've never felt more alone
It feels so scary, getting old
