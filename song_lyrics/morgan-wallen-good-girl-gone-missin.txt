[Verse 1]
Bar lights, bar stool
Too many, one fool
Long neck, long hair
Last call, we the first ones outta there
Coulda been the right one but it went wrong, wrong, wrong
And I bet I know just what to blame it on
[Chorus]
Good whiskey, bad decisions
Heartaches from some hard livin'
'Bout as good as I'll be gettin'
Don't know why it always goes like
She's fallin', I'm quittin'

Good girl, gone missin'

And I'll never know if she loved me 'cause I don't know how to hold on
'Cause of
[Chorus]
Good whiskey, bad decisions
Heartaches from some hard livin'
'Bout as good as I'll be gettin'
Don't know why it always goes like
She's fallin', I'm quittin'
Knew better, didn't listen
New story, same endin'
Good girl, gone missin'
[Outro]
Good girl, gone missin'
Good girl, gone missin'
