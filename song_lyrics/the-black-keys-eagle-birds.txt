[Verse 1]
See twin eagle birds up in the tree
One for you and there's one for me
When we thought we might be losing our minds
We saw the signs
[Chorus]
Don't nobody wanna be lonely
Everybody oughta be loved sometime
[Verse 2]
Feel you simmer down in the pan
Feed me dinner right out of your hand
All night long, I had you on my mind
Flying high
[Chorus]
Don't nobody wanna be lonely
Everybody oughta be loved sometime
She love me right (Woo)
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 3]
You can search forever, you might never find
A love so real that will heal like mine
Eagle bird, I heard you fly on by
Late last night
