[Chorus: Tyler Childers & The Food Stamps]
Give me that old time screamin' and a-shoutin'
Go up, tell it on the mountain
Faith too strong to be left doubtin'
Way of the triune God
[Verse 1: Tyler Childers]
I don't need the pills you take just to feel the spirit movin'
Brother, I ain't slept in days all without the drugs you're usin'
Fit me for the builder's use, use me for the great commission
As it was and always will, as it is, I'm here to witness that
[Chorus: Tyler Childers & The Food Stamps]
Old time screamin' and a-shoutin'
Go up, tell it on the mountain
Faith too strong to be left doubtin'
Way of the triune God
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 2: Tyler Childers]
I don't need the laws of man to tell me what I ought to do
He retched down and touchеd my hand and gave me quite a talkin' to
Gavе it to me strict in charge, somethin' simple I could ponder
'Til the roll is called on high, 'til we all meet over yonder[Chorus: Tyler Childers & The Food Stamps]
Old time screamin' and a-shoutin'
Go up, tell it on the mountain
Faith too strong to be left doubtin'
Way of the triune God
[Verse 3: Tyler Childers & 
The Food Stamps
]
I don't need the pills you take (
Old time screamin' and a shoutin'
)
Just to feel the spirit movin' (
Go up, tell it on the mountain
)
Brother, I ain't slept in days (
Faith too strong to be left doubtin'
)
All without the drugs you're usin' (
Way of the triune God
)
Fit me for the builder's use (
Old time screamin' and a-shoutin'
)
Use me for the great commission (
Go up, tell it on the mountain
)
As it was and always will (
Faith too strong to be left doubtin'
)
As it is, I'm here to witness that (
Way of the triune God
)

[Verse 4: Tyler Childers]
Jesus said he'd go before and come back when the house was finished
All this sin and wagin' war, my God's comin' any minute
[Chorus: Tyler Childers & The Food Stamps]
Old time screamin' and a-shoutin'
Go up, tell it on the mountain
Faith too strong to be left doubtin'
Way of the triune God
Give me that old time screamin' and a-shoutin'
Go up, tell it on the mountain
Faith too strong to be left doubtin'
Way of the triune God
Way of the triune God
Way of the triune God
