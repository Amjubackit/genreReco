At first, I was afraid, I was afraid
Down in the darkness I was crawling through the human race
I heard the voices through the dark (oh oh oh oh oh oh oh)
So I beat my fist against my chest against my heart
Hey-ho!
Hear the sound
We are the underground
Hey-ho!
Rising up
We're not afraid of fighting
I’ve finally found my place
I put the war paint on my face
And I'm ready to give (hey!) whatever it takes
Standing at the edge of the fire
Fighting for the will to survive
I feel it burning under my skin
And I'm back on my feet again
This is the feeling
I can’t believe it
My heart is bleeding out
Now I'm dangerous
Feeding the fire
Higher and higher
Rising up, rising up
Now I'm dangerous
