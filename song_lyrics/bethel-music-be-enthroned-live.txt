[Intro]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
[Verse 1]
We've come to join the song
Sung long before our lives
To raise our voice along
Heaven and earth alike
[Verse 2]
And we've seen Your faithful hand
Your mercy without end
And a King who bled and died
And a God who sacrificed
[Chorus]
And be enthroned upon the praises of a thousand generations
You are worthy, Lord of all
Unto You the slain and risen King
We lift our voice with heaven
Singing worthy, Lord of all
[Verse 3]
All through this life we lead
And on to eternity
Our endless praise we'll cry
Jesus, be glorified
And all through this life we lead
And on to eternity
And our endless praise we'll cry
Jesus, be glorified
Jesus, be glorified
[Chorus]
Be enthroned upon the praises of a thousand generations
You are worthy, Lord of all
And unto You the slain and risen King
We lift our voice with heaven
Singing worthy, Lord of all
And be enthroned upon the praises of a thousand generations
You are worthy, Lord of all
Unto You the slain and risen King
We lift our voice with heaven
Singing worthy, Lord of all
[Interlude]
Yes, You are worthy, Jesus
The only One, the only One who is worthy
[Bridge]
And highest praises, Lord of all
And highest praises, Lord of all
And highest praises, Lord of all
(We bring to You) The highest praises, Lord of all
And highest praises, Lord of all
(We sing, yeah) Highest praises, Lord of all
And highest praises, Lord of all
Highest praises
You are worthy, Lord of all
[Chorus]
Be enthroned upon the praises of a thousand generations
You are worthy, Lord of all
Unto You the slain and risen King
We lift our voice with heaven
Singing worthy, Lord of all, yeah-oh
You are worthy, God, You're so worthy
Hey-oh-oh-oh, yeah-yeah
And be enthroned upon the praises of a thousand generations
You are worthy, Lord of all
And unto You the slain and risen King
We lift our voice with heaven
Singing worthy, Lord of all
Lord of all
