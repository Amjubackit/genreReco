[Verse 1]
I watched you change
Into a fly
I looked away
You were on fire
[Chorus]
And I watched a change in you
It's like you never had wings
Now you feel so alive
I've watched you change
[Verse 2]
I took you home
Set you on the glass
I pulled off your wings
Then I laughed
[Chorus]
And I watched a change in you
It's like you never had wings
Now you feel so alive
I've watched you change
[Bridge]
It's like you never had wings
Ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah
