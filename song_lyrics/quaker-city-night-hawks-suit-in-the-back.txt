Boy you got to lose something if you wanna live that way
Boy you got to lose something if you wanna live that way
Pulled up in the grass just off the interstate
Ain't said nothing in a minute
It's his second and he's gonna teach a lesson
Bout the message and how they send it
Boy you got to lose something if you wanna live that way
Well my mind is racing through bout fifteen different places
I'm not sure if I can keep it all hid
But that suit in the back has gotta loaded jacket boy
And we know you don't write with that pen
And you got to lose something if you wanna live that way
You got to lose something if you wanna live that way
Well my mind is racing through bout fifteen different places
I'm not sure if I can keep it all hid
But that suit in the back has gotta loaded jacket boy and we know you don't write with that pen
You got to lose something if you wanna live that way
You got to lose something if you wanna live that way
Lose something
If you wanna live that way
Lose something
If you wanna live that way
