[Verse 1: CeCe Winans & 
Lauren Daigle
]
They say this mountain can't be moved
They say these chains will never break
But they don't know You like we do
There is power in Your name
We've heard that there is no way through
We've heard the tide will never change
They haven't seen what You can do
There is power in Your name
So much power in Your name
[Chorus: CeCe Winans, 
CeCe Winans & Lauren Daigle
]
Move the unmovable
Break the unbrеakable
God, we beliеve
God, we believe for it
From the impossible
We'll see a miracle
God, we believe
God, we believe for it
[Verse 2: Lauren Daigle & 
CeCe Winans
]
We know that hope is never lost (
Oh-oh-oh
)
For there is still an empty grave
God, we believe no matter what
There is power in Your name
So much power in Your name
