"
Mr. Durst?
"
"Yeah?"
"
We need your help. Pulling into the diner about now should be four top-secret agents. One of them is carrying a briefcase. Your mission is to obtain the disc from the briefcase.

[Verse 1]
All the tension in the world today
All the little girls fillin' up the world today
When the good comes to bad, the bad comes to good
But I'ma live my life like I should (Like I should)
Now all the critics wanna hit it
Ya shit can how we did it, just because they don't get it
But I'll stay fitted, new era committed
Now this red cap gets a rap from these critics
But do we always gotta cry?
Do we always gotta live inside a lie?
Life's just a blast that's movin' really fast
You better stay on top or life will kick you in the ass
Follow me into a solo
Remember that, kid? So what you wanna do?
And where you gonna run when you're starin' down the cable of a
Mic pointed at your grill like a gun?
Limp Bizkit is rockin' the set
It's like Russian Roulette, when you're placin', you bet
So don't be upset when you're broke and you're done
'Cause I'ma be the one till I jet (I'ma be the one till I jet)
