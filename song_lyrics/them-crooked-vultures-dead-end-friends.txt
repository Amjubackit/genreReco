[Verse 1: Josh Homme]
I drive all alone at night
I drive all alone
Don't know what I'm headed for
I follow the road, blind
Until the road is dead end
Night's in my veins, it's callin' me
Racing along these arteries, and
[Chorus 1: Josh Homme]
Law is just a myth
To herd us over the cliff
[Verse 2: Josh Homme]
I follow the road at night
Just hoping to find
Which puzzle piece fell out of me
I know who you are, and I
Open the door and climb in
Hold me real close and do it again
Ache for the touch of my dead end friends
[Chorus 2: Josh Homme with Dave Grohl]
And oh, I gotta know
Is it dead at the end of the road?
I can tell by the look in your eyes
We're the same, my dead end friends and I
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 3: Josh Homme]
We drive all alone at night
A never-ending begin
Sweet as a curse just out of reach
Awakens the dead end part of me
[Chorus 3: Josh Homme with Dave Grohl]
And oh, no more wandering
Just me and my dead end friends again
Yeah
[Bridge: Josh Homme]
Dead end friends
Dead end friends
Dead end friends
Dead
