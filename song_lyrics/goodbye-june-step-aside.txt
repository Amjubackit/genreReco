[Verse 1]
Mom and daddy traveled around
Preaching and teaching the gospel
We settled down in a shitty town
A broken home and a bible, yeah
[Verse 2]
I've been everywhere since then
I saw what really mattered
Now when I look back on all that pain
It brings me laughter
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm in love
With the sweet, sweet, sweet sunshine
Ain't no fool
And it's time for me to take what's mine, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh
[Chorus]
It's time
It's mine
All mine, yeah
Step aside
Stеp aside
[Verse 3]
All my friends went to collеge
Then got jobs and kids and wives
But I found peace in this guitar
Gonna play it 'til I die[Pre-Chorus]
Still in love
With the sweet, sweet, sweet sunshine
Ain't no fool
And it's time for me to take what's mine, yeah, yeah, yeah
[Chorus]
It's time
It's mine
All mine
Step aside
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm in love
With the sweet, sweet, sweet sunshine
Ain't no fool
And it's time for me to take what's mine, oh
[Chorus]
It's time
It's mine
All mine
Step aside, yeah
It's time
It's mine
All mine
Step aside
