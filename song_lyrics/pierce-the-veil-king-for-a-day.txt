[Verse 1: Vic Fuentes & 
Kellin Quinn
]
Dare me to jump off of this Jersey bridge
I bet you never had a Friday night like this
Keep it up, keep it up, let's raise our hands
I take a look up at the sky and I see red
Red for the cancer, red for the wealthy
Red for the drink that's mixed with suicide
Everything red
[Pre-Chorus: Kellin Quinn]
Please, won't you push me for the last time?
Let's scream until there's nothing left
So sick of playing, I don't want this anymore
The thought of you's no fucking fun
You want a martyr? I'll be one
Because enough's enough, we're done
[Chorus: Vic Fuentes]
You told me, "Think about it," well, I did
Now I don't wanna feel a thing anymore
I'm tired of begging for the things that I want
I'm over sleeping like a dog on the floor
[Post-Chorus: Vic Fuentes]
Yeah!
