[Verse 1]
Am I so easily distracted again?
Or am I a slave to things that don't, matte-e-e-er?
Am I so easily distracted again?
Or am I a slave to things that don’t, matte-e-e-er, oh-oh-oh?
[Chorus]
But I know that
You are my portion, You are my portion
When I lay down my life
You're my portion, You're my portion
[Interlude]
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
[Verse 2]
I’ll never doubt Your smile
Or turn from the love you've shown me, oh-oh-oh-oh
I'll never doubt Your smile, Father
Or turn from the love You've shown me, oh-oh-oh-oh
[Interlude]
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
[Chorus]
You are my portion, You're my portion
When I lay down my life
You're my portion, You're my portion
You are my portion, You're my portion
When I lay down my life
You’re my portion, You’re my portion
[Bridge]
Your eyes are on fire
I can't look away
Your eyes are on fire
I can’t look away
Your eyes are on fire
I can't look awa-a-ay
Your eyes are on fire
I can't look away
[Chorus]
'Cause You are my portion, You’re my portion
When I lay down my life
You're my portion, You're my portion
[Bridge]
Your eyes are on fire
I can't look awa-a-ay
Your eyes are on fire
I can't look away
[Chorus]
'Cause You are my portion, You're my portion
When I lay down my life
You're my portion, You're my portion
