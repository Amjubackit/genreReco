[Verse 1]
Old things have passed away
I am a new bein'
Nothing remains the same
Startin’ over again
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[Refrain]
Can you imagine
After all that you've been through, that there's still so much more?
You can’t even fathom
'Cause it's looking like the end, but you're just getting started
Dusting off the past
Healing from the pain and [the breaking?] in the ashes
'Cause nothing's ever wasted, it's true
[Chorus]
He makes all things new (Woo!)
He makes all things new
You say, "He makes all things new" (Yeah)
He makes all things new (Yeah)
[Verse 2]
So glad He changed my name (Ooh)
I'll never be the same (Ooh)
Since Jesus came my way (Ooh)
It’s been a brand new day (Ooh)
