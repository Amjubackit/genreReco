[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh-uh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh-uh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh-uh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Now I've got task on a nigga's ass, tell me, will they blast me?
I think of an alias in case these crooked bitches ask me
Now, it's gettin' crazy after dark, these narcs
Be, like, tryna shut me down, but I'm too smart
Now picture me scared of the penitentiary
I've been movin' these things since the days of elementary
Now tell me what you need when you see me
I'm stackin' Gs, buyin' all the things on TV, believe me
I got some killas on my payroll and they know
When it's time to handle business, nigga, lay low
Although I'm young, I'm still comin' up
I'm gettin' paid, pullin' razors on niggas when they runnin' up
The first to pull a strap when there's drama, busta, you ain't heard?
I been slicin' motherfuckers since I lost my mama
There ain't a cop that can stop me
My posse is cock-D and they don't quit until they drop me, I'm loyal to the game[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh-uh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh-uh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh-uh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
[Verse 2: Treach]
Without no doubt, I ain't no slouch and it ain't time to back out, so I jumps in it
Try to stop her and watch her, slap you cock-eye like Popeye, fuck spinach (Hahaha)
Forgotten more shit than most crews ever know or ever knew
Was born with seven flows and only Heaven knew
For Pete and boots' sakes, the news break, then you shakes, uh
Worse, they heard we got more nerve than a toothache
Yoo-hoo to you crew and, uh, you too, so you knew
I'm from Jersey and all my team's on your block more than you do
Who's the new crew? Show me your neck brotha, and here's another
Smack your mother's mamma's mother and the first mom of all those other crack lovers
Back was bitch-ass, trick-ass, cluck-clow, cluck-clow
How ya like me then, how ya like me, hey-ho, how ya like me now?
Ow, pow, hurt, don't it? Bow, bow, don't run up on it
The same thing, mine has been hangin' possies like an exponent
Oh yes, rock in slums, ya gots to run it
It makes no sense to smell like shit if old-ass George could be washing tons[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh-uh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh-uh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh-uh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
[Verse 3: Riddler]
Now I be loyal to my niggas on the block, just buckin' the shots and packin' the Glocks
And dodgin' the cops, and takin' over niggas spots
Poppin' after poppin', the fools be droppin', the hoes be hoppin'
On my thing 'cause it hangs like the nets from 
Above the Rim
You lookin' grim, is it me or him or him
Or be with me, we be together, so what's up? We can do whatever
'Cause real niggas stick together 'til they make it up to Heaven
Through the stress, through the hell, 
through the 1-8-7
The shorter the nigga, the bigga the trigga, the deeper they dig the ditch, uh
The Naughty, the Treach, then through to the Pac, I brings the Glock, I wets up
You fuckin' body, I'm like, "Oh my Gotti
Did I really shoot him? Yo, I shot him," so I got him, now I puts the crime behind me
And finds me a place to lays my head low
I lives doin' my rap, but I dies for my hood, bro
So all you fuckin' fools best to recognize and know my fuckin' name
I be Riddler to my niggas and I'm loyal to the game[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh-uh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh-uh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh-uh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh-uh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh-uh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh-uh
Yeah
