[Verse 1: Roxanne Clifford]
When I took you back, I thought you'd only up and run
But you're still here, I know
And when I took you back, I thought you'd only up and run
But you're still here, you're still here
[Chorus: Roxanne Clifford]
And now everything goes my way
And now everything goes my way
It feels so good to have you back, my love
I'm in love again (Love again)
Love, I'm in love again (Love again)
[Verse 2: Roxanne Clifford & 
Joseph Mount
]
I'd given up on you, you shot a hole in my heart straight through
When you pushed me aside, three weeks I cried
But now you've got me back, you know I'll never up and run
Yeah, I'll stay here, I'll stay right here
[Chorus: Roxanne Clifford]
And now everything goes my way
And now everything goes my way
It feels so good to have you back, my love
I'm in love again (Love again)
Love, I'm in love again (Love again)
[Outro: Roxanne Clifford]
Love, I'm in love again
Love, I'm in love again
Love, I'm in love again
Love, I'm in love again
Love, I'm in love again
Love, I'm in love again
Love, I'm in love again
Love, I'm in love again
Love, I'm in love again
Love...
