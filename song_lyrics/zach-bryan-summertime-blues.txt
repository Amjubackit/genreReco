[Verse 1]
The sun set so late tonight
I wonder if you saw it too
Wish I still had someone to lose
All I got are these summertime blues
Bet there's a green-eyed, dark-haired beauty
On some beach by Monterey
Lettin' waves wash her pain away
But I'll never know
Bet there's some boys out in Okie
That are prayin' to get the job done
Haulin' hay and fightin' off the sun
With ladies waitin' in town
[Chorus]
My summertime blues, summertime blues
I've got nothin' left to prove
I'm out of touch and out of tune
Singin' alone
To the birds up high and the souls below
All those boys who ain't got no home
The beautiful girls I'll never hold
This one's for you
My summertime blues
My summertime blues[Verse 2]
The quiet turns to revelry
As the sun burns away the spring
The coastlines start to sing
With the young and heartless
Hilton head and the Hamptons
Where the rich all go to die
The young kids all get high
Just to pass time
I bought a bottle of the best bourbon
A beat-down boy could buy
I'm gonna bury all my sorrow
As the summertime passes by
[Chorus]
Summertime blues, summertime blues
I've got nothin' left to prove
I'm out of touch and out of tune
Singin' alone
To the birds up high and the souls below
All those boys who ain't got no home
The beautiful girls I'll never hold
This one's for you
My summertime blues
My summertime blues[Outro]
The sun set so late tonight
I wonder if you saw it too
Wish I still had someone to lose
All I got are these summertime blues
