[Verse 1]
You go before I know
That You've even gone to win my war
You come back with the head of my enemy
You come back and You call it my victory
[Verse 2]
You go before I know
That You've even gone to win my war
Your love becomes my greatest defense
It leads me from the dry wilderness
[Pre-Chorus]
And all I did was praise
And all I did was worship
And all I did was bow down
And all I did was stay still
[Chorus]
And hallelujah, You have saved me
So much better Your way
And hallelujah, Great Defender
So much better this way
[Verse 3]
You know before I do
Where my heart can seek to find Your truth
Your mercy is the shade I'm living in
You restore my faith and hope again[Pre-Chorus]
And all I did was praise
And all I did was worship
And all I did was bow down
And all I did was stay still
[Chorus]
And hallelujah, You have saved me
So much better Your way
And hallelujah, Great Defender
So much better this way (Hallelujah)
And hallelujah, You have saved me
So much better Your way
And hallelujah, Great Defender
So much better this way
[Interlude]
[Bridge]
When I thought I lost me
You knew where I left me
You reintroduced me to Your love
And You picked up all my pieces
Put me back together
You are the defender of my heart
And when I thought I lost me
You knew where I left me
You reintroduced me to Your love
And You picked up all my pieces
Put me back together
You are the defender of my heart
When I thought I lost me
You knew where I left me
You reintroduced me to Your love
You picked up all my pieces
You put me back together
You are the defender of my heart[Chorus]
And hallelujah, You have saved me
So much better Your way
And hallelujah, Great Defender
So much better this way (Hallelujah)
And hallelujah, You have saved me
So much better Your way
And hallelujah, Great Defender
So much better this way
[Bridge]
When I thought I lost me
You knew where I left me
You reintroduced me to Your love
And You picked up all my pieces
Put me back together
You are the defender of my heart (Sing that one more time)
When I thought I lost me
You knew where I left me
You reintroduced me to Your love
And You picked up all my pieces
Put me back together
You are the defender of my heart
[Spontaneous]
Every time
This happens every time
Every time I fall apart
You pick up the pieces and make them beautiful
Every time, every time
This always happens
Always happens
Every time
Not just one time, not just a few times
Every time
Every time
Every time...
