[Intro: Riley Keough]
Ooh-ah
[Verse 1: Riley Keough]
I still need a drink for all the glasses in the sink
From chasin' a shot that rang through hell
For the record, I'm fine with what's left of what's mine
Almost took you by mistake for someone else
[Pre-Chorus: Riley Keough]
You're just a wild guess in a see-through dress
I don't wanna hear you squealin' up my drive
It took guts to think that I would buy that wink
But that little thing you do just ain't right
[Chorus: Sam Claflin, Riley Keough]
(More fun to miss) Than to be with
(You're more fun to kiss) Than to be with
(More fun to miss) Than to be with
[Post-Chorus]
Ooh-ah, ooh-ah
Ooh-ah, ooh-ah
Ooh-ah, ooh-ah
[Verse 2: Riley Keough]
You're still up at night, upside-down and up-right
It must be how your little mind gets fed
Now, do I shoot straight or do I cheat fate?
Oh, it does a number on my head
[Pre-Chorus: Riley Keough]
But I don't pull tricks, last time I hit a lick
Was when I heard the church bells a-chimin'
But you'd be just as fun as a jammed-up gun
Another shot at just the wrong place and time
[Chorus: Sam Claflin, Riley Keough]
(More fun to miss) Than to be with
(You're more fun to kiss) Than to be with
(More fun to miss) Than to be with
[Post-Chorus]
Ooh-ah, ooh-ah
Ooh-ah, ooh-ah
Ooh-ah, ooh-ah
Ooh-ah
[Chorus: Riley Keough, Sam Claflin]
You'll be more fun to miss (Than to be with)
You'll be more fun to kiss (Than to be with)
You'll be more fun to miss (Than to be with)
You'll be more fun to miss
[Post-Chorus]
Ooh-ah, ooh-ah
Ooh-ah, ooh-ah
Ooh-ah, ooh-ah
Ooh-ah
