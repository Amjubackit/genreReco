[Chorus]
Our God (Yeah, yeah) is an awesome God
He reigns (Got 'em) from Heaven above
With wisdom (Haha), power and love
Our God is an awesome God (Our God is awesome, our God is awesome, let's go)
Our God (Uh) is an awesome God (Hey)
He reigns (Yeah) from Heaven above
With wisdom, power and love
Our God is an awesome God (Yeah, hey, uh)
[Verse 1]
All power, He contains it, the Man on his own
Abandoned the throne to approach the cross stainless
Death couldn't shake Him or derail, three nails
Could pierce, but couldn't break Him or make Him appear taken
Away from his mere nature, not
While slumber is hovering over the block I pray that my peers wake up
We were born out of alignment the perfect timing
Is now to check for a pulse if you ain't rocked by Him
I am prone to be biased when I peep the timeline
Behind Him and see no highness as high as Him
He reigns Lord firearms are too short to aim for Him
Call Him extreme as he leaks Katrinas when he's brainstorming
That's quite enormous to say the least
Our God is a beast, His wrath is the sound of a lion roaring
Since He's topped by none
I'm on hip-hop's front line screaming from the top of my lungs, "Our God"
