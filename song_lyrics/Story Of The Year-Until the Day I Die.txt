[Intro]
Until the day I die
I'll spill my heart for you, for you
Until the day I die
I'll spill my heart for you
[Verse 1]
As years go by
I'd race the clock with you
But if you died right now
You know that I'd die too
I'd die too
You remind me of the times
When I knew who I was
But still the second hand will catch us
Like it always does
We'll make the same mistakes
I'll take the fall for you
I hope you need this now
Because I know I still do
[Chorus]
Until the day I die
I'll spill my heart for you
Until the day I die
I'll spill my heart for you
