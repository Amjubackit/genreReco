[Verse 1]
Miracles when You move
Such an easy thing for You to do
Your hand is moving right now
You are still showing up
At the tomb of every Lazarus
Your voice is calling me out
[Pre-Chorus]
And right now, I know You're able
And my God, come through again
[Chorus]
You can do all things
You can do all things but fail
'Cause You've never lost a battle
No, You've never lost a battle
And I know, I know
You never will, mm
[Verse 2]
Everything's possible
By the power of the Holy Ghost
A new wind is blowing right now (Oh, yes)
Breaking my heart of stone
Taking over like it's Jericho
And my walls are all crashing down
