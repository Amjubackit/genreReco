[Verse 1]
First grade (First grade)
Somebody tied you to an ant pile (Ant pile)
And that wasn't even the worst day (Uh-huh)
Back then you knew I always liked you (Uh-huh)
We went to high school (Uh-huh)
And on the first day (First day)
You pushed me up against the brick wall (Brick wall)
You pushed me up against the locker (Locker)
Said let's get home before your mom does (Uh-huh)
Know what your mom does (Uh-huh)
[Verse 2]
She takes a different lover every day
She threw her wedding ring away
But you still love your mama, don't you?
Daniella, she smokes so much nowadays
Sometimes the pipe, but mostly Camels (Mostly Camels)
Sometime around eighth grade remember our bodies were changing
[Chorus]
You looked at me different
(In the middle of, in the middle of)
And held me like you missed me
(In the middle of, in the middle of)
We started to feel different
(In the middle of, in the middle of)
And that was when you kissed me
(In the middle of, in the middle of)
