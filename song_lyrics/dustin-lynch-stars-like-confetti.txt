[Verse 1]
There we were
In the back of that old Z-71
The road was dirt
A couple kids waitin' on the sun
Cherry red
Baby, I still recall the taste
We were a few beers shy of freedom
I had my hands around your waist
[Pre-Chorus]
You said, "Babe, I'm gettin' cold"
I said, "Climb on in my jacket"
You already know
Like my heart, you can have it
[Chorus]
Oh, I don't remember what the radio was playin'
I was hangin' like the moon on all the words your lips were sayin'
All I know is there was magic in that Chevy
Baby, you were glowin', God was throwin'
Stars like confetti, ah
Stars like confеtti, ah
[Verse 2]
Yeah, rusted truck, dusted-up boots
And high on a pеrfume buzz
That see-forever sky wasn't near as high as us
Yeah, our hearts were beatin' faster
Than a runaway midnight train
We couldn't say forever
But we said it anyway
[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, hold me tight and never let me go
Look up at the sky, Heaven's puttin' on a show
[Chorus]
I don't remember what the radio was playin'
I was hangin' like the moon on all the words your lips were sayin'
All I know is there was magic in that Chevy
Baby, you were glowin', God was throwin'
Stars like confetti, ah
We made a wish on everyone, ah
We held on 'til it was done, woah
[Chorus]
I don't remember what the radio was playin'
I was hangin' like the moon on all the words you're sayin'
All I know is there was magic in that Chevy
Baby, you were glowin', God was throwin'
Stars like confetti, ah
Stars like confetti, ah
I don't remember what the radio was playin'
I was hangin' like the moon on all the words your lips were sayin'
All I know is there was magic in that Chevy
Baby, you were glowin', God was throwin'
Stars like confetti, ah
We made a wish on everyone, ah
Yeah, we held on 'til it was done, woah
[Outro]
Stars like confetti, ah
No, no, no
