[Verse 1]
Open water
Just what you wanted (Just what you wanted)
So don't leave me drownin'
Don't let me, down
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't, don't hold it back like that, just pull me closer, baby
Hold on, love, let's make the most of this before it's over, over
[Chorus]
No, time
Don't wanna waste the feel
Like we could make it real
Don't run away when you could be lovin' me
Signs, too busy readin' minds
Already made it here
Don't overthink when you could be lovin' me
[Post-Chorus]
(Babe, when you could be lovin' me)
(Babe, when you could be lov—)
[Verse 2]
Get me started
Before this started? (Before this started)
I could be givin' someone all of me
Totally (Totally), totally, oh
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't, don't hold it down like that, just pull me closer, baby
So, better make the most of this before it's over, over
[Chorus]
There's no time
Don't wanna waste the feel
Like we could make it real
Don't run away when you could be lovin' me
Signs, too busy readin' minds
Already made it here
Don't overthink when you could be lovin' me
[Post-Chorus]
(Babe, when you could be lovin' me)
(Babe, when you could be—)
[Bridge]
Play it safe 'case I don't feel the same
Oh, end of the day (Oh, end of the day)
Won't face it, you too afraid to say
You're too intimidated
[Outro]
(When you could be lovin' me)
(Babe, when you could be lovin' me)
(Babe, when you could be lovin' me)
