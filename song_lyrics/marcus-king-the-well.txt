[Verse 1]
When I was just a youngin bouncin' on my mama knee
Said, "Son, there's only one thing that sets your soul free"
Wasn't no easy street where I come from
There wasn't no sleep until the work was done
[Verse 2]
Papa was a-preachin' 'bout the fires of Hell
If you want a drink of water, got to go to the well
The Cornerstone Church tried to curse my soul
But the good Lord gave me that rock and roll
[Verse 3]
Let the spirit pull me under, to the bottom of the well
You wanna live forever, but you never can tell
So, one for the money, two, another show
Three for the Father, Son and Holy Ghost
