[Verse 1]
Here's to bein' human
All the pain and sufferin'
There's beauty in the bleedin'
At least you feel somethin'
I wish I knew what it was like
To care enough to carry on
I wish I knew what it was like
To find a place where I belong
[Chorus]
But I am machine, I never sleep
I keep my eyes wide open
I am machine, a part of me
Wishes I could just feel somethin'
I am machine, I never sleep
Until I fix what's broken
I am machine, a part of me
Wishes I could just feel somethin'
[Verse 2]
Here's to bein' human
Takin' it for granted
The highs and lows of livin'
To getting second chances
I wish I knew what it was like
To care about what's right or wrong
I wish someone could help me find
Find a place where I belong
