[Verse 1]
The atmosphere is changing
Nothing stays the same
Heaven is waiting
For the mention of the Name
The Spirit is moving
Burning like a flame
Healing the broken
By the One we proclaim
[Pre-Chorus]
Raise it up
Fill the sky
Chains will fall
Mountains move
We lift Him high
[Chorus]
Speak the Name
The Name above all other names
Speak the Name
The Name the wind and waves obey
All of heaven's coming down
Fill the earth with a sound
Of the Name
The Name of Jesus
