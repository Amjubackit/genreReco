Out on the porch
[Verse 1: Camel MC]
Let's have a Mid-City Fiesta with youur West LA connection
Hop inside the vehicle, start crossing intersections
We learning life's lessons while we blaze this herbal essence
A man, but still a child, and I have so many questions
Struggle all my life to evade the misconceptions
To find a place to live between the negatives and positives
While trying to make money slanging synonyms and homonyms
I went to pop's house so I can visit moms and him
Cut to the mall copped a brand new pair of Timberlands
Then dipped down a one way trying to scoop up Double K
And chill with my people on this bright and sunny day
My nigga Spliff was sippin' Beck's, I'm slappin' hands with Thes
Locate a shady spot so we can circulate the stress
Mary Jane invades my brain now I can't complain
I'm sayin what else is there to 
do be
sides relax
Let the problems in yor mind become ancient artifacts
Perhaps these raps can help you alleviate
The things that's got yo trippin you watch me demonstrate
First you ignore the nonsense and clear your conscience
Let your pen touch the paper write verbs and consonants
As the words become a sentence
 you start to feel indifferent
The stress is out your mind you feel like the weight was lifted
Terrific, I'm glad we had this time to discuss
I'm outro, call me if you want to blaze one up
