[Verse 1]
There is no pain Jesus can't feel
No hurt He cannot heal
All things work according to His perfect will
No matter what you're going through
Remember God is using You
For the battle is not yours, it's the Lord's
[Verse 2]
There's no sadness Jesus can't feel
And there is no sorrow that He cannot heal
For all things work according to the Master's holy will
No matter what you're going through
Remember that God is only using you
For this battle is not yours, it's the Lord's
[Chorus]
It's the Lord's, yes, it's the Lord's
Hold your head up high
Don't your fret, it's the Lord's
It's the Lord's, yes, it's the Lord's
[Bridge]
No matter what you're going through
Remember that God only wants to use you
No matter what you happen to go through right now
Remember that in the midst of it all
God only wants to use you
[Outro]
No matter what it is, you're going through
Hold your head up, stick your chest out
And remember He's using you
For this battle is not yours alone
This battle is not yours, no
You cannot handle it all by yourself, no, no, no, no, no, no
This battle is not yours, the Lord is the only one who can fight it
He wants to use you as His vessel so be open to Him
This battle is not yours, it's the Lord's
