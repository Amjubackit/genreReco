[Verse 1: Ruben Studdard]
Givin' honor to you first, the pastor of the church (Yeah)
My folks and friends listen to these words
See God saved me (Yeah) from myself when no one else was around
And it was only by His grace (Grace)
His mercy, His favor
'Cause I know I don't deserve
All the love He show (Oh), and how He let me know (Oh)
He never gonna leave my side
[Chorus: Deitrick Haddon]
That's why I love Him like I do, I
I love Him like I do, I
That's why I love Him like I do, I, I, I
That's why I love Him like I do, I
I love Him like I do, I
That's why I love Him like I do, I, I, I (Deitrick)
[Verse 2: Deitrick Haddon]
See I got a testimony how He saved my soul
When I was just a sinner left in the cold (Cold)
Gave me a second chance, saved me from myself
Came to my rescue when I needed help
You want to know why I love Him like I do (Like I do)
'Cause when my enemies said I was through
He took me from the bottom and put me on the top
He laid his hands on me and now I can't be stopped
