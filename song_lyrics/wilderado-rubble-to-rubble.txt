[Verse 1]
Show me your friends and I'll show you your future
Show me your scars and I can help with the suture
I can reap, must mean I can sow
I must say, you're in trouble
You're working with a surgeon who's working as a double
I have never stitched up my own
[Chorus]
But I'm on my way
You know I'll be a doctor one day
If my father only knew the steps that I take
I'm on my way
[Verse 2]
Now she's down the street sitting in sunshine
Probably smoking weed and sipping on boxed wine
She knows me but she calls me by a different name
Now she's by the fire, hanging cold stockings
I'm letting baby Jesus do most of the talking
There's a beauty in the silence that I chalk up to Christmas time
[Chorus]
Well, I'm on my way
I've got me a wife and she calls me her babe
If she only knew the steps that I take
The steps of my days
I'm on my way[Bridge]
Oh my god, I'm having a baby
I knew this day would come to finally save me
Teach me love and how to stay
Piece by piece, sew rubble to rubble
I learned how to walk by learning to stumble
Get me off the boat, I'm ready to be on land
Get me off the boat, I'm ready to be on
[Outro]
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
