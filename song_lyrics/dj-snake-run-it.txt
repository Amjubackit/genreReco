[Verse 1: Rich Brian]
Uh, rollin' in Impalas but you're too tame
I ain't from the South but I appreciate the wood grain
Neighbor callin' me about the noise it's only two, man
Now I'm in the same buildin' but the floors and view changed
I ain't for the waitin' now
I bought a 'Rari and I did it just to hear the sound
"Drive Safe" really 'bout to lose all its meanin' now
Guess you love to travel when I pull up, man, you're leavin' town
Say you're married to the game and I'm just here to burn the gown
I got a flight in the mornin'
I see what you been tryna do and I'ma mission abort it
You think I never pay attention, in my mind I'm recordin'
I'm bout to win and ruin all your goals and dreams out of boredom
Ridin' around with homies like we run the city, done it
Lookin' fresh and feelin' like a milli, money
Move in silence you can never hear me, comin'
If you got a problem when you see me, run it
[Chorus: Rich Brian, Rick Ross]
Run it
DJ Snake
Rozay
Woah
[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Bang, tryna show you what we came to do (Huh)
Boss, only talkin', makin' major moves
Rolls Royce, no top, me
No one will ever stop me
Me against the world, I got my back against the wall (Woah)
Know I'm hell bound (Woah)
But I'm well now (Woah)
On the road to riches, I could never lay around (Woah)
Told her don't make a sound, unless she make it loud (Huh)
Everybody scream, everybody scream
Everybody scream, that's my only thing, yes
I'm a born winner (Winner)
A Jordan 23 (Woo)
All my people G's until the party ceased
[Chorus: Rick Ross]
Huh (Huh)
Huh (Huh)
Huh (Huh)
Run it (Uh)
Run it
Run it
