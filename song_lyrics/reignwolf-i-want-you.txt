[Verse 1]
I've been here before
Knocking on your door like I owe you
Well, you know I'm on the killing floor
Don't act like you don't know 'cause I've told you, I've told you
[Chorus]
I want you
You know I want you
You're in my head
You're in my head
[Verse 2]
It will never be like the way it was before
You make it hard and that's not easy to ignore
I'm telling you, you
I get the feeling that you just don't understand
I'm crying wolf and I'll always be your man
I told you, I'm, I'm, I'm telling you
[Chorus]
I want you
You know I want you
You're in my head
You're in my head
I want you
You know I want you
You're in my head
You're in my head
