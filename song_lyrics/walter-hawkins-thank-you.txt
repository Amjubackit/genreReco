[Verse 1]
Tragedies are common place
All kinds of diseases, people are slipping away
Economies down
People can't get enough pay
But as for me all I can say is
Thank you Lord for all You've done for me
[Verse 2]
Folks without homes living out in the streets
And the drug habit some say, they just can't beat
Muggers and robbers, no place seems to be safe
But You've been my protection every step of the way and I want to say
Thank you Lord for all You've done for me
[Chorus]
(It could have been me) thank You
(Outdoors) thank You
(With no food) thank You
(And no clothes) thank You
(Or left alone) thank You
(Without a friend) thank You
(Or just another tragic number) thank You
(With a tragic end) thank You
(But you didn't see fit) thank You
(To let none of the things be) thank You
(Cause everyday by your power) thank You
(Your keep on keeping me) thank You
(And I want to say) thank You[Vamp 1]
I wanna thank You for Your love (thank You)
Thank you for Your power (thank You)
Thank you for protection (thank You)
Every hour (thank You)
[Vamp 2]
(I wanna thank You for love) thank You
(Thank You for Your power) thank You
(Thank You for protection) thank You
(Every hour) thank You
