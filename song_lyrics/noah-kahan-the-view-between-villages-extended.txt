[Verse 1]
Air in my lungs 'til the road begins
As the last of the bugs leave their homes again
And I'm splittin' the road down the middle
For a minute, the world seemed so simple
[Verse 2]
Feel the rush of my blood, I'm seventeen again
I am not scared of death, I've got dreams again
It's just me and the curve of the valley
And there is meanin' on earth, I am happy
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh
[Chorus]
Passed Alger Brook Road, I'm over the bridge
A minute from home, but I feel so far from it
The death of my dog, the stretch of my skin
It's all washin' over me, I'm angry again
The things that I lost here, the people I knew
They got me surrounded for a mile or two
The car's in reverse, I'm grippin' the wheel
I'm back between villages, and everything's still
[Bridge: Hazel Lewis, Melvin Coburn, Noah Kahan]
"When I, for me personally
I found a town big enough for anything that I want
I mean, I'm not a city girl, ha-ha-ha, by any means"
"Strafford, it still has a lot of meaning to me
Because I grew up there
Well, I guess it's a small— (Ah, ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
A small community of, uh, people that really look out for each other (Ah, ah, ah)
And that's the same way with anybody that needs anything
This— this community is there to help"
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ooh (Woah)
Ah-oh
[Outro]
The things that I lost here, the people I knew
They got me surrounded for a mile or two
Left at the graveyard, I'm driving past ghosts
Their arms are extended, my eyes start to close
The car's in reverse, I'm grippin' the wheel
I'm back between villages, and everything's still
