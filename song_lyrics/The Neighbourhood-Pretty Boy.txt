[Intro]
Ooh
No, no
Ooh
No, no
[Chorus]
Even if my heart stops beating
You're the only thing I need, ooh, with me
Even if the Earth starts shaking
You're the only thing worth taking, ooh, with me
Even if the sky's on fire
Got you here, it's alright, ooh, with me
And if it's all over
I'm taking this moment, ooh, with me
Yeah
[Verse]
Pretty boy, you did this with me, boy
Now it's all about to end
Baby girl, look where we made it, girl
Hmm, now we're falling
[Pre-Chorus]
As long as I got you
I'm gonna be alright
As long as I got you, yeah
I'm not afraid to die
I'm alright
