[Verse 1]
This what happen when I think 'bout you
I get in my feelings, yeah, I start reminiscing, yeah
Next time around, fuck, I want it to be different, yeah
Waiting on a sign, guess it's time for a different prayer
Lord, please save her for me
Do this one favor for me
I had to change my player ways
Got way too complicated for me
I hope she's waiting for me
Everywhere she go they playin' my song
That's why I say the things that I say
That way I know you can't ignore me
But so, so (Yeah)
[Chorus]
So give me all of you in exchange for me
Just give me all of you in exchange for me, for me
[Interlude]
Break it down, yeah
Yessir
Check
[Verse 2]
We used to lay up and then stay up, have sex and then blow dank
I shouldn't have played no games with you, just leveled-up my rank
Last time I saw you we ain't speak, that was strange
Guess it's nothing I can do, man, it's true, exes change, yeah
Ayy, guess you changed for the better (Better!)
I know you know how to make me jealous
I was never loyal, let you tell it, yo
But I'm ready to fix it if you ready, baby
But so-so (Yeah)
