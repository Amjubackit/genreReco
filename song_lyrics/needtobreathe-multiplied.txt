[Verse]
Your love is like radiant diamonds
Bursting inside us, we cannot contain
Your love will surely come find us
Like blazing wild fires singing Your name
[Chorus]
God of mercy, sweet Love of mine
I have surrendered to Your design
May this offering stretch across the skies
And these hallelujahs be multiplied
[Verse]
Your love is like radiant diamonds
Bursting inside us, we cannot contain
Your love will surely come find us
Like blazing wild fires singing Your name
[Chorus]
God of mercy, sweet Love of mine
I have surrendered to Your design
And may this offering stretch across the skies
And these hallelujahs be multiplied
[Post-Chorus]
Multiplied (Multiplied, multiplied)
Oh, multiplied
[Chorus]
God of mercy, sweet Love of mine
I have surrendered to Your design
May this offering stretch across the skies
And these hallelujahs be multiplied
These hallelujahs be multiplied
[Outro]
Your love is like radiant diamonds
Bursting inside us, we cannot contain
Your love will surely come find us
Like blazing wild fires singing Your name
