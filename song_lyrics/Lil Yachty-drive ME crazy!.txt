[Intro: Diana Gordon]
Ooh
[Verse 1: Diana Gordon]
Imagine life, imagine life without me, it's a crazy time
You want the kind of love that can make a child
Don't want just anybody
(Not just anybody, not just anybody) Ooh
Good love fill my body up like a glass
When you pour it all out
If you know me, you know I mind
Someone like me is hard to find
No mistakinâ€™ if I am there
Well aware you are always mine
And still you seem so surprised
Always gon' be mine
[Chorus: Diana Gordon with 
Lil Yachty
]
I wanna be where you are
I just can't walk away
You drive me crazy, ah
I lose it, lose it
And I wanna be where you are
I just can't walk away
You drive me crazy, ah
I lose it, lose it
