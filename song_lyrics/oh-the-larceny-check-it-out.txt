I’m in a sweet spot
I’m feeling good
The sun is shining
I knew it would
The world’s a playground
I’m in the clouds
Let me show you what it's all about (Check it out)

I’m gonna light it up, yeah I’m gonna light it up (Check it out)
I’m gonna light it up, yeah I’m gonna light it up (Just check it out)
I’m gonna light it up, yeah I’m gonna light it up
Let me show you what it's all about (Check it out)
[Verse 2]
I’m on the big stage
I got my crew
I’ll get you moving
It’s what I do
The party’s starting
It’s going down
Let me show you what it's all about (Check it out)
[Chorus]
I’m gonna light it up, yeah I’m gonna light it up (Check it out)
