[Verse 1]
I could see me sittin' in the back of a cop car bangin' my head on a window
I could see me slammin' that last call shot glass, losin' everything in my billfold
Ooh, ooh
That's what I do when I'm drinkin' 'bout you
[Chorus]
So, I don't wanna go downtown doin' what we used to
Twist the top off another round, hell I got enough loose screws
I’m gettin' tired of hurtin' 'bout you
Nothin' ever changes
I think I'm gonna stay right here tonight
'Cause that could be dangerous
'Cause that could be dangerous
[Verse 2]
Yeah, I could see me doin' just fine with a Daisy Duke dime but I don't see it lastin' long
I could see me orderin' too many drinks at the bar
Get the bartender pourin' 'em strong
That's what I do when I'm tryna drink you gone
[Chorus]
So, I don't wanna go downtown doin' what we used to
Twist the top off another round, hell I got enough loose screws
I’m gettin' tired of hurting 'bout you
Nothin' ever changes
I think I'm gonna stay right here tonight
'Cause that could be dangerous
'Cause that could be dangerous
