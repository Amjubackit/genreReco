[Intro]
I know that it seems sometimes, that no matter what you do
Or no matter how hard you work, striving to make things better in your life, but
For some reason, you're not getting nowhere
Well, I want you to turn to the one next to you
And tell him
[Verse 1: Marvin Sapp]
You tried your way
It didn't work, no
You put Him second (Second, yeah!)
And put you first (Oh, yeah!)
You trusted friends (Mhh)
Thought they had your back (Oo-ooo)
And every time you turn around
It seems you're under attack, yeah, yeah, yeah
But turn to your neighbor and say
(Neighbor)
[Chorus: Marvin Sapp]
See the devil is a liar (Neighbor)
No, I'm not gon' die (Neighbor)
It's okay to cry (Neighbor)
â€˜Cause He's by your side (Neighbor)
You gotta stop that hatin' (Neighbor)
I know you don't wanna hear it (Neighbor)
Gotta fast and pray and listen (Neighbor) to the Spirit
(God's tryna tell me something)
He's speaking to your heart right now
(God's tryna tell me something)
Just listen to the Spirit, ohh
(God's tryna tell me something)
Hold up, (Shh)
(Listen)
