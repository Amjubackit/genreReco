[Verse 1]
My heart a storm
Clouds raging deep within
The Prince of Peace came bursting through the wind
The violent sky held its breath
And in Your light I found rest
[Bridge]
Tearing through the night
Riding on the storm
Staring down the fight
My eyes found Yours
Shining like the sun
Striding through my fear
The Prince of Peace met me there
You heard my prayer
[Verse 2]
Hope like the sun
Light piercing through the dark
The Prince of Peace came and broke into my heart
The violent cross, the empty grave
And in Your light I found grace
[Bridge]
Tearing through the night
Riding on the storm
Staring down the fight
My eyes found Yours
Shining like the sun
Striding through my fear
The Prince of Peace met me there
You were always there
And you heard my prayer[Refrain]
Your love surrounds me
When my thoughts wage war
When night screams terror
There your voice will roar
Come death or shadow
God I know Your light will meet me there
When fear comes knocking
There You'll be my Guard
When day breeds trouble
There You'll hold my heart
Come storm or battle
God I know Your peace will meet me there
[Hook]
Oh, be still my heart
I Know that You are God
I'll fear no evil
For I know You are here
I know You're here
Know You're here
[Hook]
Oh, be still my heart
I know that You are God
Oh, be still my heart
I know that You are God
And be still
And be still
Oh, be still my heart
I know that You are God
And my soul will know...[Refrain]
Your love surrounds me
When my thoughts wage war
When night screams terror
There your voice will roar
Come death or shadow
God I know Your light will meet me there
And my soul will know
When fear comes knocking
There You'll be my Guard
When day breeds trouble
There You'll hold my heart
Come storm or battle
God I know Your peace will meet me there
[Outro]
Oh, be still my heart
I know that You are God
And You heard my prayer
