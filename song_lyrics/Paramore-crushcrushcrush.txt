[Verse 1]
I got a lot to say to you
Yeah, I got a lot to say
I noticed your eyes are always glued to me
Keeping them here and it makes no sense at all
[Pre-Chorus 1]
They taped over your mouth
Scribbled out the truth with their lies
Your little spies
They taped over your mouth
Scribbled out the truth with their lies
Your little spies
[Pre-Chorus 2: Hayley Williams & 
Josh Farro
]
Crush, crush, crush, crush, crush
(
Two, three, four
)
[Chorus]
Nothing compares to
A quiet evening alone
Just the one two of us who's counting on
That never happens
I guess I'm dreaming again
Let's be more than
This
