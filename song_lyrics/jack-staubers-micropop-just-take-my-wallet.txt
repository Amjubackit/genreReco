[Verse 1]
Your mama's crying (Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo)
Your mama's crying for you (Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo)
Mama's lying (La-la-la-la-la-la)
Oh, what's she trying to do (Ma-da-ba-da-da)
To you?
[Verse 2]
Good times are singing
They sang, they sang
Those times are echoing through me (Ba-ba-ba-ba)
Through me
[Outro]
What's the softest way to say
You took away my friend, my buddy?
What's the kindest way to say
You took away my friend?
What's the kindest way to say
You took away my friend, my buddy?
What's the kindest way to say
The end?
