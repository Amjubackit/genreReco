[Intro]
A-hey, do it now, huh
Yeah, hey
[Verse 1]
Hey-ah, once I was a boogie singer
Playing in a rock and roll band
I never had no problems, yeah
Burning down the one-night stands
Then everything around me, yeah
It got to start to feeling so low
And I decided quickly, yes, I did, heh
To disco down and check out the show
[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, they were dancing and singing
And moving to the grooving
And just when it hit me
Somebody turned around and shouted
[Chorus]
"Play that funky music, white boy
Play that funky music right
Play that funky music, white boy
Lay down the boogie and play that funky music 'til you die", heh heh
'Til you die, yeah (What?)
Hear, hear, heh
