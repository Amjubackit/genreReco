[Chorus: Submotion Orchestra]
Could it be you calling me down, down, down, down, down?
My foolish heart turns at the stars
All that I am is all that you see
You don't need nobody else, and you're putting this all on me, forgive me
[Verse 1]
There's a time and a place for all this
This is not the place for all this
Is there a reason why you're saying all this?
And can we talk 'bout it later?
I've gotta right my wrongs
With you is where I belong
You've been down from the go, recognition is what you want
And it's something that I should know
[Pre-Chorus]
Something that I should know, uh
All the things that you went through, girl, I never meant to put you through it twice, no
But tell me, how can I right my wrongs? That's something that I should know
All the things that we been through, girl, I never meant to put you through it twice, no, no
[Chorus: Submotion Orchestra]
Could it be you calling me down, down, down, down, down?
My foolish heart turns at the stars
All that I am is all that you see
You don't need nobody else, and you're putting this all on me, forgive me
