[Instrumental]
[Verse]
Jesus, what a Savior
What a brother, what a friend
Lifter of the lowly
God You meet me where I am
Jesus, what a Savior
What a brother, what a friend
Lifter of the lowly
God You meet me where I am
[Pre-Chorus]
Your heart, it knows no borders
Knows no walls
You're constantly moving
Towards me
With open arms
[Chorus]
I've never known a love like Yours
I've never known a love like Yours, no
I've never known a love like Yours
I've never known a love like Yours
[Verse]
Jesus, what a Savior
What a brother, what a friend
Lifter of the lowly
God You meet me where I am
[Pre-Chorus]
Your heart, it knows no borders
Knows no walls
You're constantly moving
Towards me
With open arms
[Chorus]
I've never known a love like Yours
I've never known a love like Yours, no
I've never known a love like Yours
I've never known a love like Yours, oh
[Pre-Chorus]
Your heart, it knows no borders
Knows no walls
You're constantly moving
Towards me
With open arms
[Chorus]
I've never known a love like Yours (no)
I've never known a love like Yours, no
I've never known a love like Yours (no)
I've never known a love like Yours, no
[Bridge]
Hallelujah, hallelujah
What a beautiful way You show this
Hallelujah, hallelujah
What a wonderful Savior
Hallelujah, hallelujah
What a beautiful way You show this
Hallelujah, hallelujah
What a wonderful Savior
[Chorus]
I've never known a love like Yours
I've never known a love like Yours
I've never known a love like Yours
I've never known a love like Yours
[Outro]
Jesus, what a Savior
What a brother, what a friend
Lifter of the lowly
God You meet me where I am
Jesus, what a Savior
What a brother, what a friend
You're the lifter of the lowly
God You meet me where I am
