[Verse 1]
Run run, ditto moon
Pullin' back, shape up to
The know
High stream, pushing steam
Rolling eye is forced to dream, you go
All I want to know is how to start over again
You want it?
All I need to know is how to gain control
Of the shapeless soul
[Chorus]
Oh, you sit amongst yourselves
Soon, you lie under ecstasy
Your eye has stolen me
Oh, you sit amongst yourselves
Soon, you lie under ecstasy
Your eye is switchin' with it
[Post-Chorus]
Close the heavy lid tightly
And turn away from your energy conversion box
[Verse 2]
Run run, ditto moon
Pullin' back, shape up to
The know
High stream, pushing steam
Rolling eye is forced to dream, you go
All I want to know is how to start over again
You want it?
All I need to know is when you start to control
Of the shapeless soul
[Chorus]
Oh, you're sittin' beside of me
Soon, you lie under ecstasy
Gimp eye is switched away
Oh, your sittin' amongst yourselves
Soon, you lie under ecstasy
Your eye is source it means
Ever wish you go in?
Ever wish you go in?
I will see you sitting here
Ever wish you sold it out?
Ever wish you sold it out?
In the silence
In the silence
[Chorus]
Oh, you sittin' amongst yourselves
Soon, you lie under ecstasy
Sunken eye of mysteries
Oh, you sit amongst yourselves
Soon, you lie under ecstasy
Swishin' our mysteries
I await, no rise
Our worlds olden style is stale
Oh, no
I'll know
Let's sail go go
You, I don't need ascension
