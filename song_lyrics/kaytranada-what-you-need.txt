[Intro]
Hoo, hoo
Oh, oh
[Verse 1]
I never wanted you to see this part of me
I wish you woulda told the truth
Oh, than make us settle
[Pre-Chorus]
Doin' something wrong
Always a mile apart
Oh and I cannot argue too, all of a sudden
Be in my arms
Slowin’ my beatin’ heart
‘Cause even when it’s wrong you’ll see
[Chorus]
That it’s what you need
What you need
[Instrumental Interlude]
[Verse 2]
I don’t know where I went wrong, no, baby
(So wrong, so wrong)
I know that you’ll be the one that got away
If you don’t stay, no, mm[Pre-Chorus]
I never wanted you
To see this part of me
Now all I can hope to do
Is tell you still
[Chorus]
That it’s what you need
What you need
[Outro]
Hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo
Hoo
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
