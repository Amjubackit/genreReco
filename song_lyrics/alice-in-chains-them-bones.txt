[Intro]
Ah! Ah!
Ah! Ah!
[Verse 1]
I believe
Them bones are me
Some say
We're born into the grave
[Chorus]
I feel so alone
Gonna end up a big ol' pile of them bones
[Post-Chorus]
Ah!
Ah! Ah!
[Verse 2]
Dust rise
Right on over my time
Empty
Fossil of the new scene
[Chorus]
I feel so alone
Gonna end up a big ol' pile of them bones
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
Toll due
Bad dream come true
I lie
Dead gone under red sky
[Chorus]
I feel so alone
Gonna end up a big ol' pile of them
I feel so alone
Gonna end up a big ol' pile of them
I feel so alone
Gonna end up a big ol' pile of them bones
