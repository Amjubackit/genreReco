[Verse 1]
Mountain of worry
Mountain of song
You ask how I'm doing
Like you knew what was wrong
Tell me just one time
What I knew all along
[Chorus]
I'm on your side
On your side
Long blue light
[Verse 2]
If you don't call me
I might lose my mind
Can't keep concentrating
On all the worry I find
So just lend me your body
I'll lend you mine
[Chorus]
I'm on your side
On your side
Long blue light[Verse 3]
My eyelids are heavy
My spirit is numb
Don't know where I'm headed
Don't know where I'm from
I'm here just waiting
For my day to come
[Chorus]
I'm on your side
On your side
Long blue light
I'm on your side
On your side
Long blue light
I'm on your side
On your side
Long blue light
I'm on your side
On your side
Long blue light
I'm on your side
On your side
Long blue light
