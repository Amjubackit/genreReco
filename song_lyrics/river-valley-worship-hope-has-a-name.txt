[Verse 1]
There is a song, I know it well
A melody that's never failed
On mountains high, in valleys low
My soul will rest, my confidence, in You alone
[Chorus]
Hope has a name, His name is Jesus
My Savior's cross has set this sinner free
Hope has a name, His name is Jesus
Oh, Christ be praised, I have victory
[Verse 2]
There is a light, salvation's flame
Christ undefeated, trampled the grave
See now the cross, be lifted high
The light has come, the light has won, behold the Christ
[Chorus]
Hope has a name, His name is Jesus
My Savior's cross has set this sinner free
Hope has a name, His name is Jesus
Oh, Christ be praised, I have victory
Hope has a name, His name is Jesus
My Savior's cross has set this sinner free
Hope has a name, His name is Jesus
Oh, Christ be praised, I have victory
[Verse 3]
There'll be a day my hope complete
Now home in glory, Your face I'll see
My pain no more, my fear will cease
I bow my life, I fix my eyes, on Christ my King
I bow my life, I fix my eyes, on Christ my King
[Chorus]
Hope has a name, His name is Jesus
My Savior's cross has set this sinner free
Hope has a name, His name is Jesus
Oh, Christ be praised, I have victory
Hope has a name, His name is Jesus
My Savior's cross has set this sinner free
Hope has a name, His name is Jesus
Oh, Christ be praised, I have victory
Oh, Christ be praised, I have victory
