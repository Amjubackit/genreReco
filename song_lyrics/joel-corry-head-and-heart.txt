[Intro]
Bam-bam-ba-dum-bam-ba, dum-bam-ba-dum
Bam-bam-ba-dum-bam-ba, dum-bam-ba-da-dum
[Verse 1]
Oh my God, oh my God, this feeling's just begun
Saying things I've never said, doing things I've never done (Ha)
Oh my God, oh my God, when I see you I should run
But I'm frozen in motion and my head tells me to stop
Tells me to stop
[Pre-Chorus]
Feeling feelings I feel about us (Hmm)
Try to fight it, but it's never enough
My heart is certain it's more than a crush
'Cause I'm frozen in motion and my head tells me to stop
[Chorus]
But my heart goes
Bam-bam-ba-dum-bam-ba, dum-bam-ba-dum
Bam-bam-ba-dum-bam-ba, dum-bam-ba-da-dum
'Cause my heart goes
Bam-bam-ba-dum-bam-ba, dum-bam-ba-dum
Bam-bam-ba-dum-bam-ba, dum-bam-ba-da-dum
[Verse 2]
Oh, oh my God, oh my God, can't believe what I've become (Ha)
I'm thinking things I shouldn't think, singing songs I've never sung
Oh, oh my God, oh my God, when I see you I should run
But I'm frozen in motion and my head tells me to stop
Tells me to stop
[Pre-Chorus]
Feeling feelings I feel about us (Hmm)
Try to fight it, but it's never enough ('Cause my heart)
My heart is certain it's more than a crush
'Cause I'm frozen in motion and my head tells me to stop
[Chorus]
But my heart goes
Bam-bam-ba-dum-bam-ba, dum-bam-ba-dum
Bam-bam-ba-dum-bam-ba, dum-bam-ba-da-dum
'Cause my heart goes
Bam-bam-ba-dum-bam-ba, dum-bam-ba-dum (Mmm)
Bam-bam-ba-dum-bam-ba, dum-bam-ba-da-dum
But my heart goes
Bam-bam-ba-dum-bam-ba, dum-bam-ba-dum (Yeah)
Bam-bam-ba-dum-bam-ba, dum-bam-ba-da-dum
'Cause my heart goes
Bam-bam-ba-dum-bam-ba, dum-bam-ba-dum (Ta-da-ra, da)
Bam-bam-ba-dum-bam-ba, dum-bam-ba-da-dum
[Bridge]
My head and my heart (Head and heart)
My head and my heart (Head and heart)
I can't tell 'em apart (My mind)
My head tells me to run (Run, run, run), but I can't
[Chorus]
'Cause my heart goes
Ba-ba-ba-dum-ba-ba, dum-ba-ba-dum (Oh)
Ba-ba-ba-dum-ba-ba, dum-ba-ba-da-dum
'Cause my heart goes
Ba-ba-ba-dum-ba-ba, dum-ba-ba-dum (My head and heart)
Ba-ba-ba-dum-ba-ba, dum-ba-ba-da-dum (Oh)
[Outro]
Oh my God, oh my God, this feeling's just begun
Saying things I've never said, doing things I've never done
Oh my God, oh my God, when I see you I should run (Yeah)
But I'm frozen in motion and my head tells me to stop
But my heart goes
