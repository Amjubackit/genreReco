[Verse]
We never made a plan if everything came down on us
And now we're just sleepwalking, dreamin' of what we've lost
Am I just blacked out or has the world turned to ashes
I'll let 'em rain down as we both move past this
[Chorus]
So let the tears flow down my face
Is this how we go down?
Is this how we go out?
So put my heart back in its place
This is how we go down
This is how we go down
So let the tears flow down my face
This is how we go down
This is where our fire goes out
[Drop]
This is where our fire goеs out (Woah, woah)
(Woah, woah-woah, oh woah)
[Build]
This is how our fire goes out
[Drop]
This is how our fire goеs out
[Chorus]
So let the tears flow down my face
Is this how we go down?
Is this how we go out?
So put my heart back in its place
This is how we go down
This is how we go down
So let the tears flow down my face
This is how we go down
This is where our fire goes out
[Drop]
This is where our fire goes out
[Outro]
Woah, woah
Woah, woah-woah, oh woah
