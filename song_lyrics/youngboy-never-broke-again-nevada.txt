[Intro]
(
Pipe that shit up, TnT
)
(
That's Vade on the keys
)
Niggas dyin', fallin' stars through the night
And I been thinkin' 'bout you every night
If you happy, I know that I should be alright
'Cause this tragic and I can't seem for to decide
[Chorus]
And I think I just, I should leave, I just
Should I leave it 'lone? I
Should I try or just? I can't lie, I just
I be wantin' for to cry
But I'm caught up with these hoes, they gon' follow
Ballin' like a baller blocker
Every time I catch my feelings, lock 'em in a bottle
And you probably find my heart somewhere lost in Nevada (In Nevada)
[Verse]
Don't know who I want, you the one I want, oh
Never said I don't, that's that money talk, oh (Talk)
Drunker than a skunk, it go down in the room (Down)
Choppеrs in the trunk, baby, this that slime tune
But I need your lovе like right now, baby, ooh (Ooh)
I'm not on no drugs, not right now, it's the truth (Truth)
I apologize for you lookin' like a fool (Sorry)
I can't hold you right now, so I been holdin' on my tool
I don't want my ex, I don't want no bitch I had (Don't)
I just want a chance, hopefully I make you glad (Don’t)
If you turn me down, tell the truth, I just might spazz (Spazz)
If who around laugh, I just probably bust they ass (Bust they ass)[Chorus]
And I think I just, I should leave, I just
Should I leave it 'lone? I
Should I try or just? I can't lie, I just
I be wantin' for to cry
But I'm caught up with these hoes, they gon' follow
Ballin' like a baller blocker
Every time I catch my feelings, lock 'em in a bottle
And you probably find my heart somewhere lost in 
Nevada (In Nevada)
