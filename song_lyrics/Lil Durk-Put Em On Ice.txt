[Verse 1]
Chanel or Cha-ne'-ne', whatever you call it
Whenever you poppin', don't matter who bought it
Prada wristband with the chip, my new wallet
Fresh out the creek, I'm discreet, I'm too solid
Charge up the G-Wagen, new electronic
Deep in religion, might get back demonic
Go ask promoters, I picked up six hundred
Four hundred more, one million, get it, he saw it
Six-carat stones, GIA, I went flawless
I had to flush with the top off the toilet
Fendi Baguette bag thirty-two hundred
Dealin' with jet lag, pass me a water
Sheets in the county, go run up a quarter
Brodie did that just to bonus his lawyer
She sent me the heart eyes, I tried to ignore her
Left her on read, let her know she a choice
[Chorus]
Put 'em on ice, he play
Put her on ice, she play
Put on my ice, I'm safe
My lil' brother, he carry a Drac'
And I told him ain't nobody safe
And I told him ain't nobody safe
And I told him ain't nobody safe
And I told him ain't nobody safe
