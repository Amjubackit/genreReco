Lord, this is a song to give you thanks
Help me express myself Lisa
Verse 1-
For every time that you protected me
When I didn't know your name
(Lord I say thank you)
How you loved on me and cared for me
When I didn't return the same, I
(Lord I say thank you)
Verse 2-
Now when It seemed like I was losing and I felt like giving up
I (Lord I) "I wanna say" (say thank you)
Your love rushed in like a mighty flood and lifted me above, and I (Lord I)
"I wanna say" (say thank you)
Chorus
I'll be thanking you and praising You for the rest of my life
For I've come to know the power of your love and sacrifice
(Thank you for your sacrifice)
I appreciate all that you do
(Everything You do, and I want to say)
Just want to say thank you
Verse 3-
Well, how you kept your hand upon me though I've Often gone astray
Yeah I... (Lord I say thank you)
And how your spirit gently led me back to safety in your way
I wanna say Lord I say thank You
(And I'll be thanking you)
