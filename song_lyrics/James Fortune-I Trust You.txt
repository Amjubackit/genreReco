(FIYA)
Even though I can’t see
And i can’t feel your touch
I will trust you lord
How I love you so much
Though my nights may seem long
And I feel so alone
Lord my trust is in you
I surrender to you
So many painful thoughts
Travel through my mind
And I wonder how
I will make it through this time
(FIYA)
But i trust you
Lord it’s not easy
Sometimes the pain in my life
Makes you seem far away
But i’ll trust you
I need to know you’re here
Through the tears and the pain
Through the heartache and rain
I’ll trust you
