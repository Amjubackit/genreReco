[Intro]
Hey
Hey
Ohh, ohh, ohhh
Fell in love
[Verse 1]
So, presently I'm standing
Here right now, you're so demanding
Tell me what you want from me
Concluding, concentrating on my music, lover, and my babies
Make me wanna ask a lady for a ticket outta town
[Hook]
So can I get a window seat?
Don't want nobody next to me
I just want a ticket outta town
A look around and a safe touch down
Can I get a window seat? (Oh, oh)
Don't want nobody next to me
I just want a chance to fly
A chance to cry, and a long bye-bye
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
[Post Hook 1]
But I, I need you to want me
I need you to miss me
I, I need yo' attention, yes
I need you next to me
Oh I, I need someone to clap for me (Mm-hmm)
I need your direction
