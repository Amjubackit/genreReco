[Verse 1]
You belong among the wildflowers
You belong in a boat out at sea
Sail away, kill off the hours
You belong somewhere you feel free
[Verse 2]
Run away, find you a lover
Go away somewhere all bright and new
And I have seen no other
Who compares with you
[Verse 3]
You belong among the wildflowers
You belong in a boat out at sea
You belong with your love on your arm
You belong somewhere you feel free
[Verse 4]
Run away, go find a lover
Run away, let your heart be your guide
You deserve the deepest of cover
You belong in that home by-and-by
[Verse 5]
You belong among the wildflowers
You belong somewhere close to me
Far away from your trouble and worries
You belong somewhere you feel free
You belong somewhere you feel free
