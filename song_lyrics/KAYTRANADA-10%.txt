[Refrain]
You keep on takin' from me
But where's my ten percent?
You keep on takin' from me
I wonder where you went
You keep on takin' from me
But where's my ten percent?
You keep on takin' from me
[Chorus]
Why you tryna lie for them?
Pretending who you are
But baby, why even pretend?
You're trying way too hard
Ego is not your friend
I only speak the truth
No, I'm not trying to offend
But why you tryna lie for them?
[Verse]
I wake up, it's so good to be me
In the mirror, it's good to see me
I don't check for these other bitches
You can ask God 'cause that's my witness
You just don't have a clue who to be
Look in your eyes, I see the envy
I don't check for these other bitches
You can ask God 'cause that's my witness
