[Chorus]
Lately, all I wanna do
Is lie around with you
And complain about the youth
How we’ll never leave your room
Tell me everything that bothers you
[Verse 1]
Aimlessly driving on the highway
Hoping that you’ll check your phone
And that you’re still awake
Please don’t take this as anything
But honest, I am
I’m still stuck on last Thursday
When you undressed and whispered my name
[Chorus]
Lately, all I wanna do
Is lie around with you
And complain about the youth
How we’ll never leave your room
Tell me everything that bothers you
And damn girl, you don’t even know
Looking at my eyes, staring at my soul
I forgot how to be alone
Stay up all night when you’re not at home[Verse 2]
Waffle House, black coffee in our mugs
We’re hazy-eyed, but not because we’re fucked up
It’s just that we’ve been up all night
Sharing stories of our past
Empty vows of how you’d keep in touch
If I can always make you laugh
And all I wanna do
Is just lie around with you
[Chorus]
Lately, all I wanna do
Is lie around with you
And complain about the youth
How we’ll never leave your room
Tell me everything that bothers you
And damn girl, you don’t even know
Looking in my eyes, staring at my soul
I forgot how to be alone
Stay up all night when you’re not at home
[Bridge]
And my chest ignites when I hear you speak
Miss your company long before you leave
Your scent, it lingers all within my sheets
And your touch, girl, brings me to my knees[Chorus]
Lately, all I wanna do
Is lie around with you
And complain about the youth
How we’ll never leave your room
Tell me everything that bothers you
And damn girl, you don’t even know
Looking at my eyes, staring at my soul
I forgot how to be alone
Stay up at night when you’re not at home
