[Verse 1]
(Hey) Once upon a younger year
When all our shadows disappeared
The animals inside came out to play
(Hey) Hey, went face to face with all our fears
Learned our lessons through the tears
Made memories we knew would never fade
[Pre-Chorus]
One day my father he told me
"Son, don't let it slip away"
He took me in his arms, I heard him say (Hey)
"When you get older
Your wild heart will live for younger days
Think of me if ever you're afraid"
[Chorus]
He said, "One day you'll leave this world behind
So live a life you will remember"
My father told me when I was just a child
"These are the nights that never die"
My father told me
[Pre-Drop]
(Hey, hey)
(Hey, hey)
(Hey, hey)
