[Intro: Adam Young & 
Carly Rae Jepsen
]
Hmm-mmm-mmm
Woah-oh-oh-oh
It's always a good time
Woah-oh-oh-oh
It's always a good time
[Verse 1: Adam Young & 
Carly Rae Jepsen
]
Woke up on the right side of the bed
What's up with this Prince song inside my head?
Hands up, if you're down to get down tonight (
Hmm-mmm-mmm
)
'Cause it's always a good time
Slept in all my clothes, like I didn't care
Hopped into a cab, take me anywhere
I'm in if you're down to get down tonight
'Cause it's always a good time
[Pre-Chorus: Adam Young & 
Carly Rae Jepsen
, 
Both
]
Good morning and goodnight
I wake up at twilight
It's gonna be alright
We don't even have to try, it's always a good time (
Woo!
)
[Chorus: Adam Young & 
Carly Rae Jepsen
, 
Both
]
Woah-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh
It's always a good time
Woah-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
We don't even have to try, it's always a good time
(Good time, good time, it's always a good time)
(Woah-oh-oh-oh)
