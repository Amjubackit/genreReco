[Verse 1]
I'm a bruise you soothe
In your dancing shoes
I'm a ticking time bomb hooligan
Come to light your fuse
Twenty-four karat
 thug (Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh)
In a velvet glove (Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
Pinin' for pretty potions (Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh)
Down those holes you dug
[Chorus]
Bouncing off of your walls
On the mountains at midnight
Crawling out of my bones
Till the break of the daylight
Another rosy ruse
Another shiver from my spine
Crawling out of my bones
Till the break of the daylight
[Verse 2]
I'm the hidden draw
Of what you were before
I splice and play back
Reels from the cutting-room floor
And nothing gets me close (Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh)
To how I wanna feel (Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
Try to suck it up (Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh)
But I still get no fear
