[Verse 1]
Well, I was rolling down the road in some cold blue steel
I had a blues man on the back and a beautician at the wheel
We going downtown in the middle of the night
We laughing and I'm joking and we feeling alright
[Chorus]
Oh, I'm bad, I'm nationwide
Yes I'm bad, I'm nationwide
[Verse 2]
Easing down the highway in a new Cadillac
I had a fine fox in front, I had three more in the back
They sporting short dresses, wearing spike-heel shoes
They smoking Lucky Strikes and wearing nylons too
[Chorus]
'Cause we bad, we're nationwide
Yeah, we bad, we're nationwide
[Instrumental Break 1:32-2:43]
[Verse 3]
Well, I was moving down the road in my V-8 Ford
I had a shine on my boots, I had my sideburns lowered
With my New York brim and my gold tooth displayed
Nobody give me trouble 'cause they know I got it made
[Chorus]
I'm bad, I'm nationwide
Well, I'm bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, I'm nationwide, yeah, yeah
[Instrumental Outro 3:20-4:52]
