The presence of the Lord is here
The presence of the Lord is here
I feel it in the atmosphere
The presence of the Lord is here
The presence of the Lord is here
The spirit of the Lord is here
The spirit of the Lord is here
I feel it in the atmosphere
The spirit of the Lord is here
The spirit of the Lord is here
The power of the Lord is here
The power of the Lord is here
I feel it in the atmosphere
The power of the Lord is here
The power of the Lord is here
Everybody blow the trumpet
And sound the alarm
Because the Lord is in the temple
Let everybody bow
Let all the people praise Him now
The Lord is here!
A blessing from the Lord is here
A blessing from the Lord is here
I feel it in the atmosphere
A blessing from the Lord is here
A blessing from the Lord is here
