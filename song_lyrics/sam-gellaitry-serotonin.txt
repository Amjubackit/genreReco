[Verse 1]
My favorite name has popped up again
Onto my screen
And it's so insane the way she fills my brain
With serotonin
It's been a long day, and all I need you to say
Is that you've missed me
And I'll say I feel the same, and that it's such a shame
We've both been busy
[Chorus]
There's so much on my mind
I'm sure it's gonna leave when we're together
And you don't have to try
You know you just alleviate all this pressure
There's so much on my mind
I'm sure it's gonna leave when we're together
And you don't have to try
You know you just alleviate all this pressure
[Verse 2]
Trying to keep composure
I hope that no one else in here can notice
But I have overdosed on serotonin
I swear I've never felt this good in my life
I can't wait to show you
And give you all of this love and emotion
That I've been holdin' on to for you for too long
And by the time that you arrive
I'll be tongue-tied
