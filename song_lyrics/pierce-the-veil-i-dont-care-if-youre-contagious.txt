[Verse 1: Vic Fuentes]
Bury me in the bedroom where I, I can sing you to sleep all night
Put me next to the open window, promise me a second time
Cause I don't wanna leave without you buried by my side
I'd rather kill the one responsible for falling stars at night
Cause they fall all around me
The night can be deadly
[Chorus: Vic Fuentes, and Vanessa Harris]
And they'll never take us alive
(Can you chase away the darkness?)
To live and love and die
Last night she recited every reason she's fine
So if we're heading there together at the same time
You sing while I drive
[Verse 2]
Move like a fugitive tonight
Dance on the ambulance
Cause I'd rather spend my life, vacations
In bed with you like drunken summer kites
And this is only a test
Sober and scaring me to death
[Chorus: Vic Fuentes, and Vanessa Harris]
They'll never take us alive
(Can you chase away the darkness)
To live in love and die
[Bridge]
And I don't care if you're sick
I don't care if you're contagious
I would kiss you even if you were dead
Would somebody make me go blind for the rest of my life
Cause I'd do anything to hold your hand
And I don't care if you're sick
I don't care if you're contagious, oh no
Would somebody make me go blind for the rest of my life
Cause I'd do anything, anything, anything
[Chorus: Vic Fuentes]
They'll never take us alive
Cause I'll chase away the darkness
I'll live, and love, and die
I join the party for the recently blind
So if we're heading there together you can sing all night
[Outro: Vic Fuentes]
I'm gonna tear out the thread one by one from your skin
Till your bones feel embarrassed from all the attention
Kiss me while I drive
