Something on the inside
Coming on strong
Everything wasn't right
Now I can do no wrong
All I was afraid of
Bringing me down
All the walls around love
Falling to the ground
Joy, rolling like the thunder rumbles
Time to let the teardrops tumble
Listen to the hatred crumble
Now that I have joy, flying on the wings of angels
Rattling the chains untangled
I see me from a different angle
Now I have joy
Every single minute
And every hour
I'm drowning in it
And I can feel the power
And I keep on pushing
Through the good and the bad
And I believе
Because I have
Joy, rolling likе the thunder rumbles
Time to let the teardrops tumble
Listen to the hatred crumble
Now that I have joy, flying on the wings of angels
Rattling the chains untangled
I see me from a different angle
Now I have joy
Joy, rolling like the thunder rumbles
Time to let the teardrops tumble
Listen to the hatred crumble
Now that I have joy, flying on the wings of angels
Rattling the chains untangled
I see me from a different angle
Now I have joy
(Joy)
(Joy) Joy
(Joy) Joy
(Joy)
(Joy) Joy
(Joy) Joy
