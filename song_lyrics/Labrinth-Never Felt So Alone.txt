[Intro: Labrinth]
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
[Chorus: Labrinth, 
Labrinth & Billie Eilish
]
And I never felt so alone, felt so alone, na-na
And I never felt so alone, felt so alone, na-na
A
nd I
 never felt so alone, felt so alone, na-na
And I never felt so alone, felt so alone, na-na
[Verse 1: Labrinth, 
Labrinth & Billie Eilish
,

]
In a whip (Woah), thinkin', "What if (Woah)
You and this (Woah) never existed?"
Hollow 
kiss
 (Woah), 
bottle
 liquor (
Oh
)
Man, I'm 
sick
, man, I'm schizo
[Pre-Chorus: Labrinth, 
Labrinth & Billie Eilish
]
All white leather
You know this man ain't shit without you in the interior (I'm dyin' 
somewhere in the dark
)
All white leather
And I think, "What if we weren't 
ridin' and dyin' together?"
The whole world would fall apart
[Chorus: Labrinth & Billie Eilish, 
Billie Eilish
, 
Labrinth
]
And I never felt so alone, felt so alone, na-na (
Never felt so alone
, 
woo!
 
Alone
)
And I never felt so alone, felt so alone, na-na
