[Intro]
We got London on da Track
[Verse 1: Summer Walker]
I should've known better
Can't even pretend like I don't want it again
On the brain all the time
Thinkin' of all the things that we did
You did somethin' (Come through, quarter after two)
'Cause shit like this don't happen too often
It's the way you put it down (Come through, quarter after two)
I don't want no one else around
[Pre-Chorus: Summer Walker]
Got me takin' a step on the wild side
Cuttin' all ties
With them other guys
Way you, way you look in my eyes
Lovin' me nice and slow
[Chorus: Summer Walker]
You make me wanna come through
Quarter after two
Just to put it down on you
You make me wanna replay
All of the things
That you and me, we do
You make me wanna come through
Quarter after two
Just to put it down on you
You make me wanna replay
All of the things
That you and me, we do[Post-Chorus: Summer Walker]
Look at what you make me wanna do (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'll drop all my niggas for you (Woah, woah, woah)
Got my feelings runnin' on a loop (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
This ain't what I'm really used to (Woah, woah, woah)
[Verse 2: Usher]
(You make me wanna, wanna, wanna)
Before anything happens between us
Be sure you're ten toes down before I pull out this car (Pull it)
And the only thing that's comin' beside me
Out this situation is you waitin' to get some more (Oh, get it)
I told you, I'ma take you places (Whoa)
I seen it in your face (Yeah, yeah)
And I knew that you would say this
So how you wanna play this?
Yeah, you got somebody (Yeah)
I been in this predicament (Uh)
Don't trip, creep discrete
That's just what we dealin' with
[Chorus: Usher & 
Summer Walker,
 
Both

(You make me wanna, wanna, wanna)
You make me wanna come through
Quarter after two
Just to put it down on you
You make me wanna replay
 (Oh)
All of the things
 (Oh)
That you and me, we do
 (Woo)
(You make me wanna, wanna)
You make me wanna come through
Quarter after two
Just to put it down on you (No, don't you, babe)
You make me wanna replay
All of the things
