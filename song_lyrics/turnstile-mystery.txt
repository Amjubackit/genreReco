[Verse 1]
There's a gun to my head
Are you gonna get it right?
And I believe in holding on to life
But I'm afraid, too
[Chorus]
And it's been so long
Is all the mystery gone?
And it's been so long
All the mystery
All the mystery
[Verse 2]
There's a clock in my head
Is it wrong, is it right?
I know you're scared of running out of time
But I'm afraid, too
[Chorus]
And it's been so long
Is all the mystery gone?
And it's been so long
All the mystery
[Solo][Bridge]
Ohhh, ohhh
Ohhh, ohhh
Ohhh, ohhh
[Chorus]
And it's been so long
Is all the mystery gone?
And it's been so long
All the mystery
