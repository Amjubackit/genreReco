[Intro]
One day, she'll take the world from you
[Verse 1]
Running, baby, down the beach, yeah
They all tell me that I don't need you now
Running, baby, hold on
I'll be here for you
[Pre-Chorus]
Just hold me, I'm a lonely heart
You've been miles away
Just hold me 
and we'll never get hurt
You've been miles away
[Chorus]
Heavy, California
On the levee, 
can't afford ya
They say heaven's waiting for ya
So I'm heading for California
Oh, Lord!
California
[Verse 2]
Miss the sunlight, I was saying
Your love is amazing, so hold onto it for me
Come on, baby, hold on
I'll be here for you
