(Verse 1)
When I moved to California
I had a friend out there
My scarlet begonia
Hollywood affair
I got caught up in the big wave
Riding that big (guitar shout)
But my heart was being different
I knew it wasn't you
(Chorus)
Yeah you're on the path
and you tell yourself . . . you
just keep on moving
even if you hurt someone
Life don't last that long
(Verse 2)
Stayed high up in the mountain
But I couldn't feel my rest
I drank heavy from that fountain
Till I couldn't feel my chest
So many people
So much chatter
But nothing to fit my goals
Need lightness in my body
Colors to show my soul(Chorus 2)
Freeeeeee
Yeah you're on the path and you tell yourself
Neeeeeed
You just keep on moving find where you belong
Life don't last that long
(Verse 3)
Still looking for a wiseman
To reign this world
Maybe someday I will
Oh I will . . . find that pearl
Find that pearl
Mmm mmm mmm mmm
Find that pearl
I need something to believe in
Someone to hear my call
I tried to chose religion
I seemed to like them all
I keep reading my own scriptures
And gazing up above
Instead of being where I'm standing
And feeling that one love(Chorus 3)
Freeeeeee
Yeah you're on the path and you tell yourself you
Neeeeeed
You just keep on moving even when your faith is gone
Life don't last that long
Life don't last that long . . . Mmmmm
