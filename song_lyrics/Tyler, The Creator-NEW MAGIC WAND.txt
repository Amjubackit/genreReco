[Intro: Jerrod Carmichael]
Sometimes you gotta close a door to open a window
[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
I saw a photo, you looked joyous
My eyes are green, I eat my veggies
I need to get her out the picture
She's really fuckin' up my frame
She's not developed like we are
[Refrain: Tyler, The Creator]
Like magic, like magic, like magic, gone
New magic, new magic, new magic wand (Ayy)
Like magic, like magic, like magic, gone (Gone, nigga)
New magic (Woo), new magic, new magic wand
[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
My buddy said I'm on the spectrum
Don't call me selfish, I hate sharin'
This 60-40 isn't workin'
I want a hundred of your time, you're mine
[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator & 
Santigold & Jessy Wilson

Please don't leave me now
Please don't leave me now (
Don't leave
)
Please don't leave me now
Please don't leave me now (
Don't leave
)
Please don't leave me now (
Don't leave
)
(Like magic, like magic, like magic, gone)
Please don't leave me now (I can make her leave)
(New magic, new magic, new magic wand)
Please don't leave me now (
Don't leave
)
(Like magic, like magic, like magic, gone)
Please don't leave me now
(New magic, new magic, new magic wand)
