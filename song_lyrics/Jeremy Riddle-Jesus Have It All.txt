Jesus have my heart, my will, my soul
Jesus have my hopes, my dreams, my world
With joy I lay it down, with joy I cast my crowns
Jesus have it all
To You I bring my praise, my lips, my song
A living sacrifice as one reborn
Your life is now my own, Your will is what I want
Jesus have it all
Jesus have it all, Jesus have it all
To You belongs the glory, the praise of all the world
Jesus have it all, Jesus have it all
All blessing and all honor, all majesty and awe
Jesus have it all
Jesus have Your church, Your love, Your bride
The joy for which You freely gave Your life
Radiant in white, washеd and purified
Jesus have us all
Jеsus have Your worth, Your due, Your sum
The praise of every nation, tribe, and tongue
Let all that has been made glorify Your name
Jesus have it all
