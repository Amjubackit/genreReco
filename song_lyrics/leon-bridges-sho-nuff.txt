[Verse 1]
Standin' in the doorway
Silhouette on the wall
Connected to your body
Physical and spiritual
[Pre-Chorus]
And you know what I need
From my crown to my feet
Oh, please, baby, please
Before I fall to my knees
[Refrain]
Tell me how you like it
I just wanna try it
Tease me, but provide it
You got me excited
[Chorus]
But don't rush
That's that feeling I need more of
Sho nuff, babe
But don't rush
That's that feeling I need more of
Sho nuff, babe
[Verse 2]
Say my name, say my name
Let it roll off ya tongue
This is what it feels like
When two become one
[Pre-Chorus]
And I know what you need
From your crown to you feet
Oh, please, baby, please
I'm down on my knees
[Chorus]
But don't rush
That's that feeling I need more of (Sho nuff)
Sho nuff, babe
But don't rush
That's that feeling I need more of (Sho nuff)
Sho nuff, babе
[Post-Chorus]
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Sho nuff (Sho nuff), sho nuff, babe
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Sho nuff (Sho nuff), sho nuff, babe
[Refrain]
Tell mе how you like it
I just wanna try it
Teas me, but provide it
You got me excited
[Chorus]
But don't rush
That's that feeling I need more of
Sho nuff, babe
But don't rush
That's that feeling I need more of
Sho nuff, babe
[Post-Chorus]
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Sho nuff (Sho nuff), sho nuff, babe
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Sho nuff (Sho nuff), sho nuff, babe
[Outro]
Hangin' on to every minute and I don't ever want it to end
When it's over, start to miss it and then I just want you again
