[Verse 1]
In the landscape of my life
You don't rush through any season
You always take Your time
A careful hand, a gentle guide
You take what's dead away
And You prune what's runnin' wild
[Chorus]
So, be the gardener of my heart, tend the soil of my soul
Break up the fallow ground, cut back the overgrown
And I won't shy away, I will let the branches fall
So what You want can stay
And what You love can grow
[Verse 2]
Through the winter, I'm still alive
What You've planted in the dirt
Is ever reaching to the light
You prepare me for darkenеd times
You'll sustain what You have started
And You'll tеach me to abide
[Chorus]
So, be the gardener of my heart, tend the soil of my soul
Break up the fallow ground, cut back the overgrown
And I won't shy away, I will let the branches fall
So what You want can stay
And what You love can grow
Grow
What You love can grow
Watch it grow[Bridge]
And I'll remain in You, You remain in me
And I will trust Your timing
And I'll remain in You, You remain in me
From the start until the ending
Lord, I'll remain in You, You remain in me
And I will trust Your, oh, timing
I'll remain in You, You remain in me
From the start until the ending
'Cause You know better
[Chorus]
So, be the gardener of my heart, tend the soil of my soul
Break up the fallow ground, cut back the overgrown
And I won't shy away, I will let the branches fall
So, what You want can stay
And what You love can grow
Grow
What You love can grow
Grow
[Bridge]
I'll remain in You, You remain in me
And I will trust Your timing
I'll remain in You, You remain in me
From the start until the ending
Lord, I'll remain in You, You remain in me
And I will trust Your timing
I'll remain in You, You remain in me
From the start until the ending
Lord, I'll remain in You, You remain in me
And I will trust Your timing
I'll remain in You, You'll remain in me
From the start until the ending[Chorus]
So, be the gardener of my heart, tend the soil of my soul
Break up the fallow ground, cut back the overgrown
And I won't shy away, I will let the branches fall
So, what You want can stay
And what You love can grow
