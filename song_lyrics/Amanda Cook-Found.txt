[Verse 1]
I found what I've been looking for
Hidden in plain sight
I found what I've been searching for
It's been here the whole time
[Chorus]
It's You, it's You, it's You
Jesus, it's always been You
It's true, so true
Jesus, it's always been You
[Verse 2]
I overcomplicated it
Got stuck inside my mind
It took some time unraveling
But I'm seeing with new eyes
[Chorus]
It's You, it's You, it's You
Jesus, it's always been You
It's true, so true
Jesus, it's always been You
[Post-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh, ooh
Oh-oh-oh
It's always been You
Ooh-ooh, ooh
Oh-oh-oh
