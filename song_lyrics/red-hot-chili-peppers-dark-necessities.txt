[Verse 1]
Comin' on to the light of day, we got
Many moons that are deep at play so I
Keep an eye on the shadow smile to see what it has to say
You and I both know, everything must go away
Ah, what do you say?
Spinnin' knot that is on my heart is like a
Bit of light in a touch of dark, you got
Sneak attack from the zodiac
 but I see your fire spark
Eat the breeze and go, 
blow by blow and go away
Oh, what do you say? Yeah
[Chorus]
You don't know my mind, you don't know my kind
Dark necessities are part of my design and
Tell the world that I'm falling from the sky
Dark necessities are part of my design
[Verse 2]
Stumble down to the parking lot, you got
No time for the afterthought, they're like
Ice Cream for an Astronaut,
 
well, that's me looking for we
Turn the corner and find the world at your command
Playin' the hand, yeah
[Chorus]
You don't know my mind, you don't know my kind
Dark necessities are part of my design
Tell the world that I'm falling from the sky
Dark necessities are part of my design
