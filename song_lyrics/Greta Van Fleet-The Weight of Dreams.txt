[Instrumental]
[Verse 1]
All across the west we traveled wayward for
Find the weight of 
dreams in gold
Heaven sent us here to meet the hallowed shore
To claim the wealth that we had sold
[Chorus]
Gold mines melting men in the sunshine
Spoiled wine tastes so sweet, we have gone blind
Gold mines melting men in the sunshine
Spoiled wine tastes so sweet, we have gone blind
[Verse 2]
We stole from her a cloak of studded majesty
The queen is dead, we robbed her grave
You can still bathe in the river but it ran dry
And all of us have turned away
[Chorus]
Gold mines melting men in the sunshine
Spoiled wine tastes so sweet, we have gone blind
Gold mines melting men in the sunshine
Spoiled wine tastes so sweet, we have gone blind
