[Intro]
Urgh, obsolete
[Interlude]
Yeah!
[Verse 1]
For a thousand days, I watched the vultures circle overhead
And I counted the ways the world would
Be blessed when I finally reached my end
And I felt the weight of the world pushing me into the soil below
And I felt the desert sun above
While I tried to drink water from a stone
[Pre-Chorus]
But I'm not ready to die alone
[Chorus]
So can you wake me from my sleep
And show me now that this is just a dream?
'Cause I'm a whisper, once a scream
And I'm afraid of what's in store for me
Becoming obsolete
[Post-Chorus]
Become obsolete
Become obsolete, urgh![Verse 2]
Another frozen frame, another glitch inside my consciousness
So I pick my poison and just choke it down until I start to spin
And while the world just slowly turns, I fade like fog into the sea
While the mighty galleon burns around me, I slowly start to sink
[Breakdown]
Urgh, maybe I'm not ready to be set free
Maybe these shackles are what I need
If you find the answers, come rescue me
But I can't hold my breath
[Chorus]
So can you wake me from my sleep
And show me now that this is just a dream?
'Cause I'm a whisper, once a scream
And I'm afraid of what's in store for me
Becoming obsolete
[Interlude]
(Becoming obsolete)
Maybe I'm not ready to be set free
Maybe these shackles are what I need
If you find the answers, come rescue me
If you find the answers, come rescue me[Chorus]
So can you wake me from my sleep
And show me now that this is just a dream?
'Cause I'm a whisper, once a scream
And I'm afraid of what's in store for me
Becoming obsolete
[Post-Chorus]
Become obsolete
Become obsolete
Become obsolete
Become obsolete
Urgh!
