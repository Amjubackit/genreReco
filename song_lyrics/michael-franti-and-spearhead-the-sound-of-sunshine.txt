[Intro.]
One, two, three, uh-huh
[Verse 1]
I wake up in the morning at six o'clock
They say there may be rain but the sun is hot
I wish I had some time just to kill today
And I wish I had it down for every bill I've got to pay
Some days, you lose you win
And the water's as high as the times your in
So I jumped back into where I learned to swim
Tried to keep my head above it the best I can
That's why...
[Pre-Chorus]
Here I am
Just waiting for this storm to pass me by
[Chorus]
And that's the sound, of sunshine coming down!
And that's the sound, of sunshine coming down! (Down, down, down)
[Refrain]
Hey, hey, hey... hey, hey, hey hey, hey, hey, hey
One, two, three, uh-huh
[Verse 2]
I saw my friend Bobby, he said "What's up man?"
You got a little work or a twenty to lend?
I opened up my hand he said I'm glad to see
They can take away my job but not my friends you see
[Pre-Chorus]
And here I am
Just waiting for this storm to pass me by
(Pass me by)
[Chorus]
And that's the sound, of sunshine coming down!
And that's the sound, of sunshine coming down!
[Verse 3]
Yo, yo, here we go
I wanna go where the summer never ends
With the guitar on the beach there with all my friends
The sun's so hot and the waves in motion
And everything smells like sun-tan lotion
The ocean, and the girls so sweet
So kick off your shoes and relax your feet
They say that miracles are never ceasin'
And every single song needs a little releasin'
The stereo bumpin' till the sun goes down
And I only wanna hear that sound!
[Chorus]
And that's the sound, of sunshine coming down!
And that's the sound, of sunshine coming down! (down, down, down)
[Bridge]
And I say
You're the one I wanna be with (yo, yo), when the sun goes down
You're the one I wanna be with (the one I wanna be with), when the sun goes down
Singing, you're the one I wanna be with, when the sun goes down
You're the one I wanna be with, when the sun goes
[Chorus]
And that's the sound, of sunshine coming down!
And that's the sound, of sunshine coming down!
[Outro]
Hey, hey, hey (when the sun goes down)
Hey hey hey (when the sun goes down) hey hey hey hey
When the sun goes down!
