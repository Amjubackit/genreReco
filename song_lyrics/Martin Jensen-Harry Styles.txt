[Intro]
When I drink rosé wine
Oh I hear Harry Styles
If I wake up at three
I think of you and me
[Verse 1]
I always think about my family
When I'm counting down at New Year's Eve
I get taken back to my first real girlfriend
When I smell that perfume in the street
[Pre-Chorus]
Pieces of my past all come together
Fly right through my head
Something 'bout our love
Could not last forever
How can I forget?
[Chorus]
When I drink rosé wine
Oh I hear Harry Styles
If I wake up at three
I think of you and me
When I see season one to five
Of New York Real Housеwives
No matter wherе I'm gonna be
I think of you and me
