[Intro: Smokey Robinson and The Miracles]
Since I saw you last, there's been many a sunset
And every day we're apart seems like a week
Oh, but I knew you belonged to him when we first met
But every day we're apart seems like a week
[Verse 1: Smokey Robinson and The Miracles & 
Blood Orange
]
Since I saw you last, there's been many a sunset
You don't need to break it
And every day we're apart seems like a week
Gold is all you see
Oh, but I knew you belonged to him when we first met
I don't even understand
Every day we're apart seems like a week (
Seems like a week
)
[Verse 2: Blood Orange]
Draped in monotony
What's my life gotten me?
Hard to be glorious when two minds meet in the corner
And a story is being told
By me to you
Take another hit, what else to do?
Think about leaving the house
But my fears aren't letting up
[Chorus: The Roches, 
Blood Orange
 & 
Both
]
We'll always love you but
That's not my fault
We'll always love you (
We'll always love you
) but
That's not the point
It's all our fault every time you hear me pay
We always loved you
