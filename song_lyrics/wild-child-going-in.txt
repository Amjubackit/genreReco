I ask for another way home
You say there's just one way to go
But I hope that isn't true
Looks like I'm living a lie
Might say I did everything but try
There's not much I didn't do
I'm going up and up and up and up
I'm going in
I'm going up and up and up and up
I'm going in
I know I left you alone
Can't say you could ever call me home
Girl I know how much it aches
I know there's more to this life
Too many knots to untie
But I know you got what it takes
I'm going up and up and up and up
I'm going in
I'm going up and up and up and up
And going in
