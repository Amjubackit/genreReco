I ask for another way home
You say there's just one way to go
But I hope that isn't true
Looks like I'm living a lie
Might say I did everything but try
There's not much I didn't do
I'm going up and up and up and up
I'm going in
I'm going up and up and up and up
I'm going in
I know I left you alone
Can't say you could ever call me home
Girl I know how much it aches
I know there's more to this life
Too many knots to untie
But I know you got what it takes
I'm going up and up and up and up
I'm going in
I'm going up and up and up and up
And going in
I know you're not alone
So I'm letting it go
There's so much I can't explain
You know that I love
But it wasn't enough
Still I'll see you all again
I'm going up and up and up and up
I'm going in
I'm going up and up and up and up
I'm going in
I'm going up and up and up and up
I'm going in
I'm going up and up and up and up
I'm going in
