[Verse 1]
I wonder if those whispering pines ever told our secrets
'Cause if I have one too many I'll tell you mine
A story of how the first cut is the deepest
And how some old flames just don't fade with time
[Chorus]
We were bottle rockets in a summer love
Shooting for the stars, we were blowing up
Moonlight kisses in a Chevrolet bed
All over my heart, over my head
You were my half pack hider
I was your glovеbox lighter
If I tell you I knew what I was doing, I'm a liar
I was tryna play it cool with a girl on firе
[Verse 2]
I wonder if you ever made it out to Colorado
Or did the Santa Ana's take you to the coast
You mighta tried settling down but you can't what you're not though
You were born to burn just a litte out of control
Trust me, I know
[Chorus]
We were bottle rockets in a summer love
Shooting for the stars, we were blowing up
Moonlight kisses in a Chevrolet bed
All over my heart, over my head
You were my half pack hider
I was your glovebox lighter
If I tell you I knew what I was doing, I'm a liar
I was tryna play it cool with a girl on fire[Bridge]
Like the sky turns at night
When the sun dips down just right
That was us, we were young
We were love on fire
On fire
[Chorus]
We were bottle rockets in a summer love
Shooting for the stars, we were blowing up
Moonlight kisses in a Chevrolet bed
All over my heart, over my head
You were my half pack hider
I was your glovebox lighter
If I tell you I knew what I was doing, I'm a liar
I was tryna play it cool with a girl on fire
[Outro]
Tryna play it cool with a girl on fire
