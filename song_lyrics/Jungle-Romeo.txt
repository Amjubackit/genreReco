[Verse 1: Bas]
Never lose, steady climb, city crime infested
Ten years, so divine my blessings
I injected hope into my lungs
And spoke up things I once
Thought were silly dreams
I'll walk you through the scene
Jump on a jet and it's chartered a star
Batting the cycle, I don't even like her
She deaded, I cannot be bothered to call
Hope you see the light, darling, oh, yes
Running like four legs, thеm people fall
They don't want no run-ins likе bow legs, no
Jumped out the circus like Soleil, curving
My people got me, copy, solid, sterling
[Chorus: Bas]
Steel resolve, look at you
You like a cube of sugar in a pool of water
Bet you will dissolve
Had so much to prove
But no wherewithal, so you got
Nowhere at all, no way out
Either way, it's all gon' play out
It's all gon' play out
