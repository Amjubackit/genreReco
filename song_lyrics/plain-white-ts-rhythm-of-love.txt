[Verse 1]
My head is stuck in the clouds
She begs me to come down
Says, "Boy, quit foolin' around"
I told her, "I love the view from up here
Warm sun and wind in my ear
We'll watch the world from above
As it turns to the rhythm of love"
[Chorus]
We may only have tonight
But 'til the morning sun, you're mine
All mine
Play the music low
And sway to the rhythm of love
[Verse 2]
My heart beats like a drum
A guitar string to the strum
A beautiful song to be sung
She's got blue eyes deep like the sea
That roll back when she's laughing at me
She rises up like the tide
The moment her lips meet mine
[Chorus]
We may only have tonight
But 'til the morning sun, you're mine
All mine
Play the music low
And sway to the rhythm of love
