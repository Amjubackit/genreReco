[Verse 1]
Yeah, I bet she's
Topped off that two-tone tank at the Texaco
Before she hits the road
And I bet she's
Pissed off enough to pick herself up a pack of smokes
Even though she don't
Flip a quarter, roll the dice
It's a left or it's a right
One's goin' my way
And one's hell on a highway
[Chorus]
Heads, it's headlights headed home
Tread left on forgiveness
Tails, it's taillights tailin' off
Floor that Ford, forget this
Is that half ton kickin' up
That last goodbye cloud of dust it's gonna give me
Or does she miss mе?
Tonight, it's lookin' F150-50
Yeah, tonight it's lookin' F150-50
[Verse 2]
And I know Detroit
Done boltеd down and don't mess around underneath that hood
And them horses are running good
So the only thing that's breakin' down
Is maybe that girl's breakin' down
Behind the wheel and I'm breakin' down the odds tonight
