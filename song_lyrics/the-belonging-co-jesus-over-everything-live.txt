[Verse 1]
He came from glory
Took on flesh to save the lost
Grace and mercy displayed up on the cross
Our redemption, He's the hope for all mankind
One name over everything
One name over everything
[Chorus]
Jesus over everything
He reigns forevermore
Our song for all eternity
Jesus Christ is Lord
[Verse 2]
Who can rival our resurrected King
In one moment, he brought dеath to its knees
All the power and all authority
To one namе over everything
One name over everything
[Chorus]
Jesus over everything
He reigns forevermore
Our song for all eternity
Jesus Christ is Lord
Jesus over everything
He reigns forevermore
Our song for all eternity
Jesus Christ is Lord[Interlude]
Yes, this will be our song
This will be our song
Oh, He is Lord
[Bridge]
Over fear, over shame
Over all anxiety
Over troubles, and all pain
Over sickness, and disease
For He reigns on the throne
All praise to Him alone
One name over everything
Over death and all sin
Over hell, over the grave
Darkness bows, demons flee
At the mention of His name
For He reigns on the throne
All praise to Him alone
One name over everything
[Chorus]
Jesus over everything
He reigns forevermore
Our song for all eternity
Jesus Christ is Lord
Jesus over everything
He reigns forevermore
Our song for all eternity
Jesus Christ is Lord[Tag]
Our song for all eternity
Jesus Christ is Lord
Jesus Christ is Lord
