[Verse 1]
Open, blurry, nurture, loving
Crawling, walking, fleeting, glory
Welcome brother, stranger, bloody
Ally, teacher, recess, buddy
Secret, toothless, fairy, pillow
Money, kissing, nervous, hero
Warmly ordinary (this daytime TV satisfies)
Extra ordinary (these hand-me-downs worn in so nice)
[Chorus]
As it may, as it may, as it may, as it may
As it may, as it may, as it may, as it may
Days are fine and come on time
But years leave with nothing to find
[Verse 2]
Changes, hormones, high school, threesome
Roll call, study, license, freedom
Novice, flirting, first time, lover
Party, fighting, wasted, summer
Questions, doubtful, wedding, family
Happy ever after, dead end
Daily iteration (the bestest part of waking up)
Mundane ideation (this dark roast got me so fucked up)[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
As it may, as it may, as it may, as it may
As it may, as it may, as it may, as it may
Days they come and days they go until
No more days set you free
Well on my way, my way to lose... me
[Bridge]
It strikes me that I don’t belong here anymore
As I observe my own reflection, try a happy face
Staring through the warm tears, a sad frown from the cold years
Adieu, I never had the will anyway
[Outro]
Toss a rope over the branch and fall into the night
And here I swing from my family tree, say goodnight
Can't you see life is but a dream anyway...
