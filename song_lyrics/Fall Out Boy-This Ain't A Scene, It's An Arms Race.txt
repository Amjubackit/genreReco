[Verse 1]
I am an arms dealer, fitting you with
Weapons in the form of words
And don't really care which side wins
Long as the room keeps singing, that's just the business I'm in
[Pre-Chorus]
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
I'm not a shoulder to cry on, but I digress
[Chorus]
I'm a leading man
And the lies I weave are oh so intricate (Do-do-do-do-do)
Oh so intricate, yeah (Do-do-do-do-do-do)
I'm a leading man
And the lies I weave are oh so intricate (Do-do-do-do-do)
Oh so intricate, yeah (Do-do-do-do-do-do)
[Verse 2]
I wrote the gospel on giving up
(
You're looking pretty sinking
)
But the real bombshells have already sunk
(
Prima donnas of the gutter
)
At night, we're painting your trash gold while you sleep
Crashing not like hips or cars, no, more like p-p-p-parties
