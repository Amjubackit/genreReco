[Verse 1]
They didn’t know it when they turned me loose
I shot the sheriff and I slipped the noose
[Pre-Chorus]
The law ain’t never been a friend of mine
I would kill again to keep from doing time
You should never ever trust my kind
[Chorus]
I’m a wanted man
I got blood on my hands
Do you understand?
I’m a wanted man
[Verse 2]
I took the pistol and I shot out all the lights
I started running in the middle of the night
[Pre-Chorus]
The law ain’t never been a friend of mine
I would kill again to keep from doing time
You should never ever trust my kind
[Chorus]
I’m a wanted man
I got blood on my hands
Do you understand?
I’m a wanted man
I’m a wanted man
I got blood on my hands
Do you understand?
I’m a wanted man
[Bridge]
If you ask me to change
I don’t know if I can
I’ll always be who I am
[Chorus]
I’m a wanted man
I got blood on my hands
Do you understand?
I’m a wanted man
I’m a wanted man
I got blood on my hands
Do you understand?
I’m a wanted man
[Outro]
I’m a wanted man
I’m a wanted man
Do you understand?
I’m a wanted man
