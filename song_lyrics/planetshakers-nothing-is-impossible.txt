[Chorus: Joth Hunt, Israel Houghton]
Through You, I can do anything
I can do all things
For it's You who gives me strength
Nothing is impossible
Through You, blind eyes are opened
Strongholds are broken
I am living by faith
Nothing is impossible
[Interlude: Israel Houghton]
Yeah
Nothing is impossible
Oh-ooh
[Verse: Joth Hunt, Israel Houghton]
I'm not gonna live by what I see
I'm not gonna live by what I feel
[Pre-Chorus: Joth Hunt, Israel Houghton]
Deep down I, know that You're here with me (Here with me)
And I know that, You can do anything
[Chorus: Both]
Through You, I can do anything
I can do all things
For it's You who gives me strength
Nothing is impossible
Through You, blind eyes are opened
Strongholds are broken
I am living by faith
Nothing is impossible
[Interlude: Israel Houghton]
Woah-ooh
Nothing is impossible
Woah-ooh
[Verse: Israel Houghton]
I'm not gonna live by what I see
No, I'm not gonna live by what I feel
Hey
[Pre-Chorus: Israel Houghton, Joth Hunt]
Deep down I, know that You're here with me (Here with me)
And I know that, You can do anything
[Chorus: Both]
Through You, I can do anything
I can do all things
For it's You who gives me strength
Nothing is impossible
Through You, blind eyes are opened
Strongholds are broken
I am living by faith
Nothing is impossible
[Interlude: Israel Houghton]
Woah-ooh
Nothing is impossible
[Bridge: Both, Israel Houghton]
I believe, I believe (Oh)
I believe, I believe in You
I believe, I believe (Yeah)
I believe, I believe in You
I believe, I believe (Yeah)
I believe, I believe in You (I believe in You)
I believe, I believe (Oh)
I believe, I believe in You
[Chorus: Both]
Through You, I can do anything
I can do all things
For it's You who gives me strength
Nothing is impossible
Through You, blind eyes are opened
Strongholds are broken
I am living by faith
Nothing is impossible
[Outro: Joth Hunt, Israel Houghton, Both]
I believe, I believe (I believe, I believe)
I believe, I believe in You (Whoa)
I believe, I believe (Oh)
I believe, I believe in You
