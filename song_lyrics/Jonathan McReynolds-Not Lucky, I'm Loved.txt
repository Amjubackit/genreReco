[Verse 1]
Maybe I succeeded a little
I jumped up from the floor to the middle
You think I want the credit, I don't
'Cause the glory ain't made for me
But I know who sits on the throne
Who makes the stage and writes the songs
And I know I couldn't do this on my own
And as much as I complain, I've seen more sunshine than rain
[Pre-Chorus]
And I could thank my lucky stars
But that's not where my blessings are
No, they come from the Father's heart
Not the sky, not chance
The truth is...
[Chorus]
I'm not lucky, I'm loved
I'm not lucky, I'm loved
I'm not lucky, I'm loved
I'm not lucky, I'm loved
[Verse 2]
Today I'm in a happy place
And I know it didn't happen by mistake
I love how He wrote my life
And I love how He sees my heart
So I fall to me knees and I say that I'm grateful when every morning starts
