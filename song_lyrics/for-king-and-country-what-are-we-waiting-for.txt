[Intro: Joel Smallbone]
What are we waiting for? (Waiting oh, waiting oh)
So what are we waiting for (Waiting for, oh-oh-oh-oh)
[Verse 1: Joel Smallbone & 
Luke Smallbone
]
Can't be what we can't see
Can't speak if we can't breathe
Can't dance if we don't move our feet
It's a blur tryin' to keep pace
Days running like we're in a race
Can't move if we're in our own way
I guess the crisis is
We've just one life to live
And no one knows what happens next
[Chorus: Joel Smallbone]
So what are we waiting for? What are we waiting for?
Why are we wasting all the time like someone's making morе?
What are we praying for? What are wе saving for?
What if we could be the light that no one could ignore?
What are we waiting for?
Waiting, oh, waiting for, waiting for
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Put the pen on a new page
Dream about what you could change
And live it out before it's too late
The beauty of it is
We've just one life to live
And no one knows what happens next, no[Chorus: Joel Smallbone &
