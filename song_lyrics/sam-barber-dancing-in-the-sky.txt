[Chorus]
And I hope you're dancin' in the sky
And I hope you're singin' in the angels' choir
And I hope them angels know what they have
I bet it's so nice up in Heaven since you arrived
[Verse]
Tell me, what does it look like in Heaven?
Is it peaceful? Is it free like they say?
Does the sun shine bright forever?
Have your fears and your pain gone away?
[Chorus]
And I hope you're dancin' in the sky
And I hope you're singin' in the angels' choir
And I hope them angels know what they have
'Cause I bet it's so nice up in Heaven since you arrived
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Chorus]
And I hope you're dancin' in the sky
And I hope you're singin' in the angel choir
And I hope them angels know what they have
'Cause I bet it's so nice up in Heaven since you arrived
