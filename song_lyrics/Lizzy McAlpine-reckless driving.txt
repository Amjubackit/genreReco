[Verse 1: Lizzy McAlpine]
I didn't mean to kiss you
I mean I did, but I didn’t think it'd go this far
I didn't mean to kiss you
Now you can’t focus on the road when I'm in your car
[Pre-Chorus: Lizzy McAlpine]
Now we're going one hundred
Your hands aren't on the wheel
'Cause you're just staring at me like you're not convinced that I am real
And now we're at one eighty
And I can finally see
But then it’s over in a second, 
crashed the car into the
 
tree
Yeah, I can see it all happen
You’d rather die than take your eyes off me
[Chorus: Lizzy McAlpine]
I don't love you like that
I’m a careful driver
And I tell you all the timе to keep your eyes on the road
But you lovе me like that
You're a reckless driver
And one day it'll kill us if I don't let go
[Verse 2: Ben Kessler]
I don’t know how to tell you
That I feel safe when you sit shotgun
Never felt this way with no one
And I lie when I tell you
I know exactly where we're going
I get lost just for this moment
