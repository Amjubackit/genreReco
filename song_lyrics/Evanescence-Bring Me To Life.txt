[Verse 1: Amy Lee]
How can you see into my eyes
Like open doors?
Leading you down into my core
Where I've become so numb
[Pre-Chorus: Amy Lee]
Without a soul
My spirit's sleeping somewhere cold
Until you find it there and lead it back home
[Chorus: Paul McCoy & 
Amy Lee
]
(Wake me up) 
Wake me up inside
(I can't wake up) 
Wake me up inside
(Save me) 
Call my name and 
save
 me from the dark
(Wake me up) 
Bid my blood to run
(I can't wake up) 
Before I come undone
(Save me) 
Save me from the nothing I've become
[Verse 2: Amy Lee]
Now that I know what I'm without
You can't just leave me (Oh, oh-oh)
Breathe into me and make me real (Make me real)
Bring me to life (Bring, me)
[Chorus: Paul McCoy & 
Amy Lee
]
(Wake me up) 
Wake me up inside
(I can't wake up) 
Wake me up inside
(Save me) 
Call my name and save me from the dark
(Wake me up) 
Bid my blood to run
(I can't wake up) 
Before I come undone
(Save me) 
Save me from the nothing I've become
