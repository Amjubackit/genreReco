[Verse 1]
Our atmosphere
Bowing in reverence
You're in our midst
We cannot ignore it
We hear Your steps
We feel Your Kingdom
Jesus, You're taking over
[Verse 2]
Treasures and crowns
Down at Your feet
Honor and fame
Only belong to You
You are before
Everything
Grasping it all together
[Pre-Chorus]
One, just One, just One found worthy
One, just One, just One
[Chorus]
Holy is the Lord on high
Your glory fills the temple
Holy is the Lord on high
Holy is the Lord on high
We join in with the elders
Holy is the Lord on high[Verse 3]
Unto the Lamb
Beaten and bruised
Killed for our sin
You were the sacrifice
Raised from the dead
Breathing again
Our Jewish King
Seated in majesty
[Pre-Chorus]
One, just One, just One found worthy
One, just One, just One (One)
One, just One, just One found worthy
One, just One, just One
[Chorus]
Holy is the Lord on high
Your glory fills the temple
Holy is the Lord on high
Holy is the Lord on high
We join in with the elders
Holy is the Lord on high
Holy is the Lord
Holy is the Lord on high
Your glory fills the temple
Holy is the Lord on high
Holy is the Lord on high
We join in with the elders
Holy is the Lord on high[Spontaneous]
Lifted up
You're lifted up high
High, high, high
All the earth is Your footstool, Lord
Lifted up
So much higher
So much higher, yes
Unto the Lamb, unto the Lamb
[Bridge]
And unto the Lamb, unto the Lamb
This beautiful Man who reigns forever
Glory to God in the highest
We praise You
Unto the Lamb, unto the Lamb
This beautiful Man who reigns forever
Glory to God in the highest
We praise You
Unto the Lamb, unto the Lamb
This beautiful Man who reigns forever
Glory to God in the highest
We praise You
Unto the Lamb, unto the Lamb
This beautiful Man who reigns forever
Glory to God in the highest
We praise You[Tag]
We praise You, Lord of lords
We praise You, King of kings over everything
We praise You
Whoa-oa
[Chorus]
Holy is the Lord on high
Your glory fills the temple
Holy is the Lord on high
Holy is the Lord on high
We join in with the elders
Holy is the Lord on high
[Bridge]
Unto the Lamb
And unto the Lamb, unto the Lamb
This beautiful Man who reigns forever
Glory to God in the highest
We praise You
Unto the Lamb, unto the Lamb
This beautiful Man who reigns forever
Glory to God in the highest
We praise You
[Interlude]
[Outro]
Unto the Lamb, unto the Lamb
This beautiful Man who reigns forever
Glory to God in the highest
We praise You
Unto the Lamb, unto the Lamb
This beautiful Man who reigns...
