[Verse 1]
The mouth of my suitcase
Says I'm making a big mistake
I'll pay for it one day
Just not today, today, today
Running shoes that I can't lace
Big balloons that I can't inflate
A crayon and a blank slate
Pulls me away, away, away
[Pre-Chorus]
You're gutted
I'm leaving
So sad to go
[Chorus]
I'm leaving my heart in San Francisco
My tall strawberry blonde that
Oh, I'll miss so
I'll send you a postcard when I get where I've gotta be
But something is calling me
I'm sorry
[Verse 2]
A castle in quicksand
I'm a fool with a bird in hand
Who's trading his dreamland
Even I don't understand
And now I glitter with envy
Of your new version without me
I'm only stupid, don't hate me
I'm tryna do the best I can
