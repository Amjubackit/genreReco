[Verse 1]
Take me back in time again
Stay with me like you did then
Take me as you find me here
Take me now, feel me near
[Chorus]
Love like I never knew before
Someday will fade and be ignored
Nothing is forever anymore
[Verse 2]
Wrap me up in quiet sins
Take me lost, make me found
Hold me silent in the night
Say, "I'm wrong, make me right"
[Chorus]
Love like I never knew before
Someday will fade and be ignored
Slippin' through my fingers, wantin' more
[Bridge]
Hanging on to every word
Whispered as the morning stirs
