[Verse 1]
If I die today, it won’t be so bad
I can't escape all the nightmares I’ve had
All of my angry and all of my sad
Gone in the blink of an eye
I’ve seen the devil, I’ve shaken his hand
I’ve seen the evil that dwells in a man
For all of my wisdom, I can’t understand
Oh mercy me, mercy my
[Pre-Chorus]
Better get to digging while my body’s getting cold
I keep tryna fight it so just promise when I go
[Chorus]
You’ll bury me low
Bury me low
Bury me low
Just promise me that when I go
You’ll bury me low
[Verse 2]
If I die today, it won’t be so hard
Everything scares me but never the dark
Stay acting brave, but I’m too faint of heart
To pull out the thorn in my side
If I meet God, I'mma make him explain
Where was his help when I wanted to change
Is everything crazy, or just in my brain
Oh mercy me, mercy my[Pre–Chorus]
Better get to digging while my body’s getting cold
I keep tryna fight it so just promise when I go
[Chorus]
You’ll bury me low
Bury me low
Bury me low
Just promise me that when I go
You’ll bury me low
[Bridge]
Some things fade, some get saved
Some things are made just to take to the grave
Some things fade, some get saved
Some things are made just to take to the grave
Love and hate, Hope and faith
Some things are made just to take to the grave
Some things are made just to take to the grave
Some things are made just to take to the, take to the grave
[Outro]
Just promise me that when I go
You'll bury me low
Bury me low
Bury me low
Just promise me that when I go
You'll bury me low
