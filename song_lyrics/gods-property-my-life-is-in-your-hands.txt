[Intro: Kirk Franklin]
No matter what you're going through
I know that you can stand
For your life is in, in His hands
Listen
[Verse 1: God's Property, 
Kirk Franklin
]
You don't have to worry
And don't you be afraid
Joy comes in the morning
Troubles, they don't last always
For there's a friend in Jesus (
Hallelujah
)
Who will wipe your tears away (
Yeah
)
And if your heart is broken
Just lift your hands and say
[Chorus: God's Property, 
Kirk Franklin

Oh, I know that I can make it
(
I know that I can stand
)
I know that I can stand
(
No matter what comes my way

No matter what may come my way

Jesus, my life

My life is in your hands
