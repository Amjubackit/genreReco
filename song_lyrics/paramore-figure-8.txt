[Verse 1]
Drained me dry, down to the last drop
Pearls before swine, all flowers die
Tapped the last good vein
Don't know how to shut it off
[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, once you get me going
(I don't know how to stop, I don't know how to stop)
Once you get me going
(I don't know how to stop, I don't know how to)
[Chorus]
All for your sake
Became the very thing that I hate
I lost my way
Spinnin' in an endless figure eight
[Verse 2]
I won't miss the feelin'
My flimsy spine, unsuspicious mind
I was only bein' kind
But you mistook me for weak
[Pre-Chorus]
And once I get going, mm
I don't know how to stop, I don't know how to stop
Going
I don't know how to stop, I don't know how to
[Chorus]
All for your sake
Became the very thing that I hate
I lost my way
Spinnin' in an endless figure eight
[Bridge]
Candlelight, candlelight
Burnin' 'til broad daylight
Candlelight, candlelight
Burnin' at both ends tonight
How could I? How could I?
If I'm made of thin ice
How could I? How could I?
You'd be wise if you thought twice
[Chorus]
All for your sake
Became the very thing that I hate
I lost my way
Spinnin' in an endless figure
What remains
And now I think I'm losing my shape
Not a trace
No end and no beginning, figure eight
