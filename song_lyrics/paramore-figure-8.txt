[Verse 1]
Drained me dry, down to the last drop
Pearls before swine
, 
all flowers die
Tapped the last good vein
Don't know how to shut it off
[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, once you get me going
(I don't know how to stop, I don't know how to stop)
Once you get me going
(I don't know how to stop, I don't know how to)
[Chorus]
All for your sake
Became the very thing that I hate
I lost my way
Spinnin' in an endless figure eight
[Verse 2]
I won't miss the feelin'
My flimsy spine, unsuspicious mind
I was only bein' kind
But you mistook me for weak
[Pre-Chorus]
And once I get going, mm
I don't know how to stop, I don't know how to stop
Going
I don't know how to stop, I don't know how to
