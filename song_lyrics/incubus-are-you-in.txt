[Verse 1]
It’s so much better
When everyone is in, are you in?
It’s so much better
When everyone is in, are you in?
[Chorus]
Ooh, hoo
Ooh, hoo, are you in?
Ooh, hoo
Ooh, hoo, are you in?
[Verse 2]
It’s so much better
When everyone is in, are you in?
It’s so much easier
When sea foam green is in fashion
[Chorus]
Ooh, hoo
Ooh, hoo
Are you in?
Ooh, hoo
Ooh, hoo
Are you...[Bridge]
Are you, are you, are you, are you
Are you, are you, are you, are you
Are you, are you, are you, are you
Are you, are you, are you, are you
(Everybody in, every
Everybody in, every
Everybody in, every
Everybody in, every)
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh no, oh oh no
[Pre-Chorus]
(A-are, you in
A-are, are
You, you, i-i-in)
[Outro]
Ooh, hoo
Ooh, hoo
Are you in?
Ooh, hoo
Ooh, hoo, hoo
