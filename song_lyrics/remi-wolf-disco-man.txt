He likes his cherries when they’re maraschino
He likes his movies when they're Tarantino
He never stops he’s always ready to go
Gas station glasses on his way to Rio
Yeah he get it , yeah he get it
We got drunk I don’t regret it
Said that he’s a disco man
And he’s got a lot of fiscal plans
And I told him he could kiss my hand
If ya meet me at the disco, disco
Said that he’s a disco man
And he’s got a lot of fiscal plans
And I told him he could kiss my hand
If ya meet me at the disco, disco
And he’s never tongue tied, he’s alright
Always dressed in black tie with white guys
Naked in the sunshine, to tan lines
And he’s wasted all his money, but he's never been a waste of time
Said that he’s a disco man
And he’s got a lot of fiscal plans
And I told him he could kiss my hand
If ya meet me at the disco, disco
Said that he’s a disco man
And he’s got a lot of fiscal plans
And I told him he could kiss my hand
If ya meet me at the disco, disco manYeah he get it, yeah he get it
We got drunk I don’t regret it
Said that he’s a disco man
And he’s got a lot of fiscal plans
And I told him he could kiss my hand
If ya meet me at the disco, disco
Said that he’s a disco man
And he’s got a lot of fiscal plans
And I told him he could kiss my hand
If he meet me at the disco, disco man
Buh duh we on fire
Disco man
And he’s got a lot of fiscal plans
And I told him he could kiss my hand
If ya meet me at the disco, disco  man
