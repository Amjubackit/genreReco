[Verse 1]
What's up? Hello, I'm tryna meet ya
Shocked at the words comin' from my tongue
A language that I'm not familiar, oh
Don't take it away, I wanna play, where did the time fly?
What if I pray? Hopin' you'll stay into the daylight
Wait, what am I sayin'? I feel insane
It's only been a couple days
[Chorus]
I'm havin' the same thoughts, can't stop
Thinkin' you've got me brainwashed
I'm see-through, need you
Why do I think you're so cool?
Everything's clean except for my thoughts (Yeah)
Thinkin' about me gettin' you off
It's been a week, I'm still at your house
I don't wanna leave, it's freakin' me out
[Post-Chorus]
Oh, I don't wanna leave, it's freakin' me out
Oh, oh
[Verse 2]
Why am I actin' like that?
My day's fucked 'til you finally wanna text back
I put some extra on my laugh when you say things
Are you really that funny or am I hallucinatin'? Like
I'm slippin' away, livin' the life, opened the floodgates
Give me my space, give me your face at the same time
It's like my brain isn't mine, you moved into my mind
Dropped your bags, drew the blinds[Chorus]
Now I'm havin' the same thoughts, can't stop
Thinkin' you've got me brainwashed
I'm see-through, need you
Why do I think you're so cool? 
(One, two, one, two, three, four)
Everything's clean except for my thoughts (Yeah)
Thinkin' about me gettin' you off
It's been a week, I'm still at your house
I don't wanna leave, it's freakin' me out
[Post-Chorus]
Oh, I don't wanna leave, it's freakin' me out
Oh, oh
[Bridge]
The syndrome feels Stockholm
I'm like, "Do you wanna keep me on lock though?" Yeah
Symmetrical feelings
Match best when we're starin' at the ceilin' (Yeah)
The syndrome feels Stockholm
I'm like, "Do you wanna keep me on lock though?" Yeah
Symmetrical feelings
Match best when we're starin' at the ceilin'
[Chorus]
I'm havin' the same thoughts, can't stop
Thinkin' you've got me brainwashed
I'm see-through, need you
Why do I think you're so cool?
Everything's clean except for my thoughts (Yeah)
Thinkin' about me gettin' you off (Gettin' you off)
It's been a week, I'm still at your house
I don't wanna leave, it's freakin' me out[Post-Chorus]
Oh, I don't wanna leave, it's freakin' me out
Oh, oh
