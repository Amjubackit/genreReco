VERSE 1
You are not hidden
There’s never been a moment
That you were forgotten
You are not hopeless
Though you have been broken
Your innocence stolen
PRE CHORUS
I hear you whisper underneath your breath
I hear your SOS, your SOS
CHORUS 1
I will send out an army to find you
In the middle of the darkest night
It’s true, I will rescue you
VERSE 2
There is no distance
That cannot be covered
Over and over
You’re not defеnseless
Oh, I’ll be your shеlter
I’ll be your armor
CHORUS 2
Oh I, I will send out an army to find you
In the middle of the darkest night
It’s true, I will rescue you
Oh, oh I, I will, I’ll never stop marching to reach you
In the middle of the hardest fight
It’s true, I will rescue you
CHANNEL
I’ll never stop reaching
I’ll never stop reaching
I’ll never stop reaching and running
And searching for wherever you are
CHORUS 3
I, I will send out an army to find you
In the middle of the darkest night
It’s true, I will rescue you
Oh I, I will, I’ll never stop marching to reach you
In the middle of the hardest fight
It’s true, I will rescue you
