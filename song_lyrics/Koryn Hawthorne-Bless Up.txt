[Verse 1]
Tell me, where do I begin? You were like my favourite friend
I'm singing ever since the first date, I never wanted this to end
This was love at first sight, yeah, love at first sight
When everything was going wrong You made it alright
[Pre-Chorus]
You told me I'm better, better than I knew
Now, You helped me do all things, all things in You
Tell me where do I begin? You were like my favourite friend
Love so incredible, never want it to end
[Chorus]
Oh, how I love You, let's stay together
I wanna bless up, I'm talking 'bout bless up
I wanna know You, know You better
Come on and bless up, I'm talking 'bout bless up
Wanna tell everybody, gotta tell everybody
That You are the greatest and You can't be replaced
Oh, how I love You, let's stay together
I wanna bless up, come on, let's bless up
[Verse 2]
The question is will I leave Ya?
The answer is 'oh no'
Just ask my friends, they know
When it comes to You I'm sold
Where You lead me I'ma follow
Where You lead me I'ma follow
Not talking 'bout pics on the gram
But when You lead me I'm a follow
