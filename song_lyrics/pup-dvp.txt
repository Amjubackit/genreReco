[Verse 1]
Your sister thinks that I'm a freak
She's been ignorin' my calls, we haven't spoken in a week
I get so drunk that I can't speak
Yeah, nothing's workin', and our future's lookin' bleak, and I said
[Chorus]
(Whoo, whoo, whoo-ooh, whoo, whoo-ooh)
Three beers and I'm so messed up
Get drunk and I can't shut up
(Whoo, whoo, whoo-ooh, whoo, whoo-ooh)
She says that I drink too much
I'm fucked up and she hates my guts
She says I need to grow up
[Verse 2]
I'm drivin' fast to get away
Doin' one-eighty on the Don Valley Parkway
Yeah, I'd be better off dead
I don't give a shit, I just don't wanna die, and I don't want to live, I said
[Chorus]
(Whoo, whoo, whoo-ooh, whoo, whoo-ooh)
Three beers and I'm so messed up
Get drunk and I can't shut up
(Whoo, whoo, whoo-ooh, whoo, whoo-ooh)
She says that I drink too much
Fucked up and she hates my guts
She says I need to grow up[Bridge]
I drink 'til I'm starin' at the ceilin'
I'll be just fine (I'm numb and losin' feelin')
I can't tell lies anymore
[Chorus]
(Whoo, whoo, whoo-ooh, whoo, whoo-ooh)
Three beers and I'm so messed up
Get drunk and I can't shut up
(Whoo, whoo, whoo-ooh, whoo, whoo-ooh)
She says that I drink too much
Fucked up and she hates my guts
(Whoo, whoo, whoo-ooh, whoo, whoo-ooh)
I just don't know what to do
I'm still fucked up over you
(Whoo, whoo, whoo-ooh, whoo, whoo-ooh)
She says that I drink too much
Hawaiian red fruit punch
She says I need to grow up
