[Verse 1]
Oh, when it's cold
I get warm just thinking of you
When I'm alone
I stare at stars and hope dreams come true
[Pre-Chorus]
You're probably not aware that I'm even here
Well you might not know I exist, but I don't even care
[Chorus]
Sweet talk, 
everything you say
It sounds like sweet talk to my ears
You could yell, "Piss off! Won't you stay away?"
It'll still be sweet talk to my ears
[Verse 2]
Oh, when you laugh
I forget that it's about me
But it's alright
Yeah, cause being your punchline still is something
[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, well, I'm not scared, I'm not going nowhere
Yeah, you might want me to drop dead, but I don't even care[Chorus]
Sweet talk, everything you say
It sounds like sweet talk to my ears
You could yell, "Piss off! Won't you stay away?"
It'll still be sweet talk to my ears
[Break]
Ooh, everything you say
It sounds like, ooh, to my ears
Ooh, "Won't you stay away?"
It sounds like, ooh, to my ears
[Chorus]
Sweet talk, everything you say
It sounds like sweet talk to my ears
You could yell, "Piss off! Won't you stay away?"
It'll still be sweet talk to my ears
