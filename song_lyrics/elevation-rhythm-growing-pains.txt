[Verse 1]
Why do I fear what I cannot control in my life?
Why do I forget that the fire is how I'm refined?
[Pre-Chorus]
I try, and I try, and I try
To keep pressing on with hopes high
But sometimes I fall, God, through it all
I know You'll be my side
There's no guarantee in this life
Yeah, trouble's a matter of time
But You're in control, that's how I know
[Chorus]
Everything gon' be okay
It won't always be this way
At my worst, when it hurts, won't be afraid
Sometimes faith has growing pains
[Verse 2]
You're the light
Leading me on through the depths of the night
You're the prize
Waiting for me at the end of this life
[Pre-Chorus]
So, I try, and I try, and I try
To keep prеssing on with hopes high
But sometimes I fall, God, through it all
I know You'll bе my side
There's no guarantee in this life
Yeah, trouble's a matter of time
But You're in control, that's how I know
[Chorus]
Everything gon' be okay (Okay)
It won't always be this way (It won't always be this way)
At my worst, when it hurts, won't be afraid (No, no, no)
Sometimes faith has growing pains
Yeah, everything gon' be okay (Okay, yeah)
This will all make sense one day
At my worst, when it hurts, won't be afraid
Sometimes faith has growing pains
[Post-Chorus]
Sometimes faith has growing pains
Sometimes faith has growing pains (Oh)
There's no gain without the pain (Learning to trust You)
Sometimes faith has growing pains
[Chorus]
Everything gon' be okay, okay
It won't always be this way (This way)
At my worst, when it hurts, won't be afraid
'Cause I know sometimes faith has growing pains
Yeah, everything gon' be okay
This will all make sense one day (It's gonna make sense)
At my worst, when it hurts, won't be afraid (Don't be afraid)
Sometimes faith has growing pains
[Bridge]
(Yeah) Better believe it
Before you can see it (Before you can see it)
Before you can feel it
Keep walking through fire
Keep facing the giant (Facing the giant)
'Cause faith is a fighter, oh
[Chorus]
Everything gon' be okay
It won't always be this way
At my worst, when it hurts, won't be afraid (I won't be afraid)
Sometimes faith has growing pains
