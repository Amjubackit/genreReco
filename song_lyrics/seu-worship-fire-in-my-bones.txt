[Verse 1]
Before the dawn of space and time
The Word You spoke created light
From Eden unto Heaven's gates
Your redemption leads the way
[Pre-Chorus]
Even when I couldn't see it, even when I can't believe it
You are by my side
[Chorus]
And now sings my soul
You never let me go
And after all this time
There's no doubt in Your mind
The one thing I know
You're the fire in my bones
And to the end of time
Your light will never die
[Verse 2]
Past and present, sought Your face
Time and time, again You came
Faith and future now align
Revival is what we prophesy[Chorus]
And now sings my soul
You never let me go
And after all this time
There's no doubt in Your mind
The one thing I know
You're the fire in my bones
And to the end of time
Your light will never die
[Interlude]
[Bridge]
Long before my first mistake
Your mercy called me by my name
God, You found me, You'll always have me
Faithfulness from age to age
Will tell the wonder of Your name
God, You're worthy of all Your glory
Long before my first mistake
Your mercy called me by my name
God, You found me and You'll always have me
Faithfulness from age to age
Will tell the wonder of Your name
God, You're worthy of all Your glory[Chorus]
And now sings my soul
You never let me go
And after all this time
There's no doubt in Your mind
The one thing I know
You're the fire in my bones
And to the end of time
Your light will never die
[Outro]
God, You found me and You'll always have me
God, You're worthy of all Your glory
