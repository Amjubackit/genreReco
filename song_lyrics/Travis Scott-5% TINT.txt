[Chorus]
Who's that creeping through my window?
'Fore you come outside, I got the M4
Took her to the endzone from the Enzo
Know I love to smoke, you love the liq' more
Wanna hit the Jack, then what you call for?
All that out-your-name shit, that ain't called for, mm
[Verse 1]
Who that creepin'? Know the tint is dark (Five percent)
All that fall-in-love shit, gotta Kevin Hart (Yeah, yeah)
All that speed and fly shit, we might teleport, yeah (Skrrt, skrrt)
All that cop harass shit, I might clip a sarge', yeah (12)
Keep bouncin' that ass, you just might get award, yeah
If she bad, she get a pass into the tour (Passes, yeah)
I pick through the family, grab the bad sister like Janet
Opps outside, don't panic, gotta switch, gotta change up transit
Still jump around, move antsy, and I still don't like shit fancy
Up late feelin' real chancy, they outside really tryna end me, yeah
[Chorus]
Who's that creeping through my window? (My window)
'Fore you come outside, I got the M4 (M4)
Took her to the endzone from the Enzo (Yah)
Know I love to smoke, you love to lick more (Yah-yah)
Wanna hit the Jack, then what you call for? (Yah-ah)
All that out-your-name shit, that ain't called for (Yah)
