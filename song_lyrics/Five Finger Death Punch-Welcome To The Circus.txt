[Intro]
Welcome to the circus
[Verse 1]
Welcome to the shit show
Just another freak show
Hang your hat and hate at the door
It's a game of torture
Souls are made to order
Everything you wanted and more
[Pre-Chorus 1]
You've gotta kill somebody to thrill somebody
Everybody's gotta reason to bleed
You've gotta fuck somebody to know somebody
That motherfucker ain't me
[Chorus]
Am I the only one
That doesn't buy into the lies?
Am I the only one
That doesn't wear a disguise?
'Cause if I can't break it
And I can't change it
Then tell me, how will I know? (Tell me, how will I?)
Am I the only one
That isn't just here for the show?
Welcome to the circus
