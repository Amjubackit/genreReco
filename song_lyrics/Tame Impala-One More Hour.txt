[Verse 1]
Just a moment
Right before all the song and dance
Wasn't brave enough to tell you
But there ain't gonna be another chance
It's not long until (All that I have)
And everything's still (One more hour)
Minutes are racing, whatever I've done
I did it for love (All that I have)
I did it for fun (One more hour)
Couldn't get enough (All that I have)
I did it for fame (One more hour)
But never for money
Not for houses, not for her
Not for my future children
Until now
[Verse 2]
How could I love again?
How could I ever ask for more?
And to the road ahead
Into a life I can't ignore
(Lose her) How could I love again?
(Move on) How can I walk this path for sure?
(Lose her) With no more time to spare
(Move on) I know the answer more and more
