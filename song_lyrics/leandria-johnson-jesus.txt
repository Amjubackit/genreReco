Call him when you want him
Look at myself in the mirror
Religion lookin' back at me
I threw my hands in the air
And the law arrested me
Girl interrupted
I needed to break out and get freedom
One bad decision after the next
Just getting by, letting you figure me
Jesus, call him when you want him
Call him when you need him
But Jesus yeah Jesus yeah
Jesus, oh Jesus, yeah
Curses unbroken
Still holding me down
Bondage, I was even thinking
I wasn't good enough for God's best
But I'm in my closet
Yes I am, I'm in my closet
Time after time
Praying Jesus, singing Jesus, crying Jesus
Jesus, call him when you want him (Call him)
Call him when you need him (Call him, oh call him Jesus)
Jesus, there is no other like him in my life
Religion died in my life, yeah Jesus
Call him when you want him (Call him)
Call him when you need him
You gotta get down on your knees and call on Jesus, I dare you
I dare you to think of one thing and testify
Testify to yourself, hey
Our father Jesus which art in heaven Jesus
Hallowed be thy name Jesus, thy kingdom come Jesus
No no no other name Jesus
Oh Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus
Je Je Je Je Je Je Je Je Je-Je-Je-Je-Jesus
Oh my God, this is, Jesus
Call him when you want him
Call him when you need him, Jesus
