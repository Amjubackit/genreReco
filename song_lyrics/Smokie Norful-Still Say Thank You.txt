I've had sins and I've had pain
My heart has been broken
And my life has been strained
But in spite of everything I've been through
I still gotta say thank You
I've been up and I've been down
Had my life turn, turn, turn
Completely around
But in spite of everything I've been through
I still I gotta say thank You
Thank You, thank You
For Your many blessings
(For Your blessings)
In spite of my mess
(In spite of my mess)
Lord, You looked down and You blessed me
(For Your blessings)
Even in the midst of my test
(In the midst of my test)
(In spite of everything)
In spite of everything
(I've been through)
I still gotta say thank You
Thank You, Jesus
