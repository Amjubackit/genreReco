[Verse 1]
I met her on my way to Chicago
Where she was all alone and so was I
So I asked her for her name
She smiled and looked at me
I was surprised to see
That a woman like that was really into me
[Chorus]
She said she didnâ€™t have no man
Raised the kids the very best she can (She was lovin' me)
She told me she was all alone
Said, "I don't," she didn't have no phone (She was wantin' me)
She said just to give her a page
Fifty nine was the code she gave (She was lovin' me)
She'd lied to you, lied to me
'Cause she was lovin' me, lovin' me, yeah
[Verse 2]
I never would've thought she was livin' like that
Her words seemed so sincere
When I held her near, she would tell me how she feels
It felt so real to me
This girl, she had to be
An angel sent from heaven just for me
