[Verse 1]
Oh, shame is a prison as cruel as a grave
Shame is a robber and he's come to take my name
Oh, love is my redeemer, lifting me up from the ground
Love is the power when my freedom song is found
[Chorus]
There ain’t no grave
Gonna hold my body down
There ain't no grave
Gonna hold my body down
When I hear that trumpet sound
I'm gonna rise up outta the ground
There ain’t no grave
Gonna hold my body down
Ohh, oh-oh-ohh-oh-oh-ohh
Ohh, oh-oh-ohh-oh-oh-ohh
[Verse 2]
Oh, fear is a liar with a smooth and velvet tongue
Fear is a tyrant, he's always telling me to run
Oh, love is a resurrection and love is a trumpet sound
Love is my weapon, I'm gonna take my giants down
[Chorus]
There ain't no grave
Gonna hold my body down
There ain't no grave
Gonna hold my body down
And when I hear that trumpet sound
I'm gonna rise up outta the ground
There ain't no grave
Gonna hold my body down
[Interlude]
[Verse 3]
Oh, there was a battle, a war between death and life
And there on a tree, the Lamb of God was crucified
And He went on down to hell, He took back every key
He rose up as a lion and He set all captives free
[Chorus]
There ain't no grave
Could hold His body down
There ain’t no grave
Could hold His body down
When He heard the trumpet sound
He rose up outta the ground
There ain’t no grave
Could hold His body down
There ain't no grave
Could hold His body down
[Post-Chorus]
There ain’t no grave
Could hold my body down
There ain't no grave
Could hold my body down
[Spontaneous]
Oh, if You walked out of the grave, I'm walking too
If You walked out of the grave, I'm walking too
If You walked out of the grave, I’m walking too
If You walked out of the grave, I'm walking too
If You walked out of the grave, I'm walking too
If You walked out of the grave, I'm walking too
Gonna sing about it, yeah
If You walked out of the grave, I'm walking too
I'm gonna meet Jesus
If You walked out of the grave, I'm walking too
Oh, if You walked out of the grave, I'm walking too
If You walked out of the grave, I'm walking too
If You walked out of the grave, I'm walking too
If You walked out of the grave, I'm walking too
[Chorus]
There ain't no grave
Gonna hold my body down
There ain't no grave
Gonna hold my body down
And when I hear that trumpet sound
I'm gonna rise up outta the ground
There ain't no grave
Gonna hold my body down
There ain't no grave
Gonna hold my body down
There ain't no grave
Gonna hold my body down
