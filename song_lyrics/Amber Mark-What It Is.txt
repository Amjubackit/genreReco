[Verse 1]
I, I gave it my all, I tried
But nothing could stop this fire
So hard to leave it all behind
And I know
The good with the bad, we fall
What is the point of it all? Mmm
[Pre-Chorus]
So there goes my heart
I fell apart
Trying to love
Wanna be free
So, God, tell me please
Is it in the stars? Oh
[Chorus]
Feel it in my bones
Oh, I've got to know
Tell me what it is, it is (What it is, what it is, what it is)
It is, it is (What it is, what it is, what it is)
On my mind always, at least three times a day
Tell me what it is, it is (What it is, what it is, what it is)
It is, it is (What it is, what it is, what it is)
[Post-Chorus]
Is it that sense of wonder? (Wonder)
It hit like lightning (Lightning)
Feel that inner thunder (Thunder)
It's so inviting, yeah (Ooh-ooh)
Feel it in my bones
Oh, I've got to know
Tell m–µ what it is, it is (What it is, what it is, what it is)
It is, it is (What it is, what it is, what it is)
