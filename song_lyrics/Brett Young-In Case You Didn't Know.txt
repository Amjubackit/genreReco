[Verse 1]
I can't count the times
I almost said what's on my mind
But I didn't
And just the other day
I wrote down all the things I'd say
But I couldn't
I just couldn't
[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, I know that you've been wondering
Mm, so here goes nothing
[Chorus]
In case you didn't know
Baby, I'm crazy 'bout you
And I would be lying if I said
That I could live this life without you
Even though, I don't tell you all the time
You had my heart a long, long time ago
In case you didn't know
[Verse 3]
The way you look tonight
That second glass of wine
That did it, mm
There was something 'bout that kiss
Girl, it did me in
Got me thinking
I'm thinking
