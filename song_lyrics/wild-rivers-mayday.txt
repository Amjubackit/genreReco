Start by saying I'm a couple years too late
Not the reunion I was planning on
Now I just came to give my regards and keep my faith
Let go of your words that I've been hanging on
Oh, I've been setting fire to my bed sheets
Oh, don't you twist your tongue just to protect me
Just scream, “Mayday, we're going down"
Now I must say you've had my mind in quite the wreck
And I deceived you with false virtue
Now I am sitting like a gambler in his debt
Counting all the ways that I would hurt you
Oh, I've been setting fire to my bed sheets
Oh, don't you twist your tongue just to protect me
Just scream, “Mayday, we're going down"
