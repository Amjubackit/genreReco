[Verse 1]
This is so heavy
And it’s bringing me to my knees
I’m crying out, Lord, I need You now
To come and see about me
Why is this life so hard
Why do You seem so far
But if this cup won’t pass
Help me to stay steadfast
Let Your will be done
[Chorus]
You get the glory from this
You get the glory from this
No matter what I have to
Go through in this world
As long as You get the glory from it
You get the glory from this
You get the glory from this
No matter what I have to
Go through in this world
As long as You get the glory from it
[Verse 2]
This is my cross to bear
This is my story to tell
That no matter what I’ve gone through
I’ve been tried and came out true
So let Your will be done
