Every night I cannot help wondering
Where you at, who you with, should I have stayed?
There was a time we were like 
such a chain
Good to tell that infatuation fade
You and I
Yeah, we were such a mess
In a world of tenderness
You and I
Yeah, we made it such a mess
And there is nothing when it goes
Driving fast in the middle of the night
I take the thrill we used to share in the past
Would you care if something turned back?
You know me, it would seem like a trap
You and I
Yeah, we were such a mess
In a world of tenderness
You and I
Yeah we made it such a mess
And there is nothing when it goes
You and I
Yeah we were such a mess
In a world of tenderness
You and I
Yeah we made it such a mess
And there is nothing when it goesYou know there's nothing I could do
