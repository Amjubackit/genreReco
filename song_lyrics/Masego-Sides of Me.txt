[Intro]
*Inaudible*
[Verse 1]
Went on one date, started talkin' for a month straight
Mad consistent, I was mad resistant, to the
Friendship, when I only came for them hips
I don't stick around much, I don't stay in town much
Be about it, you ain't 'bout it, gotta go
That's what she said to me
Feel like a penitentiary, locked up
Pullin' me up
If I don't get a body, I think I'm dyin'
I think I'm 'bout to see a side of me
[Chorus]
And you ain't tryin' to see
I ain't tryna see
Those sides of me
I'm not tryna see
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
[Verse 2]
If I keep those up, know I'ma end up alone
I don't even want another ten on my phone
Way too many pretty women, leave me alone
Lock me in the studio and write me a song
