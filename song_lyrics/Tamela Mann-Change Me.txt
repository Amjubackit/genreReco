[Verse 1]
Change me, oh God
Make me more like You
Change me, oh God
Wash me through and through
Create in me a clean heart
So that I may worship You
[Verse 2]
Change me, oh God
Make me more like You
Change me, oh God
Wash me through and through
Just create in me a clean heart
So that I may worship You
I need you to...
[Chorus]
Change me 
(Jesus)
Change me 
(Like only You can, Lord)
Change me 
(Is anybody out there need the Lord to change something about you?)
Change me 
(Whatever is not like You, Lord, I want You to)
Change me 
(Do it for me, Lord)
Change me 
(Lord, I want You to)
Change me 
(Like only You can, Lord)
Change me 
(Can y'all help me say it, it's easy)
I need You to...
