[Verse 1]
Feeding on the wrath of man
Shot down, traumatic
Time haunted by the past
Long gone, dogmatic
Although the die is cast
Shot down, volcanic
But what is gone is gone and done
Look back, psychotic
No chance before this life began
[Pre-Chorus]
Staring into black light
Dominating birthright
[Chorus]
Wrath of man
Leaching through, split in two
Wrath of man
Crash into point of view
Wrath of man
Violence, inheritance
Wrath of man
Thrive upon, feeding on
Seventy-two seasons gone[Verse 2]
Feeding on the wrath of man
Shoot back, erratic
Mad seasons take their toll
New mask, chaotic
Completely lost control
Shoot back, fanatic
Wither under looming shadow cast
Slip back, narcotic
Blinded by the ashes of the past
[Pre-Chorus]
Staring into black light
Choking on the stage fright
[Chorus]
Wrath of man
Lеaching through, split in two
Wrath of man
Crash into point of view
Wrath of man
Violence, inhеritance
Wrath of man
Thrive upon, feeding on
Seventy-two seasons gone[Bridge]
Piercing through, cut in two
Polarize
Point of view crash into
Paralyze
[Verse 3]
Feeding on the wrath of man
Man down, barbaric
Quick fire machine gun thoughts
Deep seed, stigmatic
Some have and some have not
Man down, demonic
No mercy from the ghost within
Turn back, hypnotic
There's breathing out, but not back in
[Pre-Chorus]
Staring into black light
Permanently midnight
[Chorus]
Wrath of man
Leaching through, split in two
Wrath of man
Crash into point of view
Wrath of man
Violence, inheritance
Wrath of man
Thrive upon, feeding on
Seventy-two seasons gone[Outro]
Feeding on the wrath of man
