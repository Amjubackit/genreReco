[Verse 1]
Home
A distant shore awaiting me, home
A city that You're building, home
I know Your love is leading me home
Home
Where we'll lay aside our weeping, home
Where the air is thick with glory, home
This is where is my heart is aching to go
[Chorus]
Home
Home
Home
Home
[Verse 2]
Home
I know one day You're calling me home
Find me watchin', find me ready to go
To the Father and the wedding
A joyous celebrating
How good it is to finally come homе
[Chorus]
To finally come home
Can't wait to finally come homе
Can't wait to finally come home
