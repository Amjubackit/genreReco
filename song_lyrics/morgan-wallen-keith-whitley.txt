[Verse 1]
I'm no stranger to the rain
It starts rainin', I start pourin'
I'll take hurt like hell in the mornin'
Over feelin' this way
There ain't a mirror in this house anymore
'Cause it kills me to see the guy that let you leave
And walk right out the door
[Pre-Chorus]
Kentucky Bluebird, Kentucky bourbon
Sure got this ol' boy hurtin' in Tennessee
[Chorus]
Good whiskey
Girl, it just don't last when Keith Whitley
Keeps bringin' you up like that
Gets me drinkin' 'bout us and what it was
The things I love got a way of gettin' gone too soon
Kinda like good whiskey, Keith Whitley and you
[Verse 2]
I hate the way you said nothin' at all
I guess you said what you had to say
But what's killin' me tonight
Is when he's lovin' on you, baby, you don't close your eyes
