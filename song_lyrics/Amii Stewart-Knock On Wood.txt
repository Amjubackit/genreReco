[Verse 1]
I don't want to lose you, this good thing
That I got 'cause if I do
I will surely, surely lose a lot
'Cause your love is better
Than any love I know
[Chorus]
It's like thunder, lightning
The way you love me is frightening
You better knock, knock on wood, baby
Ooh, baby, ooh
[Verse 2]
Yes, I'm not superstitious about ya
But I can't take no chance
I got me spinnin', baby
You know that I'm in a trance
'Cause your love is better
Than any love I know
[Chorus]
It's like thunder, lightning
The way you love me is frightening
You better knock, knock, knock on wood, baby
Ooh, baby, ooh
