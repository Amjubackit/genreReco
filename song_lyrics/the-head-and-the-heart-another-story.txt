[Verse 1]
These are just flames
Burning in your fireplace
I hear your voice and it seems
As if it was all a dream
I wish it was all a dream
[Verse 2]
I see a world
A world turning in on itself
Are we just like
Hungry wolves howling in the night?
I don't want no music tonight
[Pre-Chorus]
Can we go on like it once was?
[Chorus]
Every time I hear another story
Oh the poor boy lost his head
Everybody feels a little crazy
But we go on living with it
Yeah, they go on living with it
[Verse 1]
These are just flames
Burning in your fireplace
I hear your voice and it seems
As if it was all a dream
I wish it was all a dream
[Pre-Chorus]
Can we go on like it once was?
Can we go on like it once was?
[Chorus]
Every time I hear another story
Oh the poor boy lost his head
Everybody feels a little crazy
But we go on living with it
Yeah, they go on living with it
[Bridge]
I'll tell you one thing
We ain't gonna change much
The sun still rises
Even with the pain
I'll tell you one thing
We ain't gonna change love
The sun still rises
Even through the rain
[Refrain]
Can we go on like it once was?
Can we go on like it once was?
Everybody feels a little crazy
Can we go on like it once was?
Everybody feels a little crazy
Can we go on like it once was?
[Outro]
Can we go on like it once was?
