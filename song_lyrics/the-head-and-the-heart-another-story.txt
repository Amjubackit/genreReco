[Verse 1]
These are just flames
Burning in your fireplace
I hear your voice and it seems
As if it was all a dream
I wish it was all a dream
[Verse 2]
I see a world
A world turning in on itself
Are we just like
Hungry wolves howling in the night?
I don't want no music tonight
[Pre-Chorus]
Can we go on like it once was?
[Chorus]
Every time I hear another story
Oh the poor boy lost his head
Everybody feels a little crazy
But we go on living with it
Yeah, they go on living with it
[Verse 1]
These are just flames
Burning in your fireplace
I hear your voice and it seems
As if it was all a dream
I wish it was all a dream
