[Verse 1]
Oh, I can feel redemption on the wind
Forgiveness like the tide rolling in
Taking up the space where shame has lived
Receiving all that You died to give
[Chorus]
Let the wind blow, let the tide roll
'Til the earth knows You're a God of love
Let my dry bones sing a new song
All the glory to the God of love
Hey
[Verse 2]
Oh, I can see a valley of dry bones
Rattling, moving bone to bone
You breathe a breath of life into our lungs, yeah, woo
Marching on our knees, we march to love
[Chorus]
Let the wind blow, let the tide roll
'Til the earth knows You're a God of love
Let my dry bones sing a new song
All the glory to the God of love
Hey[Bridge]
Revival's in the air (Hey)
Oh, catch it if you can
He's moving on the wind
The dawn is breaking
Oh, lift your eyes to see
He's better than you dreamed
And everything you lost
Love's returning
Revival's in the air (Hey)
Oh, catch it if you can
He's moving on the wind
The dawn is breaking
Oh, lift your eyes to see
He's better than you dreamed
And everything you lost
Love's returning, hey
[Chorus]
Let the wind blow, let the tide roll
'Til the earth knows You're a God of love
Let my dry bones (Hey) sing a new song
All the glory to the God of love
[Bridge]
Revival's in the air
Oh, catch it if you can
He's moving on the wind
The dawn is breaking
Oh, lift your eyes to see
He's better than you dreamed
And everything you lost
Love's returning
Love's returning
Love's returning
Love's returning
(
Love's returning
)
Let the wind blow
Let's sing revival
Revival's in the air
Oh, catch it if you can
He's moving on the wind
The dawn is breaking
Oh, lift your eyes to see
He's better than you dreamed
And everything you lost
Love's returning, woo[Outro]
Let the wind blow, let the tide roll
'Til the earth knows You're a God of love
Let my dry bones sing a new song
All the glory to the God of love
All the glory to the God of love 
(Yeah)
All the glory to the God of love
