[Verse 1]
I'm a dumb teen boy
I eat sticks and rocks and mud
I don't care about the government
And I really need a hug
I feel stupid (Stupid!)
Ugly (Ugly!)
Pretend it doesn't bother me
I'm not very strong but
I'll fuck you up if you're mean to bugs
[Verse 2]
It's getting cold down here underneath the weather
I skipped class to sit with you
I really like your spotty sweater
If ladybugs are girls
How do you make kids together?
What's it like in a female world?
I bet it's just so much better
[Pre-Chorus]
I just turned fourteen
And I think this year I'm gonna be mean
[Chorus]
Don't mess with me, I'm a big boy now and I'm very scary
I punch my walls, stay out at night, and I do karate
Don't message me 'cause I won't reply, I wanna make you cry
Ain't that how it's s'posed to be? Though it isn't me
Boys will be bugs, right?
Boys will be bugs, right?
[Verse 3]
I'm a dumb teen boy
All I wanna do is quit
My mum told me that she's worried
And I couldn't give a shit
I have friends who understand me
Their names are spider, beetle, bee
They don't say much but
They have always listened to me
[Verse 4]
The other boys at school
Think it's cool to hate your parents
But they're lying all the time
The bugs advised that I should let 'em
And if you wanna cry
Make sure that they never see it
Or even better yet
Block it out and never feel it
[Pre-Chorus]
I just turned fourteen
And I think I know everything
[Chorus]
Don't mess with me, I'm a big boy now and I'm very scary
I punch my walls, stay out at night, and I do karate
Don't message me 'cause I won't reply, I wanna make you cry
Ain't that how it's s'posed to be? Though it isn't me
Boys will be bugs, right?
Boys will be bugs, right?
[Bridge]
Just turned fourteen
And I think this year I'm gonna be mean
(Just turned fourteen)
(And I think I know everything)
Just turned fourteen
And I think this year I'm gonna be mean
(Just turned fourteen)
(And I think the world revolves around me)
[Chorus]
Don't mess with me, I'm a big boy now and I'm very scary
I punch my walls, stay out at night, and I do karate
Don't message me 'cause I won't reply, I wanna make you cry
Ain't that how it's s'posed to be? Though it isn't me
Boys will be bugs, right?
Don't mess with me, I'm a big boy now and I'm very scary
I punch my walls, stay out at night, and I do karate
Don't message me 'cause I won't reply, I wanna make you cry
Ain't that how it's s'posed to be? Though it isn't me
Boys will be bugs, right?
[Outro]
Don't mess with me, I'm a big boy now and I'm very scary
I punch my walls, stay out at night, and I do karate
Don't message me 'cause I won't reply, I wanna make you cry
Ain't that how it's s'posed to be? Though it isn't me
Boys will be bugs, right?
