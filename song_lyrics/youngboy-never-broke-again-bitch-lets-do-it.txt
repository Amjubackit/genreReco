[Chorus]
It's early noon and I'm druggin', tryna fuck me somethin'
Get one to pull up on me and I'm gon' do me somethin'
Since I was sixteen, had money, I say, "I grew up stuntin'"
They hatin', they laugh, it ain't nothin' 'cause I'm gon' burn me somethin'
Now, you could think I'm stuntin', I put that on my mama
I say, I stay up in somethin', that's why we stay with them choppers
I know them slimes totin' somethin' and they be all with that drama
They pull up, jump, I start bustin' and make a bitch quit that talkin'
[Verse]
I hop out first with that chopper, I bust first at them cowards
I had some beef with some niggas, I straight fucked over they partners
I made shit sеize through the city and I sent blitz with thеm dollars
And I was the first to drop hits, bitch, I went crazy with bodies
And I was fucked up with Ten, wear the same clothes, that's my partner
He broke the code and I zipped him, this nigga used to be on side me
I was mad at my boy, but, shit, I'm grown, you can't stop me
He got me hooked on that boy, we both was goin' through some problems
Young nigga cutthroat, you saw it, he either slime or a goblin
You know I'm with it, YoungBoy, I kill that bitch 'front his mama
Like, thirty days straight, I ain't sleep from two to three
Like, thirty days straight—
Hold on, let me catch again
I say, thirty days straight, I ain't sleep from two to three
I went thirty days straight, I was rollin' off the bean
It been thirty days straight she had an attitude with me
I'ma get that ass straight, I'll stab that pussy 'til it bleed
In a new 38 chain, I got that bitch on her knees
Buy lil' baby anything and she ain't gotta ask me please
I'ma kill a pussy nigga, fuck your boy and what you bleed
I want your face on top the pavement 'bout that fuckin' playin' with me
I had your mama at the precinct every day to tell on me
That rap boy, he ain't safe, haha, bitch, please
They patch him up, couldn't even stitch him from that hole left with that heat
Spoke on us, I gotta see, get his last rollout on a tee
It ain't no bitch that I need, I need Visine
I be grindin' and she on side me
And she can't love me 'cause I'm too slimey
I'm wherever them diggers be, you know right where to find me
Though they got me fucked up, I came up, don't care 'bout nothin'
I'ma get 'em bust up, he fucked up, don't tell me nothin'
I'ma get your head bust, lil' nigga, all that fuckin' stuntin'
They gon' lay his head on the pillow if we creep up on him
Baby, I'm too yeah on these niggas, I got plenty money
Bae, I leave shit dead, industry just don't like me for nothin'
Gettin' at all they ass with this money, tell 'em, "Do me somethin'"
Bitch, I got that sack, and on your head, I'll put it on you
Ring around the rosie, my diamonds are frozen
My wife, yeah, she love me, my ex bitch ain't want me
Uh, none of them ain't wrote me, I was locked away like they threw the key
Pray at night for my soul to keep, these pussy niggas wan' roll on me[Chorus]
It's early noon and I'm druggin', tryna fuck me somethin'
Get one to pull up on me and I'm gon' do me somethin'
Since I was sixteen, had money, I say, "I grew up stuntin'"
They hatin', they laugh, it ain't nothin' 'cause I'm gon' burn me somethin'
Now, you could think I'm stuntin', I put that on my mama
I say, I stay up in somethin', that's why we stay with them choppers
I know them slimes totin' somethin' and they be all with that drama
They pull up, jump, I start bustin' and make a bitch quit that talkin'
