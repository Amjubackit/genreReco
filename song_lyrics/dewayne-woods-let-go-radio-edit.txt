I couldn't seem to fall asleep
There was so much on my mind
Searching for that peace
But the peace I could not find
So then I kneeled down to pray
Praying help me please
But then he said you don't have to cry
'Cause I'll supply all your needs
As soon as I stop worrying
Worrying how the story ends
I let go and I let God
Let God have His way
That's when things start happening
When I stopped looking at back then
I let go and I let God
Let God have his way
There's so much going on
Sometimes I can't find my way
And often times I struggle
Struggle from day to day
I have to realize that it's not my battle
It's not my battle to fight
I have to know if I put it in your hands
That everything will be alrightAs soon as I stop worrying
Worrying how the story ends
I let go and I let God
Let God have His way
That's when things start happening
I stopped looking at back then
I let go and I let God have his way
Let God have his way
Let go, let God
Let go, and let God
Let go, let God
Oh, let go and let God
Let go, and let God
My brother let go and let God
My sister you can't handle it, let God
Oh, let go and let God
Let go and let God, oh, let go and let God
He's the only one with the answers just let God
He can handle it all, yes, He can, let God
With tears in your eyes just let God
He feels your pain and he know your heart
He knows your issues, he knows your struggles
So let go and let GodSoon as, soon as I stop worrying
Worrying how the story ends
Then and only then can I
I can let go and I can let God
Let God have His way that's when, that's when
Everything will turn around, yes it will
When I stopped looking at back then
I can let go and I let God, I can let go
I can let God, oh, soon as
