[Intro]
Aah, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Aah, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Aah, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Aah, ooh, ooh, ooh
[Verse 1]
Ooh
I don't know what you still want me for
You've seen a lot but you could see some more
Window shopper, there's a lot more in store
Like how I like it every night into the day
I don't like to let the light get in the way
I'm no open book, but forget it
'Cause if you didn't get it before, you can't get it no more
[Chorus]
Don't get it before, you don't get it before
Don't get it before, you don't get it before
Don't get it before, you won't get it no more
[Post-Chorus]
Take it down for love
Take ya down for lust
[Verse 2]
You used to be the prototype when I fantasized
Now I fantasize 'bout touchin' you with open eyes
Put the indica down, am I not turnin' you on?
'Cause you're turnin' me on, yeah, you're turnin' me
You're attracted to layer number one
But will you run when the layer's undone?
You're distracted, babe, if you don't see me for me
You're not gettin' the deep, you're not gettin' me[Interlude]
'Cause, ah-ah-ah, it feels so good
Ah-ah-ah, when understood
Ah-ah-ah, turned on by the truth
Ah-ah-ah, take every side
Ah-ah-ah, it feels so right
I don't wanna fight
And I don't wanna hide
When you finally ride, ride
[Chorus]
Don't get it before, you don't get it before
Don't get it before, you don't get it before
Don't get it before, you don't get it before
You don't get it before, you don't get it before
Don't get it before, you don't get it before
Don't don't get it before, you don't get it before
Don't get it before, you don't get it before
You don't get it before, you don't get it before
[Bridge]
Won't break it down
For ya
Spelled it out
For ya
I won't just reroute
For ya
Break it down, down, down
Ooh
Aah
Ah-ah-ah[Chorus]
You don't get it before, you don't get it before
You don't get it before, you don't get it before
You don't get it before, you don't get it before
You don't get it before, you don't get it before
[Outro]
Ooh, aah, aah, ooh
Ooh, aah, aah, ooh
Ooh, aah, aah, ooh
