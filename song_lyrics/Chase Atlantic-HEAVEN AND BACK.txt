[Verse 1: Mitchel Cave]
Uh
She was always dealing with the devil
She was always into taking those chances, yeah
She said she met a couple other women who were into going late night dancing, yeah
Then she fell in love with a pill that could take away all her pain, yuh
Then she fell in love with a whole new drug that could fill her veins
And then
[Chorus: Mitchel Cave]
She's high (High)
She lives in the sky
Tonight, she's satisfied (Satisfied)
Rolling back her eyes
But then she starts to cry (To cry)
Everything is turning to black
All in one night (One night)
She just went to heaven and back (Back)
[Verse 2: Mitchel Cave]
Boiling water
Dying in an empty corner
Tied to aluminium borders
She tried, but the obsidian caught her, yeah, uh
And it might seem like she's crazy
By the things that she might say, but
While you're talking, she shoots diamorphine right into her veins
And then
