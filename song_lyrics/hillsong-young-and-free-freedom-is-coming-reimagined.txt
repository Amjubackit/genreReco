[Verse 1]
There is a promised land waiting for me
Sometimes there's an ocean that lies in between
I'll keep on traveling the path where You've been
'Til I'm right where You want me, that's where I will be
[Chorus]
Freedom is coming and it has a name
Oh, no room for my chains
Oh, You take them away
Freedom is coming and it has a name
And it is Jesus, how sweet is the name
[Verse 2]
You said it's for freedom that I was set free
Now I walk in the victory that You won for me
And if on the journey there are walls that remain
I'll sing in the promise You're making a way
[Chorus]
Freedom is coming and it has a name
Oh, no room for my chains
Oh, You take them away (Take them away)
Freedom is coming and it has a name
And it is Jesus, how sweet is the name
[Interlude]
Yeah, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
[Bridge]
One by one (One by one)
Chain by chain (Chain by chain)
Watch them fall
As we lift Your name
Strongholds break (Strongholds break)
Sin erased (Sin erased)
Washed by grace
In the power of Your name
[Chorus]
Freedom is coming and it has a name
Oh, no room for my chains
Oh, You take them away (Take them away)
Freedom is coming and it has a name
And it is Jesus, how sweet is the name
The name
Ohhh
