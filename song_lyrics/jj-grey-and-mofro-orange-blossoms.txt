Well I snuck to her window to leave her a note
Will you come meet me at the back of the grove?
All the trees were in bloom that sweet smell in the air
We were trembling together we were young we were scared
True love is hard to find
I can smell those orange blossoms
I can see her standing here
When I smell those orange blossoms then I'm there
We swam in the lake we watched fire flies by night
She was my princess and I was her knight
But her daddy didn't like me He ain't like how I look
He said leave that boy be and that's all that it took
True love is hard to find
I can smell those orange blossoms
I can see her standing here
When I smell those orange blossoms
Then I'm there
But I remember her vow How she wouldn't forget me
And all these years later I can't even remember her name
True love is hard to find
I can smell those orange blossoms
I can see her standing here
When I smell those orange blossoms
Then I'm there
Where did she go?
