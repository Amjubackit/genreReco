[Verse 1]
This sinking feeling sets
It feels just like a hole inside your chest
I know you're thinking
No, no, no, no, it is easier said than done
But please let me attest
I know it's hard
You're feeling like you're trapped
But that's how you react
When you cannot see the light
But try and see the light
I'm telling you
No, no, no, no, 
you're the only one
Standing in your way
Just take a breath, relax, and tell me
[Chorus]
Why? Please tell me why do we worry?
Why? Why do we worry at all?
Why? Just tell me why do we worry?
When worry's never helping tell me why, why worry at all?
[Verse 2]
Why do we insist
On crossing bridges that do not exist?
Let's take these issues
Step by step by step, to work it out
Day by day by day we're falling down
But life goes on
I've got some questions
Are you sick of feeling sorry?
 (Uh huh)
And people saying not to worry?
 (Uh huh)
Sick of hearing this hakuna matata motto
From people who won the lotto
We're not that lucky
Have you noticed that you're breathing?
 (Uh huh)
Look around and count your blessings (Uh huh)
So when you're sick of all this stressing and guessing
I'm suggesting you turn this up and let them hear you sing it[Chorus]
Why? Please tell me why do we worry?
Why? Why do we worry at all?
Why? Just tell me why do we worry?
When worry's never helping tell me why, why worry at all?
[Bridge]
Chin up, quit actin' like you're half dead
Tears can only half fill how youâ€™re feelin'
Don't worry, be happy baby
Stand up, life is too damn short
That clock is ticking
Man up, if ya feel me
Everybody sing it
[Chorus]
Why? Please tell me why do we worry?
Why? Why do we worry at all?
Why? Just tell me why do we worry?
When worry's never helping tell me why, why worry at all?
Why? Please tell me why do we worry?
Why? Why do we worry at all?
Why? Just tell me why do we worry?
When worry's never helping
I'm not buying what they're selling
So if worry's never helping tell me why, why worry at all?
