[Verse 1]
Every time I get away, you find a way to reel me back in, aah
Tell me that you love me, hold me tight so we can always be friends, aah
I swear, I said it before and I'll say it again! Aah
Every time I get away, you find a way to pull me back in, aah
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Why does it take so long?
Why does it feel so wrong?
Why does it take so long?
[Chorus 1]
You knew I couldn't help myself
I had to lay low
Got so high, couldn't help myself
I lost my halo
[Verse 2]
Took me by the hand and said remember all the good times we had, aah
I remember how you took my favorite knife and slipped it under my skin, aah
I swear, I said it before and I'll say it again! Aah
Every time I get away, you find a way back under my skin
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Why does it take so long?
Why does it feel so wrong?
[Chorus 2]
You knew I couldn't help myself
I had to lay low
Got so high, couldn't help myself
I lost my halo
[Outro]
All my life with a skeleton
I had to let go
Got so high, couldn't help myself
I lost my halo
I lost my halo
I lost my halo
