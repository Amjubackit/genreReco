[Verse 1]
Sunshine beating on the good times
Moonlight raising from the grave
String band playing worn out honkey-tonks
Pretty young thing going dancing in the rain
[Verse 2]
High heel lady spitting at the nickajack
Business man with a needle and a spoon
Coyote chewing on a cigarette
Pack o' young boys going howlin' at the moon
[Chorus]
Hey darlin'!
Sleeping on the blacktop
Hey darlin'!
Running through the trees honey
Hey darlin'!
Leaving for the next town
Less'n my sense catches up with me
[Verse 3]
Three dead in a crash on the number 4
Two witnesses below and up high
Not sure whose will be done
You can call me a sinner for wondering why
[Chorus]
Hey darlin'!
Sleeping on the blacktop
Hey darlin'!
Running through the trees honey
Hey darlin'!
Leaving for the next town
Less'n my sense catches up with me
[Verse 4]
Corn liquor tastes sweeter in this town
Could it be it's the same as the last?
I swear I've seen ya face elsewhere before
Just as familiar as a bottle and a glass
[Chorus X2]
Hey darlin'!
Sleeping on the blacktop
Hey darlin'!
Running through the trees honey
Hey darlin'!
Leaving for the next town
Less'n my sense catches up with me
Hey darlin'!
Sleeping on the blacktop
Hey darlin'!
Running through the trees honey
Hey darlin'!
Leaving for the next town
Less'n my sense catches up with me
Less'n my sense catches up with me
