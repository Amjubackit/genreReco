[Verse 1]
So many things I'm going through
So much that I wanna do
It's starting to become so clear to me
Tomorrow ain't really guaranteed
 (No)
So many days I've thought of you
It's about time you knew the truth
Got to act quickly, you and I
And fall in love, so many reasons why
[Chorus]
Why don't we, don't we (So why don't we)
Why don't we, why don't we (Yeah)
Why don't we fall in love (Why don't we fall in love)
It's so many reasons
It's the only thing that matters to me
Why don't we fall in love
[Verse 2]
It takes such a load off to let you know
That you're the only one, I never want to go
Things I never did, now I want to do
A love I never felt, now I feel for you, why?
Willing to swallow each and every ounce of my pride
Everything you do I wanna feel again
Ain't no use for us to pretend, why?
