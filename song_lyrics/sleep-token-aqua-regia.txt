[Verse 1]
Well, my love is an animal call
Cutting through the darkness, bouncing off the walls
Between teeth on a broken jaw
Following a blood trail, frothing at the maw
These days I'm a circuit board
Integrated hardware you cannot afford
The perfect start to a perfect war
Putting down the roses picking up the sword
[Refrain]
Aqua regia
Aqua regia
[Verse 2]
Well, my past is a holy book
A call from Olympus, ringing off the hook
Between the pain and the way you look
I'm stuck in a time where the mountains shook
And these days I'm a picture frame
Screaming at the sunshine, singing in the rain
Sugar on the blood cells, carbon on the brain
All of Eden's vices running through my veins
[Chorus]
Aqua regia
Oxytocin running in the ether
Silicon ballrooms
Subatomic interactions if it's all good
Gold rush, acid flux
Saturate me, I can't get enough
Cold love
, 
hot blood
Running to your heart when you're thinking of[Instrumental Break]
[Bridge]
Oh, when I am done dancing to alarm bells
No wonder my ears are still ringing
And I am done fighting off change
No wonder my arms are still swinging
[Chorus]
Aqua regia
Oxytocin running in the ether
Silicon ballrooms
Subatomic interactions if it's all good
Gold rush, acid flux
Saturate me, I can't get enough
Cold love, hot blood
Running to your heart when you're thinking of
