[Verse 1]
Jokers turn to Kings and diamonds to dust
I tried to beat the house but every hand was a bust
Another day ends, another begins
Another night sleeping on needles and pins
[Chorus]
I keep rolling where the bad wind blows
I keep running, but the trouble follows
Ain't no telling where I'm gonna end up
This lucky penny's been nothing but bad luck
[Refrain]
Bad luck
Bad luck
Bad luck
[Verse 2]
My rusty old rings are coming undone
Fraying at the seams every mile that I run
Another bad move, another dead stop
Another wrong turn on the way to the top
[Chorus]
I keep rolling where the bad wind blows
I keep running, but the trouble follows
Ain't no telling where I'm gonna end up
This lucky penny's been nothing but bad luck[Refrain]
Bad luck
Bad luck
[Verse 3]
I've been playing to lose and dying to win
A compassionate heart without a dollar to lend
Deep in the red between the white lines
It's a long road ahead and a long one behind
[Chorus]
I keep rolling where the bad wind blows
I keep running, but the sorrow follows
Ain't no telling where I'm gonna end up
This lucky penny's been nothing but bad luck
[Refrain]
Bad luck
Bad luck
Bad luck
Bad luck
