[Intro]
Yeah
Ooh-wee-yeah, oh yeah
[Verse 1]
I'm in a party mood
Tell me, how about you? Yeah
I'm in a party mood
I don't feel no good, well
It's been a long wild week, yeah
Down on my grind, mmm
But now that it's all over
It's party-time, yeah
I'm stepping out tonight, mmm
Where the lights are bright
Got my gin and juice, yeah
I'm gonna feel alright
I got my party clothes laid out on my bed
Tonight, I'm gonna paint the whole town red
[Verse 2]
I'm in a party mood, yeah
Tell me, how about you? Well
Somebody come out and party with me tonight
Let's make it do what it do, mm-mm
I wanna do a lil' dancing
Talk a lil' noise
I wanna flirt with the women
And jive with the boys, yeah
I wanna hear a mean DJ, yeah
Just doing his thing
I wanna order me some french fries
And some chicken wings
I wanna drink some ice cold beer
Chase with my gin
Call my mother, tell her the state that I'm in
[Verse 3]
I'm in a party mood, yeah
Tell me, how about you? Well
Somebody come party with me
Let's make it do what it do, well
I'm in a party mood
I'm stepping out tonight
Got my gin and juice, yeah
I'm gonna feel alright, well
I'm gonna roll with the dice
Wherever they fall
I might be at an upscale club tonight
Or some hole-in-the-wall
I'm gonna be sharp as a pin, there's no doubt
Some mother's daughter better look out
[Verse 4]
'Cause I'm in a party mood, yeah
Tell me, how about you? Well
Somebody come party with me
Oh, let's make it do what it do, hey, yeah
I'm in a party mood
I'm stepping out tonight
Got my gin and juice, yeah
I'm gonna feel alright
