[Intro]
I'm feelin' good (Feelin' alright tonight)
I'm feelin' good now (Yeah)
It's all good in the neighborhood, holmes, haha, yeah
Lil Rob
I feel good, I feel alright
Cruisin' through my neighborhood on a warm summer night
I feel good, that's right
I feel good now (Somethin' about these summer nights)
[Chorus]
(Woah) Summer days just sittin' around
But when the sun goes down
I'll be ready to party (Woah, hey)
Ain't nothin' like them summer nights
Keep the top on drop, all the girls lookin' hot
Hit the bolo and we just don't stop
Party until the mornin' light (Woah)
Ain't nothin' like them summer nights
[Verse 1]
I just kicked it at home, I polished up the chrome
Called the ruca on the phone, let her know I'm home alone
It's 7:30 and the sun's goin' down
It's a summer night and the fun's goin' down
I pick her up and she looks all dolled up (She look good)
Sittin' passenger in my rag Impala (Yeah)
I let her know that she looks beautiful to me
The world's an ugly place, but she is such a sight to see
The kind of woman that would put up a fight for me
The kind that wants to spend her summer nights with me
The temp was eighty and I'm cruisin' with my lady
Playin' some Ralfi Pagan, ooh, baby, baby
I see my homeboys and they're cruisin' in their ride (Hey, wassup holmes?)
With their ladies sittin' by their side
People think we look crazy, but I think we look classy
But then again, that's only if you ask me
