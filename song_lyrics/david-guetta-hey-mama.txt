You ain't ever gotta worry, I'm down for you, baby (Uh)

I'll be on deck, keep it in check
When you need that, I'ma let you have it

Beating my drum like "dum di di day"
I like the dirty rhythm you play
I wanna hear you calling my name
Like "Hey, mama, mama, hey, mama, ma"
Banging the drum like "dum di di day" (Hey)
I know you want it in the worst way
I wanna hear you calling my name
