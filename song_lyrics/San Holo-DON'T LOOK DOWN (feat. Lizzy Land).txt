[Intro]
Don’t look down
Don’t look down
[Pre-Chorus]
Don’t look
Don’t look down
Stars will shine on
After they burn out
When all of your doubts
Turn skies into clouds again
Don’t look
Don’t look down
When life gets too loud
[Chorus]
[Verse]
You’re stuck in time
As clouds go by
It gets better
Keep your head up
When life gets loud
But there’s no sound
It gets better
(Keep your head up)
