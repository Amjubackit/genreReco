People
Come together
Strange as neighbours
Our blood is one
Children of generations
Of every nation
Of kingdom come
[Chorus]
Don't let your heart be troubled
Hold your head up high
Don't fear no evil
Fix your eyes on this one truth
God is madly in love with you
Take courage
Hold on
Be strong
Remember where our help comes from
[Verse 2]

Hold your head up high
Don't fear no evil

God is madly in love with you
Take courage
Hold on
Be strong
Remember where our help comes from
