I'm a jealous man
Trying to hold on
To that good thing
No but it’s killing me inside
I'm a jealous man
Trying to hold on
To that good thing
No but it's killing me inside
Trying to let go baby
Have this curse that’s been put on me
Found a good woman
I don't wanna watch her leave
It's my inhibition darling, it's my insecurity
Driving her further, further away from me
Cause I'm a jealous man
Trying to hold on
To that good thing
No but it's killing me inside
Why would she want a man
Can't even stand on his two feet
Lord I give her all the things she needs
Now the morning passes by but
I don't want them teardrops from my eyes
No, cause she’s so far from meI’m a jealous man
Trying to hold on
To that good thing
No but it's killing me inside
Said I can’t have another
All the things my mind tells me to say
It's not that real me that feels that way
I've been hurt so many times but
Lost my trust a long time ago
But I try not to let it show
Cause I'm a jealous man
Trying to hold on
To that good thing
No but it’s killing me inside
I'm a jealous man
Trying to hold on
To that good thing
No but it's killing me inside
I'm a jealous man
Trying to hold on
To that good thing
No but it's killing me insideI'm a jealous man
Trying to hold on
To that good thing
No but it's killing me
