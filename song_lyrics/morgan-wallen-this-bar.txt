[Chorus]
I found myself in this bar
Makin' mistakes and makin’ new friends
I was growin' up and nothing made sense
Buzzin' all night like neon in the dark
I found myself in this
[Verse 1]
Couldn’t wait to turn 21
The day I did, I got too drunk
Spin around dizzy on the patio
Found out real quick how to take it slow
Got whiskey bent on whiskey sours
Ran my mouth to an out-of-towner
Learned a big lesson when I met the bouncer
[Chorus]
I found myself in this bar
Makin' mistakes and makin' new friends
I was growin' up and nothing made sense
Buzzin' all night like neon in the dark
I found myself in this bar
[Post Chorus]
Ooh-woah-ooh
Ooh-woah-ooh
Ooh-woah-ooh
I found myself in this bar
[Verse 2]
Saw her in the corner sippin' something tall
Cracked a few jokes, we hit off
Get down the road I'm watching her
Walk through the door with some new jerk
And we had it good, and it hurts so bad
But I had to stand my ground
Chased my pride with another round
[Chorus]
I found myself in this bar
Makin' mistakes and makin’ new friends
I was growin’ up and nothin' made sense
Learnin’ how to live with a broken heart
I found myself in this bar
[Post Chorus]
Ooh-woah-ooh
Ooh-woah-ooh
Ooh-woah-ooh
[Bridge]
Those nights, what I would give for one more
Bud Light, still kissin' on the front porch
Didn't even know what I was lookin' for
[Outro]
But I found myself in this bar
I found myself in this bar
I found myself in this bar
Ain’t it a stranger thing you keep tucked in your heart
I found myself in this bar
