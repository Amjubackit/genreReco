[Verse 1]
Maybe there's a fever
Burnin' on in the inside
Waiting for the demons
To come and lick the tears dry
[Pre-Chorus]
But I'm still begging for the pale sugar water
Eyes lazy for the truth
Am I still waiting like a lamb to the slaughter?
Does your god believe in you?
[Chorus]
Maybe, I'm a total wreck
So drain my blood until there's nothing left
Maybe, I wonâ€™t repent
Live a lie and let the vultures in
[Post-Chorus]
Maybe, I
(Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
(Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ahh)
Oh, make a mess of me
(Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
(Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ahh)
Mmm, make a mess of me
[Verse 2]
Maybe there's a savior
A cowboy with the right mind
Smoking from the razor
Cutting just to feel nice
[Pre-Chorus]
But I'm still begging for the pale sugar water
Eyes lazy for the truth
Am I still waiting like a lamb to the slaughter?
Does your god believe in you?
[Chorus]
Maybe, I'm a total wreck
So drain my blood until there's nothing left
Maybe, I won't repent
Live a lie and let the vultures in
[Post-Chorus]
Maybe, I
(Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
(Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ahh)
Oh, make a mess of me
(Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
(Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ahh)
Mmm, make a mess of me
[Chorus]
So maybe I'm a total wreck
So drain my blood until there's nothing left
Maybe, I won't repent
Live a lie and let the vultures in
[Post-Chorus]
Maybe, I
(Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
(Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ahh)
Oh, make a mess of me
(Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
(Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ahh)
Oh, make a mess of me
(Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
(Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ahh)
Oh, make a mess of me
(Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
(Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ahh)
Mmm, make a mess of me
