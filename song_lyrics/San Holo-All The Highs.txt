[Verse 1]
I thought about you last night
You're on repeat in my mind
Our memories on rewind
All the lows, all the highs
[Pre-Drop]
The hellos, the goodbyes
All the lows, all the highs
[Drop]
All the highs
[Verse 2]
I thought about you last night
You're on repeat in my mind
Our memories on rewind
All the lows, all the highs
I think I saw you last night
The moment I closed my eyes
Our memories on rewind
All the lows, all the highs
[Drop]
[Bridge]
All the highs (High-highs, high-highs)
All the lows, all the highs
