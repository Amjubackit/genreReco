I still have peace
I still believe
I can conquer anything
And it still by the grace of God
Still have hope
I've come through worse before
I have never walked alone
I've been kept by the grace of God
I still have peace
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
I still believe
(Still believed)
I can conquer anything
(Anything)
And it still by the grace of God
(Still have hope)
Still have hope
I've come through worse before
(Worse before)
I have never walked alone
(Never ever)
I've been kept by the grace of God
So as long a Jesus reigns
This too shall pass away
Through it all I can say that it's
(Still by the grace of God)
It's been a trying last few years
I've had to shed many tears
But I would not be standing here
No, If not for the grace of God
Don't need another clichÃ©
When you've had to deal with real pain
Is there a witness that can say?
That it's still by the grace of God
So as long a Jesus reigns
This too shall pass away
Through it all I can say that it's
(Still by the grace of God)
For every challenge you face
There's a way to escape
Don't let it take away you faith
You've come through by the grace of God
(By grace)
