[Verse 1]
She got eyes like a neon sign
Stare ya down and make ya cry
An iron will, and a thirst to kill
Ya wanna see her stuff? She gonna show ya
Her poison lips with the metal grips
She gonna pull you in and bleed ya dry
She never miss with her electric kiss
Ya think you're tough, She gonna own ya
[Pre-Chorus]
I fell for the Devil's daughter
I jump in, yeah, I drank the water
[Chorus]
Tell me doctor, can you fix my brain?
Cause everyone says I'm insane
Help me loosen this ball and chain
There's no use talking, I'm a dead man walking
I was thirsty and I wanted more
Then she burned me with the Rebels' soul
Tried to wall me in, I should have known
There's no use talking, I'm a dead man walking
[Verse 2]
She grinds you down, So you turn to dust
Say your name and tell you lies
I got past her knife, I cut ya down to size
If ya try to run, She gonna find ya
Ya never see her comin', So leave the engine runnin'
She just a criminal
She right behind ya[Pre-Chorus]
I fell for the Devil's daughter
I jump in, yeah, I drank the water
[Chorus]
(So) Tell me doctor can you fix my brain
Cause everyone says I'm insane
Help me loosen this ball and chain
There's no use talking, I'm a dead man walking
I was thirsty and I wanted more
Then she burned me with the Rebels' soul
Tried to wall me in, I should have known
There's no use talking, I'm a dead man walking
[Bridge]
So lock me up, but throw away the key
Cause I need shelter from the things I've seen
Save me from a' this lethal company
So I can breathe
[Pre-Chorus]
Ya never see her comin', so leave the engine runnin'
She just a criminal
She right behind ya
[Chorus]
(So) Tell me doctor can you fix my brain
Cause everyone says I'm insane
Help me loosen this ball and chain
There's no use talking, I'm a dead man
I was thirsty and I wanted more
Then she burned me with the Rebels' soul
Tried to wall me in, I should've known
There's no use talking, I'm a dead man walking[Ad lib Outro]
A dead man walking
Just a dead man walking
A dead man
There's no use helping, I'm a dead man
