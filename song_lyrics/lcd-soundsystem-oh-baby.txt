[Verse 1]
Oh baby
Oh baby
You're having a bad dream
Here in my arms
[Verse 2]
Oh sugar
You came to me
Could all be a bad thing
Doing you harm
Oh oh oh
[Verse 3]
Oh lover
You run from me
We move like a bad scene
Shot in the dark
[Chorus 1]
Oh, but please
Please wake me
But my love lies patiently
Please baby, please
And my love life waits for me
[Verse 4]
Oh love
You came to me
You were having a bad time
There in your home
[Verse 5]
Oh sugar
Give in to me
You're just having a bad dream
Ringing alarms
[Chorus 2]
Oh, but please
Please shake me
But my love sits patiently
Please, baby, please
And my love plays wait and see
[Verse 6]
Oh, I'm on my knees
Yeah, I'm on my knees
I promise I'm clean
But my love life waits
[Bridge]
And you're already gone
Yeah, you're already gone
You're already home
And my love life stumbles on
[Outro]
Oh baby
Lean into me
There's always a side door
Into the dark
Into the dark
