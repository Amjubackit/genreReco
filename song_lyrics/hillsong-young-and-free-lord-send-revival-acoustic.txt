Peace like a river, wash over me
Immerse me in water as deep as the sea
Hide me in love, Your healing embrace
Peace like a river, wash over me
As I worship Your majesty
I worship Your holy Name
Jesus, my everything
All that I am is Yours
Come, Holy Spirit, rain down on me
Break open the heavens and drench the unseen
Oh, pour out Your presence as I pour out Your praise
Come, Holy Spirit, Lord, have Your way
As I worship Your majesty
I worship Your holy Name
Jesus, my everything
All that I am is Yours
Open the heavens, fling wide the gates
Flood every heart with mercy
Pour out Your presence, inhabit our praise
As we cry holy, holy
Open the heavens, fling wide the gates
Flood every heart with mercy
Pour out Your presence, inhabit our praise
As we cry holy, holy
Oh, oh
As we cry holy, holy
Oh, ohLord, send revival, Lord, send it now
A move of Your Spirit, Heaven, break out
Come now in power, cover this land
Like You’ve done it before, would You do it again?
Lord, send revival, Lord, send it now
A move of Your Spirit, Heaven, break out
Come now in power, cover this land
Like You’ve done it before, would You do it again?
Oh, so do it again
Heal our heart
Heal this land
Lord, have Your way
