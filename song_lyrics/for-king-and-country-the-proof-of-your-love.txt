[Verse 1]
If I sing but don't have love
I waste my breath with every song
I bring an empty voice, a hollow noise
If I speak with a silver tongue
Convince a crowd but don't have love
I leave a bitter taste with every word I say
[Chorus]
So let my life be the proof
The proof of Your love
Let my love look like You and what You're made of
How You lived, how You died
Love is sacrifice
So let my life be the proof
The proof of Your love
[Verse 2]
If I give to a needy soul
But don't have love then who is poor?
It seems all the poverty is found in me
[Chorus]
So let my life be the proof
The proof of Your love
Let my love look like You and what You're made of
How You lived, how You died
Love is sacrifice
Oh, let my life be the proof
The proof of Your love
[Bridge]
When it's all said and done
When we sing our final song
Only love remains
Only love remains
[Interlude]
[Chorus]
Let my life be the proof
The proof of Your love
Let my love look like You and what You're made of
How You lived, how You died
Love is sacrifice
So let my life be the proof
The proof of Your love
