[Intro: Justin]
(
It's gonna be me
)
Ooh yeah
[Verse 1: Justin, 
Justin & Chris
]
You might've been hurt, babe
That ain't no lie
You've seen them all come and go
Oh-oh
I remember you told me
That it made you believe in “no man, no cry”
Maybe that's why
[Chorus: All]
Every little thing I do
Never seems enough for you
You don't wanna lose it again
But I'm not like them
Baby, when you finally
Get to love somebody
Guess what?
It's gonna be me
[Verse 2: JC, 
JC & Chris
, 
Justin
]
You've got no choice, babe
But to move on, you know
There ain't no time to waste
But you're just
Too blind (too blind)
To see
But in the end, you know it's gonna be me
You can't deny
So just tell me
 why[Chorus: All, 
Justin
, 
JC
]
Every little thing I do
Never seems enough for you
You don't wanna lose it again
But I'm not like them
Baby, when you final
ly
Get to love somebody (
Somebody

Guess what?
It's gonna be me
[Interlude: Justin]
(
