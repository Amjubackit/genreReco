[Verse]
Oh brother, where are you?
I think I need a hand
Can you come pick me up?
Don't know where I am
Bet I can tell it's not
Where I want to be
Oh brother, help me out
Keep your eye on me
[Chorus]
Don't let me go somewhere
I can't find my way back home
Don't let me go
Don't let me go somewhere
I can't find my way back home
Don't let me go
Don't let me go somewhere
I can't find my way back home
Don't let me go
Don't let me, don't let me
Don't let me, don't let me go[Verse]
Don't let me let myself
Lose my way
I can't quite trust my feet
To keep me walking straight
Baby I should be stronger now
But I can tell I'm not
So brother, walk with me
Think I'll walk right out
[Chorus]
Don't let me go somewhere
I can't find my way back home
Don't let me go
Don't let me go somewhere
I can't find my way back home
Don't let me go
I said, don't let me go somewhere
I can't find my way back home
Don't let me go
Don't let me, don't let me
Don't let me, don't let me go[Verse]
Don't let me fool myself
As I often do
If you watch over me
I'll watch over you
I won't let you go somewhere
You can't find your way back
I won't let you go
[Chorus]
So don't let me go somewhere
I can't find my way back home
Don't let me go
I said, don't let me go somewhere
I can't find my way back home
Don't let me go
Don't let me, don't let me
Don't let me, don't let me go
