[Verse 1]
Maybe in another life
I could find you there
Pulled away before your time
I can't deal, it's so unfair
[Chorus]
And it feels, and it feels like
Heaven is so far away
And it feels, yeah, it feels like
The world has grown cold
Now that you've gone away
[Verse 2]
Leavin' flowers on your grave
To show that I still care
Black roses and "Hail Mary's"
Can't bring back what's taken from me
[Pre-Chorus]
I reach to the sky and call out your name
And if I could trade, I would
[Chorus]
And it feels, and it feels like
Heaven is so far away
And it stings, yeah, it stings, now
The world is so cold
Now that you've gone away[Post-Chorus]
Gone away, gone away
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah ooh
Yeah ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, oh yeah
[Bridge]
I'll save your soul, woah
Yeah, yeah, ooh
[Pre-Chorus]
I reach to the sky and call out your name
Oh, please let me trade, I would
[Chorus]
And it feels, and it feels like
Heaven is so far away
And it feels, yeah, it feels like
The world has grown cold
Now that you've gone away
[Post-Chorus]
Gone away, gone away
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah ooh
Yeah ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, oh yeah
Yeah ooh, yeah ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, oh yeah
