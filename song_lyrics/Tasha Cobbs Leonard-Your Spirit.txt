[Intro]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
[Chorus]
Not by might, not by power
By Your spirit, God
Send Your spirit, God
Not by might, not by power
By Your spirit, God
Send Your spirit, God
[Verse 1]
You are the fire, we are the temple
Your are the voice, we are Your song
You are our God, we are Your people
You are the light, we stand in awe
[Pre-Chorus]
We stand in awe of You
We stand in awe of You
[Chorus]
Not by might, not by power
By Your spirit, God
Send Your spirit, God
Not by might, not by power
By Your spirit, God
Send Your spirit, God
