[Verse 1: Jorja Smith & 
Brent Faiyaz
]
I've heard it all
Our conversations got me feelin’ I'm the fool
Like I should've listened when they said that you
Would treat me like you did, oh, yeah
Said I did it all
Situation makes me feel I’m not a man at all
Swore I'd be there, swore that I'd catch your fall
I guess I couldn't handle it, no
[Pre-Chorus: Brent Faiyaz]
And I know you probably thinkin' I ain't worth shit
But I'd never want anyone to bring you any harm
And I'd take it all back just to have you in my arms
And I know for a fact who we were ain’t who we are
We are
[Chorus: Jorja Smith & 
Brent Faiyaz
]
Don’t think you cared about me
Oh, girl, I care about you
But you don't care ’bout nobody
Nobody but you
Don't think you cared about me
Oh, girl, I carе about you
But you don't care 'bout nobody
Nobody but you[Verse 2: Brent Faiyaz & 
Jorja Smith
]
I wish I had the time to run to you, not ruin your lifе
I’d never wrong you twice, I wanna make things right
And maybe, you'll take me
Hope you don't hate me
Don't want to fight anymore
Daytimes are silent as hell
I wish that I could ignore all that you said
If you can't find the time or space
Then I don't have the words to say
I wonder if the only peace we'll find
Gonna be when you tell me, "Goodbye"?
[Pre-Chorus: Brent Faiyaz]
And I know you probably thinkin' I ain't worth shit
But I'd never want anyone to bring you any harm
And I'd take it all back just to have you in my arms
And I know for a fact who we were ain't who we are
We are
[Chorus: Jorja Smith & 
Brent Faiyaz
]
Don't think you cared about me
Oh, girl, I care about you
But you don't care 'bout nobody
Nobody but you
Don't think you cared about me
Oh, girl, I care about you
But you don't care 'bout nobody
Nobody but you
