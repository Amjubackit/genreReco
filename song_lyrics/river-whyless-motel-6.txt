[Verse 1]
Long time lover have you gone
I left you walking through the parking lot of a Motel 6
As I turned our van back east
Somewhere on the road we lost our way
[Pre-Chorus 1]
In my mind
In my mind
I can save us all
I can breathe it all back to life
In my mind
In my mind
[Chorus]
I've spent my whole life moving
I've spent my whole life on a road
From a dream I'm waking up
And for the first time
I'm terrified of waking up alone
[Verse 2]
Within the shade of my delusion
I drive into the night
I drive into a lie that I deemed worth living all my life
In my hands a child is dying
