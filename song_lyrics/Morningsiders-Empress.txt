[Verse 1]
Lady
There’s a price to pay
And lady
It's running through my veins
Lady
Why won’t you look at me?
Lady
What else is there to see?
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, it’s all coming back
Dawn is when I see best
[Chorus]
Because I was a fool for loving her over you
And if I fall I really hope you’ll call me 'cause I’m not over you
[Verse 2]
Lady
Can’t always get your way
Lady
Can’t just do as you may
Lady
Why won’t you look at me?
'Cause lady
What else is there to see?
