[Verse 1]
I moved from New York, with my boogie board
And bought a big house on the ocean
I stopped eatin' meat
, I took the shoes off my feet
Just because I took a notion
My hair gave in, so my beard came out
Caused quite a facial commotion
It grew past my lips and then it covered my mouth
So no one could read my emotions
[Chorus]
Malibu man, isn't life grand?
Got the world in his hands
Malibu man
[Verse 2]
Sometimes I get up, but I'm feeling down
I don't have a sister or brother
No family, no wife, but I'm still livin' the life
Just step from a stone to another
I'm a myth of man, I ride the waves when I can
I make the music so people will buy it
I take pride in my ways, and my colossal paydays
I'm just an old-fashioned retailers' riot
[Chorus]
Malibu man, isn't life grand?
Got the world in his hands
Malibu man
Malibu man, isn't life grand?
Got the world in his hands
Malibu man[Outro]
Give it up, give it up
Malibu man
Give it up, give it up
Malibu
Give it up, give it up
Malibu man
Give it up, give it up
Malibu
Give it up, give it up
Malibu man
Give it up, give it up
Malibu
Give it up, give it up
Malibu man
Give it up, give it up
