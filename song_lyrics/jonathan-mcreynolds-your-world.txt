[Intro]
This is Your world
I'm just livin' in it
[Verse 1]
The lillies ain't worried 'bout it
And the birds ain't chirpin' 'bout it
And You've done more for me than You've done for the trees
So, why would I even doubt it?
If the rocks on the ground can say it
And the sky full of clouds can paint it
Who am I to be here complainin'?
Only thinking 'bout what I would change, yeah
[Chorus]
This is Your world, uh
I'm just livin' in it, ayy
I'm just walkin' through it
Knowin' that You're with me, ooh
This is Your world
I'm just livin' in it, yeah, hey
I'm just prayin' through it, mm
Knowin' that You listen
[Post-Chorus]
Hold up
Every single one of my own plans
See, I'd rather have Your heart
So I'll put 'em in Your hands
Mm
This is Your world
I-I'm just livin' in it
[Interlude]
He's got the whole world in His hands
He's got the whole world in His hands
[Verse 2]
The world hasn't stopped turnin'
And the sun hasn't stopped burnin'
You make the universe expand just because You can
But I know You're more concerned about me, yeah
Worry can't add another minute to my life, mm
Before I started, You charted out the finish line
[Chorus]
Hey, this is Your world, uh
I'm just livin' in it
I'm just walkin' through it, uh
Knowin' that You're with me, oh
This is Your world, hey
I'm just livin' in it, uh
I'm just prayin' through it, hey
Knowin' that You listen
[Post-Chorus]
Hold up
Every single one of my own plans
See, I'd rather have Your heart
So I'll put 'em in Your hands
(Hold up) Hold up
Every single one of my own plans (Oh)
See, I'd rather have Your heart
So I'll put 'em in Your hands
(Oh, hold up) Hold up
Every single one of my own plans (Own plans)
See, I'd rather have Your heart (Your heart)
So I'll put 'em in Your hands
(Oh, hold up) Hold up
Every single one of my own plans (Every single one of my own plans)
See, I'd rather have Your heart
So I'll put 'em in Your hands (Oh)
[Outro]
This is Your world
I'm just livin' in it
He's got the whole world in His hands
He's got the whole world in His hands
