[Verse 1]
Sulfur on your breath
Granite in my chest
You won't ever have to talk about it
You'll never wanna talk about it
Fury too damn late
Reason dislocates
And you'll never have to talk about it
You'll never wanna talk about it
[Chorus]
I was more than just a body in your passenger seat
And you were more than just somebody I was destined to meet
I see you go half-blind when you're looking at me
But I am
Between the second-hand smoke and the glass on the street
You gave me nothing whatsoever but a reason to leave
You say you want mе, but you know I'm not what you need
But I am
[Verse 2]
When you'd sit there acting likе you know me
Acting like you only brought me here to get below me
Never mind the death threats, parting at the door
We'd rather be six feet under than be lonely
And if you had a problem, then you should have told me
'Fore you started getting all aggressive and controlling
You only drink the water when you think it's holy
So keep an eye on the road or we will both be here forever
[Chorus]
I was more than just a body in your passenger seat
And you were more than just somebody I was destined to meet
I see you go half-blind when you're looking at me
But I am
Between the second-hand smoke and the glass on the street
You gave me nothing whatsoever but a reason to leave
You say you want me, but you know I'm not what you need
But I am
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
I was more than just a body in your passenger seat
And you were more than just somebody I was destined to meet
I see you go half-blind when you're looking at me
But I am
Between the second-hand smoke and the glass on the street
You gave me nothing whatsoever but a reason to leave
You say you want me, but you know I'm not what you need
But I am
