[Verse 1]
Define your meanin' of war
To me it's what we do when we're bored
I feel the heat comin' off of the blacktop
And it makes me want it more
Because I'm hyped up, out of control
If it's a fight, I'm ready to go
I wouldn't put my money on the other guy
If you know what I know that I know
[Chorus]
It's been a long time comin'
And the tables turned around
'Cause one of us is goin'
One of us is goin' down
I'm not runnin'
It's a little different now
'Cause one of us is goin'
One of us is goin' down
[Verse 2]
Define your meanin' of fun
Is it fuckin', druggin' or guns?
I feel the heat comin' off of the blacktop
So get ready for another one
Let's take a trip down memory lane
The words circlin' in my brain
You can treat this like another all the same
But don't cry like a bitch when you feel the pain
