[Chorus: Young Nudy]
I'm from the five, middle finger, Zone 6
Dirty land, dirty sticks
Bad bitches gettin' hit
Put a nigga on a lick
Rob a nigga for a brick
Rob a nigga for his shit
Young nigga fall off, turn into a snitch
Never turn into a bitch
Gotta keep it cool, homie, rob his ass quick
Never fallin' off, do a nigga bad, rob him for his stash (Do that)
Nigga talkin' like he a real gangster, put that stick on his ass (Yeah, shoot that)
