[Verse 1]
Some days I'm lonely
And some days I'm not
Some days I am only
A little bit sad, not a lot
[Pre-Chorus]
How do you
How do you make a home?
What to do?
'Cause I never stay too long
[Chorus]
Every house looks the same in my dreams
Every house feels like home for a couple weeks
I've been runnin' 'round trying to find a
Place where I can breathe
But me oh my
I found you under an April sky
And you feel like
City life, apple pie baked just right
Home is wherever you are tonight
[Verse 2]
Some days feel empty
Some days feel whole
Someday we can be in the same city
Someday we'll be grown and I'll be
Fine with packing up
Cardboard boxes filled and sad farewells
And I'll be fine with that goodbye
As long as I don't say goodbye to you as well
[Chorus]
'Cause every house looks the same in my dreams
Every house feels like home for a couple weeks
I’ve been runnin' 'round trying to find a
Place where I can breathe
But me oh my
I found you under an April sky
And you feel like
City life, apple pie baked just right
Home is wherever you are tonight
[Bridge]
Let's rent a place
Two rooms and a window facing
Buildings and fire escapes
Might be no AC
A little bit cramped
But see if I'm with you, it's okay
(Mmmmm)
[Outro]
Me oh my
I found you under an April sky
And you feel like
City life, apple pie baked just right
Home is wherever you are tonight
