When you came in, the air went out
And every shadow filled up with doubt
I don't know who you think you are
But before the night is through
I wanna do bad things with you
I'm the kind to sit up in his room
Heart sick and eyes filled up with blue
I don't know what you've done to me
But I know this much is true:
I wanna do bad things with you
Ok...
When you came in, the air went out
And all those shadows there, didn't leave any doubt
I don't know who you think you are
But before the night is through
I wanna do bad things with you
I wanna do real bad things with you
(howl)
I don't know what you've done to me
But I know this one thing is true:
I wanna do bad things with you
I wanna do real bad things with you
