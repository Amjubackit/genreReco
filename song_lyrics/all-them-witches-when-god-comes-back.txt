[Verse 1]
Cut me up, primitive, I'll die like a slave
Riding on the wings of that Jesus snake
[Verse 2]
Ten thousand souls in your right hand
Never lost ground to no cold-blooded man
[Verse 3]
Ten thousand souls in your right hand
Juggernaut child in a fragile land
[Bridge]
Everything I see is just a part of it
Every word I breathe is just a part of it
I saw her drink from that cup of light
So I know she still exists
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 4]
Cut me up, primitive, I'll die like a slave
Riding on the wings of that Jesus snake
