Where were you when the saw mill burned?
I was out fighting with my grandpa's gun
They can follow me as best they can
But I can run quicker when there is no sun
Shine on
Shine on
Shine on
Shine on
Yeah the government of this state
Ain't the only way that the sherrif gets paid
You can try to hide who you are
But they'll see straight through your charade
Shine on
Shine on
Shine on
Shine on
Where do the hound dogs eat
When the people are frail?
Where does the smoke from your lungs go
Once you exhale?
What do the cockroaches do
With no one 'round?
They live like the moonshiners
Half undergroundYes it was me that burned it down
To confound everyone and make it well known
That after 33 years of this
I've got a government of my own
Shine on
Shine on
Shine on
Shine on
Where do the hound dogs eat
When the people are frail?
Where does the smoke from your lungs go
Once you exhale?
What do the cockroaches do
With no one 'round?
They live like the moonshiners
Half underground
