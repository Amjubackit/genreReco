In the cool of the evening
When everything is getting kind of groovy
You call me up and ask me
Would i like to go with you and see a movie?
First i say no, I've got some plans for tonight
But then i stop and say all right
Love is kind of crazy with a spooky little boy like you
Love is kind of crazy with a spooky little boy like you
Spooky
You always keep me guessing, I never seem to know what you are thinking
And if a girl looks at you, it’s for sure your little eye will be a-winking
I get confused, i never know where i stand
But then you smile and hold my hand
Love is kind of crazy with a spooky little boy like you
Love is kind of crazy with a spooky little boy like you
Spooky
Love is kind of crazy with a spooky little boy like you
Love is kind of crazy with a spooky little boy like you
Spooky
If you decide some day to stop this little game that you are playing
I'm gonna tell you all the things my heart's been dying to be saying
Just like a ghost you’ve been haunting my dreams, but now i know, you're not what you seem
Love is kind of crazy with a spooky little boy like you
