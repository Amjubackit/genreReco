DJ Skrillex, we be the realest team, I'm the illest
Watch how I kill it, watch how I spit it
On the mic, feel it
Y'all can't do what I do, just admit it (Mmm)
I'm 'bout to get it, money, money get it
Drop it to the floor, shake my big biddies
Bop it like Diddy, my face look pretty
Y'all ain't doin' shit new, I done did it
'Cause I'm marvelous, fantabulous
A bad chick, the flow's sick, like oh shit
You know this, I'm too fit to ever quit
Knockin' these fools out like pool sticks
I do this, I move this, I proved this
Bars be hard like a pound of bricks
