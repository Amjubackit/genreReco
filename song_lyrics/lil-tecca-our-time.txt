[Intro]
(
Jayron made that right
)
[Verse 1]
I don't know what's goin' on
I'm gettin' to the racks, now that nigga call me "Bro" (Nigga call me "Bro")
Now they pull up to my show (Now they pull up to my show)
I'm just doin' me, they comparin' all my flows (They comparin' all my flows)
And they don't even know (And they don't even know)
And you don't even know, and we don't even know
I just know I'm 'bout to blow, I just know I'm 'bout to glow
[Chorus]
Shout out to my nigga Vell (Yeah), yeah, you know he from the North
Got your bitch, she on my body and she suckin' me on soft
Why these niggas talkin' hot? Boy, you know that you ain't tough
Nigga, I ain't gon' lie, got me really fucked up
Really fucked up, really fucked up
Really fucked up, got me really fucked up
Really fucked up, really fucked up
Really fucked up, got me really fucked up (Brrt)
[Verse 2]
I swear, I don't fuck with these niggas (Nah)
I'm tired of actin' like I fuck with these niggas (Nah)
It's like as they get faker, I get bigger (Nah)
Sometimes I don't even wanna get bigger
I remember when I didn't look in the mirror
Now I see I'm the man when I look in the mirror (Oh, I'm the man)
Are you really that man that you see in the mirror?
Is that really your gang? Did they help you get here? (Help you get here)
And the fit gon' drip, it don't mat' what I wear
I could wear a Nike sweatsuit with a Moncler (Moncler)
And it's gon' be angelic as long as I'm here
They say, "Lil Tecca, what style in your hair?" ("What style in your hair?")[Bridge]
And now shawty on my body, I don't even want her (Want her)
Real cold outside, I ain't even gon' burr (Fuck that, gon' burr)
Found out that some niggas, they be using me for clout, yeah
Pull up on your block, all my niggas gon' skrrt
[Chorus]
Shout out to my nigga Vell (Yeah), yeah, you know he from the North
Got your bitch, she on my body and she suckin' me on soft
Why these niggas talkin' hot? Boy, you know that you ain't tough
Nigga, I ain't gon' lie, got me really fucked up
Really fucked up, really fucked up
Really fucked up, got me really fucked up
Really fucked up, really fucked up
Really fucked up, got me really fucked up
