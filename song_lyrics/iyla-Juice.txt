I wasn’t looking for you when you came along
When you came in
Where did you come from like… 
out the sky into my life now
I wish I could say you were my first love
I wish I could say I wouldn’t hurt you
Cuz baby I want it better or worse
You could have my love forever you earned it
I just get down with you
Love what I found, won’t mess around
Whatever we get into
We got the vibe, we got the juice baby
Ooh that’s how we do
Cuz I wasn’t looking for love
Ooh, yeah
I wasn’t looking for love
Oh no, you might be the one
Oh no, no, no, where did you come from?
You just dropped out the sky, you just fell in my lap, you just crashed in my life
Run that shit run it back
Baby, baby
Drive me crazy
Know that I want you
Got me like da da da da
