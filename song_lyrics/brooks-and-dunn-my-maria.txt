[Verse 1]
My Maria
Don't you know I've come a long, long way
I been longin' to see her when she's around
She takes my blues away
Sweet Maria
The sunlight surely hurts my eyes
I'm a lonely dreamer on a highway in the sky
[Chorus]
My Maria (
Oh, Marie, I love you girl
) (
Oh, my Maria
)
Maria (
Oh, Marie, I love you, girl
)
(
Maria
) I love you
[Verse 2]
My Maria
There were some blue and sorrow times
Just my thoughts about you bring back
My peace of mind
Gypsy lady
You're a miracle work for me
You set my soul free like a ship sailing on the sea
[Bridge]
She is the sunlight when the
Skies are grey
She treats me so right, Lady
Take me away[Chorus]
My Maria (
Oh, Marie, I love you girl
) (
Oh, my Maria

Oh, Marie, I love you, girl
