[Verse 1]
There is something on your mind
By the way you look at me
There is something on your mind, honey
By the way you look at me
[Chorus]
Can what you're thinking bring happiness
Or will it bring misery?
[Verse 2]
No, no, please don't try to tell me
I think I understand
No, no, you don't have to tell me, pretty baby
I think I understand
[Chorus]
You want me to try and forget you
But I'll do the best I can
[Verse 3]
If you ever think about me
If I ever cross your mind
Girl, girl, if you ever think about me, pretty baby
If I ever cross your mind
