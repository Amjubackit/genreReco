[Intro]
Brandon, literally anything y'all talk about you just find a way to switch it around and talk about yourself
I don't know why, but you do
Like why—? Why do you—?
You're like literally such a narcissist
[Chorus]
'Cause are you in love with him? (No, no)
She told me it's all my fault, you're wrong again (Oh)
And the truth is never told
You'll never hear from me again, please cry yourself to sleep
[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah), yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
[Verse]
I seen you like nice, you don't care to be
I've seen with my eyes, I know what you mean
And it's awful, you let me bleed
And it's awful, you're not the samе like you were
[Chorus]
'Causе are you in love with him? (No, no)
She told me it's all my fault, you're wrong again (Oh)
And the truth is never told
You'll never hear from me again, please cry yourself to sleep
[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah), yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
[Outro]
Hahahaha
Yeah
No, no, no
