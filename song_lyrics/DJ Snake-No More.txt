[Verse 1]
Ooh, I caught you lyin', lyin' to my face
Stop them tears you're cryin'
You made your bed, now lay
I don't fuck with you no more
I don't fuck with you no more
Dunno why you tryin'
Passin' on the blame
Ain't no justifyin'
It's time you take the pain
I don't fuck with you no more
I don't fuck with you no more
[Chorus]
Watch me do me
I ain't gonna hurt no more
Ain't gonna hurt no more
You cut me deep, so deep
But I ain't gonna hurt no more
Ain't gonna hurt no more, oh no
[Verse 2]
Ooh, I caught you lyin', lyin' to my face
Stop them tears you're cryin'
You made your bed, now lay
I don't fuck with you no more
I don't fuck with you no more
Dunno why you tryin'
Passin' on the blame
Ain't no justifyin'
It's time you take the pain
I don't fuck with you no more
I don't fuck with you no more
