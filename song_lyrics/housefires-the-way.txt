[Verse 1]
Through every battle
Through every heartbreak
Through every circumstance
I believe
That You are my fortress
Oh, You are my portion
And You are my hiding place, oh
[Chorus]
I believe You are
The way, the truth, the life
I believe You are
The way, the truth, the life
[Verse 2]
I believe
Through every blessing
Through every promise
Through every breath I take
I believe
That You are Provider
Oh, You are Protector
And You are the One I love, oh
[Chorus]
And I believe You are
The way, the truth, the life
I believe You are
The way, the truth, the life
I believe You are
Oh, You are
Oh, You are[Bridge]
And it's a new horizon and I'm set on You
And You meet me here today with mercies that are new
All my fears and doubts, they can all come too
Because they can't stay long when I'm here with You
It's a new horizon and I'm set on You
And You meet me here today with mercies that are new
All my fears and doubts, they can all come too
Because they can't stay long when...
[Chorus]
I believe You are
The way, the truth, the life
I believe You are
The way, the truth, the life
I believe You are...
[Bridge]
It's a new horizon and I'm set on You
And You meet me here today with mercies that are new
And all my fears and doubts, they can all come too
Because they can't stay long when...
[Chorus]
I believe You are
The way, the truth, the life
And I believe You are
The way, the truth, the life
And I believe You are[Instrumental]
