[Verse 1: Tom DeLonge]
Everything has fallen to pieces
Earth is dying, help me Jesus
We need guidance, we've been misled
Young and hostile, but not stupid
[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
Corporate leaders, politicians
Kids can't vote, adults elect them
Laws that rule the school and workplace
Signs that caution, sixteen's unsafe
[Chorus: Tom DeLonge]
We really need to see this through
We never wanted to be abused
We'll never give up, it's no use
If we're fucked up, you're to blame
[Verse 3: Tom DeLonge]
Let this train wreck burn more slowly
Kids are victims in this story
Drown our youth with useless warnings
Teenage rules, they're fucked and boring
[Chorus: Tom DeLonge]
We really need to see this through
We never wanted to be abused
We'll never give up, it's no use
If we're fucked up, you're to blame
