[Verse 1]
Standing in the street, the sun is in the east
Calling out the beast, the tiger underneath
Starting to believe, the world is at my feet
I'm ready for the feast, it's all within my reach (It's all within my reach)
[Chorus]
I'm going all the way
I'm going, yeah, my blood is rebel
I'm going all the way
I'm going to another level
To another level
To another level
[Verse 2]
If I'm on the loose, running after you
There's nothing you can do, I'll catch you and it's through
Hustle for the juice, hundred twenty proof
I'm blowing up the roof, blowing up the roof
Got nothing left to prove (Come on)
[Chorus]
I'm going all the way
I'm going, yeah, my blood is rebel
I'm going all the way
I'm going to another level
(Let's go) To another level
(Gotta get my hands dirty)
To another level
