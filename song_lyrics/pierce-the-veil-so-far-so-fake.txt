[Intro]
So far
So far, so fake
I don't wanna answer the phone, rather watch it rain
[Verse 1]
Away, take me away
Before I begin to enjoy the metallic taste
(The world is twisted)
[Chorus]
I know you wanna distance yourself from me
The head is only a dangerous dead weight
I'm cauterizing the veins you lacerate
In the end, you took it all away from me
[Verse 2]
Skin, flawless and thin
But your apologies are only selfish with vain intent
So what?
Just like brain freeze, you'll fade
Now there's a firе in the speakers
And blood on thе master tapes
(The world is twisted)
[Chorus]
I know you wanna distance yourself from me
The head is only a dangerous dead weight
I'm cauterizing the veins you lacerate
In the end, you took it all away from me
I keep it hundred in case you twist your blade
I cut you out because I don't think that I'm sick
Be still your heart, and do not resuscitate
In the end, you took it all away from me[Bridge]
These days I think are so strange
No cuts, no trust, name no names
Armless, we swim over flames
It's comin' around this time
It's comin' around this time
These days I think are so strange
No cuts, no trust, name no names
Armless, we swim over flames
It's comin' around this time
It's comin' around this time
Go
[Chorus]
I know you wanna distance yourself from me
The head is only a dangerous dead weight
I'm cauterizing the veins you lacerate
In the end, you took it all away from me
I keep it hundred in case you twist your blade
I cut you out because I don't think that I'm sick
Be still your heart, and do not resuscitate
In the end, you took it all away from me
