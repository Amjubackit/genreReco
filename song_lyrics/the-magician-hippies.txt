[Verse 1]
Like a hippie boomer with constellations
Can you read my fortune?
With darkness in your eyes until the morning
With our arms open
'Cause I can't keep falling through kaleidoscopic skies
You said trip, we can dip, follow all the yellow bricks
Take the top off your lip like it's 1966
What's your scene? Lucid dreams, kind that taste like gasoline
Told myself and don't forget me, though
[Chorus]
Oh, here we go again, it's that two-bit hippie dance
Oh, here we go again, it's that two-bit hippie dance
[Verse 2]
Like a hippie boomer with constеllations
Can you read my fortune?
With darkness in your еyes until the morning
With our arms open
'Cause I can't keep falling through kaleidoscopic skies
You said trip, we can dip, follow all the yellow bricks
Take the top off your lip like it's 1966
What's your scene? Lucid dreams, kind that taste like gasoline
Told myself and don't forget me, though[Bridge]
Oh, will you please know how to party?
Oh, will you please know how to move?
Oh, will you please know how to party?
Oh, will you please know how to move? Hey
[Chorus]
Oh, here we go again, it's that two-bit hippie dance
Oh, here we go again, it's that two-bit hippie dance
[Verse 3]
Like a hippie boomer with constellations
Can you read my fortune?
With darkness in your eyes until the morning
With our arms open
'Cause I can't keep falling through kaleidoscopic skies
You said trip, we can dip, follow all the yellow bricks
Take the top off your lip like it's 1966
What's your scene? Lucid dreams, kind that taste like gasoline
Told myself and don't forget me, though
[Chorus]
Oh, here we go again, it's that two-bit hippie dance
Oh, here we go again, it's that two-bit hippie dance
