[Verse 1]
Self medicate, while they sleep
We let the night chase evil things away
And we're like animals homesick from shows
We've gotta kill everything before the night gets wasted
Maybe it seems so strange
But we don't even stress at all
'Cause we've got poisons in our well
(Poison in our well)
[Pre-Chorus]
Come at me with everything you've got
[Chorus]
Burst into flames, scream in the dark
I'm gonna light up this place and die in beautiful stars tonight
[Verse 2]
Does it even make a difference?
When I'm sober, I feel pain
As we run under the stars through cemetery backyards
Celebrate the way the night hides scars
So dance if it moves you
Jump in the fire if it burns you
I'll throw my arms around you, darling
And we'll turn to ashes, drown me in the flames
[Chorus]
Scream in the dark!
I'm gonna light up this place and die in beautiful stars!
But if these demons keep falling from the sky, (It's alright)
'Cause sometimes I love the way you swing the blade at everything in sight!
[Bridge]
Separate me from my own two hands, I've killed so many times
But I can't save the world from the creatures that don't die
Kinda like the way you tell me, "Baby, please come home
I need you here right now
I'm crying in the water so you don't hear the sound"
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Burst into flames (What do you do when you're out of time?)
Scream in the dark (Where do you go when they're right outside?)
Gonna light up this place (And how do you scream when there's no one around?)
[Outro]
(No one around?)
And I will be the only light
I'll be the only light
