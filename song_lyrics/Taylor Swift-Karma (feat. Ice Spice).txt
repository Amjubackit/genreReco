[Intro: Ice Spice]
Karma is that girl, like (Grrah)
[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
You're talking shit for the hell of it
Addicted to betrayal, but you're relevant
You're terrified to look down
'Cause if you dare, you'll see the glare
Of everyone you burned just to get there
It's comin' back around
[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
And I keep my side of the street clean
You wouldn't know what I mean
[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
'Cause karma is my boyfriend
Karma is a god
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend
Karma's a relaxing thought
Aren't you envious that for you it's not?
Sweet like honey, karma is a cat
Purring in my lap 'cause it loves me
Flexing lik–µ a goddamn acrobat
Me and karma vibe like that
