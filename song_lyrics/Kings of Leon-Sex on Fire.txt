[Verse 1]
Lay where you're layin'
Don't make a sound
I know they're watchin'
They're watchin'
All the commotion
The kiddie-like play
It has people talkin'
Talkin'
[Chorus]
You!
Your sex is on fire
[Verse 2]
The dark of the alley
The breakin' of day
Ahead while I'm drivin'
I'm drivin'
Soft lips are open
Them knuckles are pale
Feels like you're dyin'
You're dyin'
[Chorus]
You!
Your sex is on fire
Consumed!
With what's just transpired
