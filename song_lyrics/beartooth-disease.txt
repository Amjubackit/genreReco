[Intro]
If I fall again, will it be the end?
I know it's wrong, you think I'm strong, but I just pretend
Is it takin' over, will it bury me?
Or will clarity become the cure for my disease?
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
[Verse 1]
Stuck at the surface, not makin' progress
Fallin' apart, well, I'm tryin' my hardest
Lookin' for answers, findin' a rope
Is the noose gettin' tighter? I'm losin' control
[Pre-Chorus]
Will the end make me whole again?
[Chorus]
It's like holdin' on when my grip is lost
I still feed my insecurity when I know the cost
Is it taking over, will it bury me?
Or will clarity become the cure for my disease?
[Verse 2]
I'm gettin' older, still, lost as ever
Fakin' a smile while I bury the pressure
Why does this happen? I should be fine
But I can't shake the feelin', I'm livin' a lie[Pre-Chorus]
Will the end make me whole again?
[Chorus]
It's like holdin' on when my grip is lost
I still feed my insecurity when I know the cost
Is it taking over, will it bury me?
Or will clarity become the cure for my disease?
[Bridge]
If I fall again, will it be the end?
I know it's wrong, you think I'm strong but I just pretend
Is it takin' over, will it bury me?
Or will clarity become the cure for my disease?
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
[Chorus]
It's like holdin' on when my grip is lost
I still feed my insecurity when I know the cost
Is it taking over, will it bury me?
Or will clarity become the cure for my disease?
[Outro]
Become the cure for my disease!
