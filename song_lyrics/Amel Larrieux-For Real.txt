[Intro]
I'm for real
[Verse 1]
I can run, I can race for hours and hours, and don't stop
I can float, I can fly us to the highest mountain tops
I can breathe you, I can drink in your laugh
I can... I can live on your smile
I can trip and if I can fall into your arms
I can stay there my whole life
[Chorus]
I can live, I can love
I can be better with you (With you), for real (For real)
I can hear, I can feel
I can see, I can tell you are for real (Ooh)
I can live, I can love
I can be better with you, for real (For real)
I can hear, I can feel
I can see, I can tell you are for real
[Verse 2]
I can stare, I can memorize
Your face, your hands, your hair, every part of you
I can cut off any loose ends and not even wanna keep a few
I can speak to you so honestly, I can't even run any game
I can hear a million angels singing in my ears
When I say your name, ooh
