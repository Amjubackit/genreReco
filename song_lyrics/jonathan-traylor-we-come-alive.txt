What was once dead, You brought to life
What was once dark now shines with light
Your glory fills the atmosphere
Your presence always meets us here

What is broken, You will make whole
Every ruin, You will restore
Your blood bought freedom from our chains
You raise us up from every gravе

Your power will not be denied
