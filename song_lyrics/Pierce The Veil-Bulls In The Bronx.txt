[Verse 1]
Do you know
I count your heartbeats before you sleep?
I bite my fingernails to bone
And now I crawl back under the stairwell
To a place I call my home
I really hope you enjoy the show
Because for me, it's just a bad day
You need people like me to feel
[Chorus]
Maybe we're just having too much fun
Maybe you can't handle yourself
Staring at me with your lips and tongue
[Verse 2]
You'll never know
I don't know where I'm going to sleep tonight
She said hotels are cheap and there's one down the street
But, oh, don't you threaten me with a good time
Murder the moment, my God, I'm the serpent
I'm sorry, I can't see that you truly loved me
[Chorus]
Maybe we're just having too much fun
Maybe you can't handle yourself
Staring at me with your lips and tongue
I've been having this dream that we can fly
So maybe if we never wake up, we can see the sky
