Sweet December's coming 'round
The city's big but all I've found
Is you're the truest thing in this town
And I want you now
Shadows from the streetlight shades
Watching every word you say
Never seen you look that way
And I want you now
Mmm
Nothing more than that
Dropped the needle, closed your eyes
Listened like you'd almost died
All your love in an old record pile
And I want you now
Spinning like a turning wheel
Looking like the way I feel
You can keep all that you steal
Cause I want you now
Mmm
Nothing more than that
Mmm
Nothing more than that
