[Verse 1]
I know you've been struggling
So, I tried my best
Darling, what are you running from?
I hoped you come back
All those promises
Promises have passed
I promise this
That all of this will pass
But, did you know
[Chorus]
I hate how I don't hate you?
And if I tried, I can't replace you
No, I can't replace all the memories, they're killing me, and I cannot wait for
A second chance to hold your hand, a lifetime to wait for
I hate how much I love you
What's my love to you?
[Verse 2]
It's gonna be all good
I appreciate apologies you made, but everything's changed
And it's driving me insane, it's dry when it rains
I'm terrified, I'm paralyzed, I'll never get to see your face
Now I'm stuck, sitting in the driveway
Focused on elevated heartbreak
Now I’m sitting, crying in the driveway
Woah-woah, wondering if you knew[Chorus]
I hate how I don't hate you
And if I tried, I can't replace you
No, I can't replace all the memories, they're killing me, and I cannot wait for
A second chance to hold your hand, a lifetime to wait for
I hate how much I love you, and I wish you loved me
[Outro]
Too
Wish you loved me too, too
What’s my love to you?
Wish you loved me too, too
