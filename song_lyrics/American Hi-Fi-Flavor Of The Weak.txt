[Verse 1]
She paints her nails and she don't know
He's got her best friend on the phone
She'll wash her hair
His dirty clothes are all he gives to her
[Pre-Chorus]
And he's got posters on the wall
Of all the girls he wished she was
And he means everything to her
[Chorus]
Her boyfriend, he don't know
Anything about her
He's too stoned, Nintendo
I wish that I could make her see
She's just the flavor of the weak
[Verse 2]
It's Friday night and she's all alone
He's a million miles away
She's dressed to kill, but the TV's on
He's connected to the sound
[Pre-Chorus]
And he's got pictures on the wall
Of all the girls he's loved before
And she knows all his favorite songs
