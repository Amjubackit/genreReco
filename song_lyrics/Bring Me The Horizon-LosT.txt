[Verse 1]
Watching Evangelion with a big fat slug of ketamine
I lost the plot a little while ago, oh-oh
My dog just died, my friends hate me
I saw myself on MTV, and my ego is not my amigo (
Yeah, yeah
)
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, maybe I don't belong on this planet
Red crescent moons all over my hands
It's too much to take, I can't understand it
Someone tell me
[Chorus]
Why am I this way?
Stupid medicine, not doin' anything
What the hell is fucking wrong with me?
I guess there's no remedy, I'm so terribly lost
[Verse 2]
Imaginary enemies, suicidal tendеncies
Serotonin's proper on its arsе, oh-oh
I used to go to therapy, but the doctor tried to section me
The next time that I open up to someone will be my autopsy
Because
[Pre-Chorus]
I don't think I belong on this planet
Red crescent moons all over my hands
It's too much to take, I can't fucking stand it
Someone tell me
