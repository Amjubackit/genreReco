[Intro]
Compton, Compton, Compton
Ah, real motherfuckin' G's
Ah, real motherfuckin' G's
Ah, real motherfuckin' G's
Ah, real motherfuckin' G's
[Verse 1: Eazy-E & 
Dresta
]
Ayo, Doctor, here's another proper track
And it's fat, watch the sniper, time to pay the piper
And let that real shit provoke
See, you's a wannabe Loc and you'll get smoked and I hope
That your fans understand when you talk about sprayin' me
The same records that you makin' is payin' me
Motherfuck Dre! Motherfuck Snoop! Motherfuck Death Row!
Yo, and here comes my left blow
'Cause I'm the E-A-Z-Y-E and this is the season
To let the real motherfuckin' G's in
You're like a kid, you found a pup, and now you're dapper
But tell me, where the fuck you found an anorexic rapper?
Talkin' 'bout who you gon' squabble with and who you shoot
You're only sixty pounds when you're wet and wearin' boots
Damn, E, they tried to fade you on Dre Day
But Dre Day only meant Eazy's payday
All of a sudden Dr. Dre is the G Thang
But on his own album covers he was a she-thang
So, nigga please, nigga please
Don't step to these motherfuckin' real G's
