[Verse]
What can I give that is all for you?
My heart’s not good cause it’s split in two
What can I give that is all for you?
These arms are all I have
[Chorus]
But I'll hold you like I do love you
But I'll hold you like I do love you
[Verse]
What can I give that is all for you?
My heart’s no good 'cause it’s split in two
What can I give that is all for you?
These arms are all I have
[Chorus]
But I'll hold you like I do love you
But I'll hold you like I do love you
[Instrumental]
[Chorus]
But I’ll hold you like I do love you
But I’ll hold you like I do love you
