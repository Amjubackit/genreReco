[Verse 1: Lizzy McAlpine]
It's always on the tip of my tongue
I read an article on the internet
Told me that that's how you know you're fallin' in love
Don't really trust what's on the internet
But maybe just this once
[Chorus: Lizzy McAlpine]
Hate to admit but it might be true
Hate to admit but I think you knew
Hate to be lame but I might love you
[Verse 2: Lizzy McAlpine & FINNEAS, 
Lizzy McAlpine
]
It's always on the tip of my tongue
But I stop myself from sayin' it
Tell myself it's not the right time or something dumb
But then you kiss me like you do
And we're right back where we started from
[Chorus: Lizzy McAlpine & FINNEAS]
Hatе to admit but it might be true
Hate to admit but I think you knеw
Hate to be lame but I might love you
[Bridge: Lizzy McAlpine]
Do I love him? Do I need him?
Do I want him? Do I care enough to say
That I love him, that I need him?
'Cause I don't but I want to feel okay
If I love him, if I need him
Maybe that will make him stay
If I lie, will I still feel this way?
