[Verse 1]
It isn't working
I'm a tidal wave of question marks
And you're just surfing
Leaning into me like it's an art
[Pre-Chorus]
It's so crazy
Lately you just understand my feelings
Make me see I'm capable and fine
And feeling beautified
Tonight, I'm ready to dive
[Chorus]
Maybe it's the loving in your eyes (I'm here, see through)
Maybe it's the magic in the wine (I'm feeling loose)
Maybe it's the fact that every time I fall, I lose it all
But you got me from my head to my feet
And I'm ready to dive
[Verse 2]
'Cause the water's warm
And nothing is wrong, it's all right
I'm coming out and diving in tonight
[Pre-Chorus]
I feel like it's crazy
Lately you just undеrstand my feelings
Make me see I'm capable and finе
And feeling beautified
Tonight, I'm ready to dive[Chorus]
Maybe it's the loving in your eyes (I'm here, see through)
Maybe it's the magic in the wine (I'm feeling loose)
Maybe it's the fact that every time I fall, I lose it all
But you got me from my head to my feet
And I'm ready to dive
[Bridge]
Diving into you, diving into me
Wanna swim good and I wanna swim deep
I'm diving into you, diving into me
Wanna swim good and I wanna swim deep
I'm diving into you, diving into me
Wanna swim good and I wanna swim deep
I'm diving into you, diving into me
[Chorus]
Maybe it's the loving in your eyes (I'm here, see through)
Maybe it's the magic in the wine (I'm feeling loose)
Maybe it's the fact that every time I fall, I lose it all
But you got me from my head to my feet
And I'm ready to dive
[Outro]
(Right into you)
Right into you
I'm ready to dive (Right into you)
Maybe is the fact that every time I fall, I lose it all
But you got me from my head to my feet
And I'm ready to dive
