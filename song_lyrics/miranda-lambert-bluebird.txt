[Intro]
Ooh
Ooh 
[Verse 1]
Yeah,  I'm a turner
I turn pages all the time
Don't like where I'm at
34  was bad, so I just turn to 35
Yeah,  I'm a keeper
I keep digging down for the deep
Like  the records I'm playing
They might keep you waiting
But you know I'm only playing for keeps
[Chorus]
And if the house just keeps on winning
I  got a wildcard up my sleeve
And if love keeps giving me 
lemons
I'll just mix 'em in my drink
And if the whole wide world stops singing
And all the stars go dark
I'll keep a light on in my soul
Keep a 
bluebird
 in my heart
[Post-Chorus]
Ooh
Ooh
