[Verse 1: Andrea Marie & Will Reagan]
I open up to You
This love that makes me new
Oh, may my heart receive
This love that carries me
[Chorus 1: Andrea Marie & Michael Ketterer]
From the head to the heart
You take me on a journey
Of letting go
And getting lost in You
From the head to the heart
You take me on a journey
Of letting go
And getting lost in You
[Verse 2: Andrea Marie & Michael Ketterer]
My heart is open wide
I will receive Your light
You give me faith like a child
In you, my heart runs wild
[Chorus 2: Michael Ketterer]
'Cause there's no shame
In looking like a fool
When I give You what I can't keep
To take a hold of You
There's no shame
In looking like a fool
When I give You what I can't keep
To take a hold of You[Bridge: Will Reagan]
More than words
More than good ideas
I found Your love in the open fields
More than words
More than good ideas
I found Your love in the open fields
More than words
More than good ideas
I found Your love in the open fields
[Chorus 1: Will Reagan]
From the head to the heart
You take me on a journey
Of letting go
And getting lost in You
From the head to the heart
You take me on a journey
Of letting go
And getting lost in You
[Chorus 2: Michael Ketterer]
There's no shame
In looking like a fool
When I give You what I can't keep
To take a hold of You
There's no shame
In looking like a fool
When I give You what I can't keep
To take a hold of You[Outro: Michael Ketterer]
And take a hold of You
And take a hold of You
And take a hold of You
And take a hold of You
