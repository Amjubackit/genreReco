[Verse 1]
Your twenties are for spending hours and hours pretending
We have plans and we have places we should visit
But everybody knows your twenties are for wasting time
'Cause you could be with anyone you wanted, you could
Take that job they offered and move down by the ocean
But I love the way your hand feels when its under mine
[Chorus 1]
I don’t wanna take the world for granted
While I’m still trying to understand it
The more I live, I am convinced
Everyone just wants to be in love
[Verse 2]
This world makes me dizzy; how’d we get so busy?
No one tries to take the time it takes to turn your
Love into a love or friends into a family
Well, I don’t want any false religion
I will practice loving you with no conditions
And I’ll give up what I have to just so I can have you
[Chorus 2]
Everybody’s chasing something
But they don’t know they’re chasing someone
The more I live I am convinced
Everyone just wants to be in love[Bridge]
Lots of little life we take for granted when we
Finish our Decembers empty-handed
But I’m never empty-handed when I’m holding your hand
I may never be a politician
Or make a lot of money, or hold a high position
But baby, you’re my mission and all my glory days are yours
[Chorus 1]
I don't wanna take the world for granted
While I'm still trying to understand it
The more I live, I am convinced
Everyone just wants to be in love
