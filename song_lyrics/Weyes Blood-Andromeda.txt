[Verse 1]
Andromeda's a big wide open galaxy
Nothing in it for me
'Cept my heart that's lazy
Runnin' from my own life now
I'm really turnin' some time
Looking up to the sky for something I may never find
[Chorus 1]
Stop calling
It's time to let me be
If you think you can save me
I dare you to try
[Verse 2]
Lift the heart from the depths it's fallen to
We all want something new
But can't seem to follow through
Something's better than nothing
Or so that I thought
Now I know it's just one dream
All these others gonna tear me apart
[Chorus 2]
Love is calling
It's time to let it through
Find a love that will make you
I dare you to try
