[Verse 1: Jonathan McReynolds]
I'm closing chapters
I'm turning pages
Glory to glory
And from faith to favor
[Refrain: Jonathan McReynolds]
I'm moving on
I'm moving on
I'm moving on
[Verse 2: Jonathan McReynolds]
I'm getting older
So I'll keep it straight
It hurts to let go
But it hurts more to stay
[Refrain: Jonathan McReynolds]
I'm moving on
I'm moving on, hey
I'm moving on
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
[Chorus: Jonathan McReynolds]
I know my rearview (Ooh, ooh)
Can't compare to what God will do with my life (Ooh, ooh)
I am forgetting what's behind me (Ooh, ooh)
I have finally decided (Ooh, ooh)
