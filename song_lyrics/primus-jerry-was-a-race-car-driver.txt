[Intro]
Fire it up, man!
[Verse 1]
Jerry was a race car driver
He drove so goddamned fast
Never did win no checkered flags
But he never did come in last
Jerry was a race car driver
He'd say "El Sob number one"
With a Bocephus sticker on his 442
He'd light 'em up just for fun
[Chorus]
Ah
Ah
[Verse 2]
Captain Pierce was a fireman
Richmond engine number three
I'll be a wealthy man when I get a dime
For all the things that man he taught to me
Now Captain Pierce was a strong man
Strong as any man alive
Stuck in his craw that they made him retire
At the age of sixty-five[Chorus]
Ah
Ah
[Bridge]
Go!
Heh, heh, heh, heh
Dog will hunt!
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Ah
Ah
[Verse 3]
Jerry was a race car driver
Twenty-two years old
One too many cold beers one night
And wrapped himself around a telephone pole, go!
