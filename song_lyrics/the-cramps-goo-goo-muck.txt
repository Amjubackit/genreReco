[Verse 1]
Well, when the sun goes down and the moon comes up
I turn into a teenage goo goo muck
Yeah, I cruise through the city and I roam the street
A-looking for something that is nice to eat, mmm
[Chorus]
You better duck
When I show up
The goo goo muck
[Verse 2]
I'm the night headhunter looking for some head
With a way-out body underneath that head, ooh
Yeah, I'll get you, baby, with a little luck
'Cause I'm a teenage tiger and a goo goo muck
[Chorus]
You better duck
When I show up
The goo goo muck
Caw, caw, caw, caw
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Verse 3]
Yeah, the city is a jungle and I'm a beast, ha-ha
I'm a teenage tiger looking for a feast, ooh
Yeah, I want the most, but I'll take the least
'Cause I'm a goo goo muck tiger and a teenage beast, uh-huh[Chorus]
You better duck
When I show up
The goo goo muck
[Outro]
Caw, caw, caw, caw, caw
Caw, caw, caw, caw
Caw, caw, caw, caw, caw, caw, caw, caw
Muck, muck, muck
The goo goo muck
