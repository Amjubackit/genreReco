[Verse 1]
Come in quiet, come in close
Give Him reverence, give Him love
Lift Him up
Lift Him up
Let His fire fill your soul
Offer Him what matters most
Lift Him up
Lift Him up

Ho-ho-ho-ho-holy
Ho-ho-ho-ho-holy
Holy is the Lord Almighty
Ho-ho-ho-ho-holy
Ho-ho-ho-ho-holy
Holy is the Lord Almighty

Sing the song that won't grow old
Name that all of Heaven knows
Who was, and is, and is to come
We'll lift Him up
