[Verse 1]
My big brother rode an Indian Scout
It was black like his jacket
American Spirit hangin' outta his mouth
Just like our daddy
He kicked-started that bike one night and broke mama's heart
He pointed that headlight West, out where the wild things are
[Verse 2]
He'd call me up every couple of weeks
From South California
Talk about the desert and the Joshua Tree
And his pretty girl stories
How he bought an Airstream trailer and a J-45 guitar
Said, "Little brother, you'd love it out here, out where the wild things are"
[Chorus]
Oh, oh-oh, it's hearts on fire and crazy dreams
Oh, oh-oh, the nights ignite like gasoline
And light up those streets that never sleep when the sky goes dark
Out where the wild things are
[Verse 3]
I called my brother from the back of that plane
The second I made it
We started drinkin' on the strip in L.A
And then it got crazy
Ended up at a house in the hills with some Hollywood stars
Kissin' on a blonde in a backyard pool, out where the wild things are
