[Verse 1]
I'm gonna make ya understand this pain
Time keeps slipping, hours turn to days
[Pre-Chorus]
Does the sight of a grave make you feel all alone?
We’re all right, we're okay, face a fear, the unknown
What's it like to be brave when a tear starts to flow?
I’ve seen worse, I've seen worse, I've seen worse, I've seen worse
I've seen worse
[Chorus]
This is our life
This is when no one else will listen to ya
This is our life
This is when everyone is vicious to ya
[Verse 2]
I gotta keep these dreams locked in my cage
Lies we keep teaching on every single page
[Pre-Chorus]
Does the sight of a grave make you feel all alone?
We're all right, we're okay, face a fear, the unknown
What's it like to be brave when a tear starts to flow?
I’ve seen worse, I’ve seen worse, I've seen worse, I’ve seen worse
I've seen worse[Chorus]
This is our life
This is when no one else will listen to ya
This is our life
This is when everyone is vicious to ya
[Pre-Chorus]
Does the sight of a grave make you feel all alone?
We're all right, we're okay, face a fear, the unknown
What’s it like to be brave when a tear starts to flow?
I've seen worse, I've seen worse, I've seen worse, I've seen worse
I've seen worse
[Bridge]
You kick me in the teeth
I'll get right back up
But you keep this shit up, kid
'Cause I've seen what's worse
[Chorus]
This is our life
This is when no one else will listen to ya
This is our life
This is when everyone is vicious to ya
