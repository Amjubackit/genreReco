[Refrain]
Well, a good dog on the ground's worth three in the saddle
No matter where you're from
Been many good dog was a friend to a man
But Sam was the greatest one
He was a hound of hounds
He was the wonder of all walkers
He loved howlin' at the moon
He loved treein' that raccoon
Most of all, he was my best friend
And he's gone too soon
[Bridge]
He was the runt of the litter, but a plenty mean pup
Put Sam on the scent, and he never let up
Spent his nights on the porch, chеwin' on a bare bone
Now he's undеrground, and I'm all alone
[Refrain]
Well, a good dog on the ground's worth three in the saddle
No matter where you're from
Been many good dog was a friend to a man
But Sam was the greatest one
He was a hound of hounds
He was the wonder of all walkers
He loved howlin' at the moon
He loved treein' that raccoon
Most of all, he was my best friend
And he's gone too soon
