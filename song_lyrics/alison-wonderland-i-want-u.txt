[Verse 1]
I know you've seen it
Don't try to beat it
I want the pressure off
But it continues until I kiss you
So let's just take it off
We've waited all night
Spoken 'til sunlight
Can you please take my hand?
It's bittersweet when
You know it must end
Just tell me where I stand
[Chorus]
I want you
I-I-I-I want you
[Verse 2]
You know I like you
I'll give it to you
Will you just say it's on?
Why did you come here
If you don't want to?
The feeling's just so strong
Just give me one look
To give me some hope
I wish I was alone
Could we just stay here
And let the time pass?
I'll write it in a song[Chorus]
I want you
I-I-I-I want you
[Bridge]
I just want you
I just want you
I just want you
I just want you
Just give me one look (I just want you)
Just give me one look (I just want you)
Just give me one look (I just want you)
Just give me one look (I just want you)
Just give me one look (I just want you)
Just give me one look (I just want you)
Just give me one look (I just want you)
Just give me one look
[Chorus]
I want you
I want you
[Outro]
I just want you
I just want you
I just want you
I just want you, I
I-I-I-I want you
