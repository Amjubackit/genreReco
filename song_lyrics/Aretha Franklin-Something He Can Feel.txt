[Intro]
(Shoo doo.) Shoo doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
(Shoo doo.) Shoo doo, shoo doo, shoo doo, doo
(Shoo doo.) Oh, shoo doo, doo, doo
(Shoo doo.) Oh, oh, oh
[Verse 1]
Many say that I'm too young
To let you know just where I'm coming from
Oh
But you will see that it's just a matter of time
My love will surely make you mine
Oh, oh, oh, oh
[Pre-Chorus]
Living in a world of ghetto life
Everybody around seems so uptight
Nothing's wrong, it's alright with my man, my man
I like the kind of ways we have our fun
His loving ways send me on and on
Yeah, hey, with my man
People out there can understand
[Chorus]
I'm giving him something he can feel, ah, ah, ah
To let him know (this love is real) my love is real
Yeah, hey, hey, hey, I'm giving him, him something he can feel
Yes I am, baby
(To let him know this love is real) To let you know my love is real
(This love is real) Mmmm, hmmm, hmmm, mmmm
