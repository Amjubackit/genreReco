Now your love gone bad
Yeah your love gone bad
Now the sea is mad
Yeah the sailor is sad
To the siren's wail
Now your love done gone
Yeah your love done gone
So godamn gone
Left you all alone
Clouds hid the sun
Ohhhh oh wee
Ohhhh oh wee
Now you're all in pain
Sweet goddamn pain
Let the nighttime reign
Driving you insane
Like a dog in the rain
Now you're all in pain
Sweet goddamn pain
Let the nighttime reign
Driving you insane
Like a dog in the rainOhhhh oh wee
Ohhhh oh wee
