[Intro]
Uh
Skrt, skrt
Boombox shit
Yah, yah
[Chorus]
Pull up in a 'Rari
That’s a new wip (skrt, skrt)
Pull up with a Barbie
She got new lips (win)
I got a new bank roll
I walk with a limp (racks)
Eating calamari
Stay with the shrimp (eat up)
I got a new Virgil
I'm fly like a blimp (drip)
Out in Tokyo, shit
I feel like a pimp
Models in my section
Ciroc with the ice
I am not Rae Sremmurd
Baby I gotta a type (ok)
[Buildup]
Skrt, skrt
Pull up in a 'Rari (ya)
That’s a new whip (ok)[Drop]
(Ooh, skrt)
(Skrt, skrt)
Pull up in a 'Rari
That's a new whip (ok)
(Ooh, skrt)
(Skrt, skrt)
Pull up in a 'Rari
That's a new whip (skrt)
[Verse]
You wanna get on
I could give you advice
Pussy so good
It's gone change your life
Have you goin' through some shit
Like a baby wipe
Salute your boy, yeah
I'm the Navy type
Durag fly
I’m the wavy type (uh)
If we pull up clean
I’m Mercedes white
Yeah, I'm high like 80 flights
Losing weight, Kelly Price
Baker tee, skater life (Yuh-yo)
Lose yourself, get your life[Chorus]
Pull up in a ’Rari
That's a new wip (skrt, skrt)
Pull up with a Barbie
She got new lips (win)
I got a new bank roll
I walk with a limp (racks)
Eating calamari
Stay with the shrimp (eat up)
I got a new Virgil
I'm fly like a blimp (drip)
Out in Tokyo, shit
I feel like a pimp
Models in my section
Ciroc with the ice
I am not Rae Sremmurd
Baby I gotta a type (ok)
[Buildup]
Skrt, skrt
Pull up in a 'Rari (ya)
That’s a new whip (ok)
