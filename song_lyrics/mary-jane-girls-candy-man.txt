[Verse 1: JoJo McDuffie]
When I wake up in the mornin’
You bring me breakfast in my bed
And when I need a little sugar
That’s when you go to my head
You’re the sweetest (Candy man) man I know
And I’ll never let you go
Just say you’ll stay (Candy man) with me forever
And our love will surely grow, ooh, ooh
[Chorus: JoJo McDuffie & 
Mary Jane Girls
]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
You can be my candy man, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
‘Cause I really know you can, hey hey
Candy man, candy man
Ooh hoo
[Verse 2: JoJo McDuffie]
When you wake up in the mornin’
And affection’s on your mind
You just call me up now, baby
And I’ll always find the time
You’re the sweetest (Candy man) man I know
And I thought I’d tell you so
Just say you’ll stay with me (Candy man) forever
And our love will surely grow, ooh, ooh[Chorus: JoJo McDuffie & 
Mary Jane Girls
]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
You can be my candy man, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
‘Cause I really know you can, oh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah yeah, be my, be my candy man
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Hoo-hoo, ‘cause I know, I know you can
I know, I know you can
