[Intro]
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
[Verse 1]
What was once dead, You brought to life
What was once dark now shines with light
Your glory fills the atmosphere
Your presence always meets us here
[Chorus]
We come alive
We come alive
We come alive
We come alive
[Verse 2]
What is broken, You will make whole
Every ruin, You will restore
Your blood bought freedom from our chains
You raise us up from every gravе
[Chorus]
We come alive
Wе come alive
We come alive
We come alive
