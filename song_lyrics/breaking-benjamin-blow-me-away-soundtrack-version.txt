[Verse 1]
They fall in line, one at a time
Ready to play
(I can't see them anyway)
No time to lose, we've got to move
Steady your hand
(I am losing sight again)
[Pre-Chorus]
Fire your guns, it's time to run
Blow me away
(I will stay in the mess I made)
After the fall, we'll shake it off
Show me the way
[Chorus]
Only the strongest will survive
Lead me to heaven when we die
I am the shadow on the wall
I'll be the one to save us all
[Verse 2]
There's nothing left so save your breath
Lying in wait
(Caught inside this tidal wave)
Your cover's blown, nowhere to go
Holding your fate
(Loaded I will walk alone)[Pre-Chorus]
Fire your guns, it's time to run
Blow me away
(I will stay in the mess I made)
After the fall, we'll shake it off
Show me the way
[Chorus]
Only the strongest will survive
Lead me to heaven when we die
I am the shadow on the wall
I'll be the one to save us all
[Bridge]
Oh, you wanted it back
(Don't make me beg!)
(Enough!)
(Die!)
[Chorus]
Only the strongest will survive
Lead me to heaven when we die
I am the shadow on the wall
I'll be the one to save us all
Save us all
