[Verse 1]
Do you know what's worth fightin' for
When it's not worth dyin' for?
Does it take your breath away
And you feel yourself suffocatin'?
Does the pain weigh out the pride
And you look for a place to hide?
Did someone break your heart inside?
You're in ruins
[Chorus]
One, twenty-one guns
Lay down your arms and give up the fight
One, twenty-one guns
Throw up your arms into the sky
You and I
[Verse 2]
When you're at the end of the road
And you lost all sense of control
And your thoughts have taken their toll
When your mind breaks the spirit of your soul
Your faith walks on broken glass
And the hangover doesn't pass
Nothin's ever built to last
You're in ruins
