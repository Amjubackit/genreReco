[Verse]
Go to the dark side for you
You shoot the apple off of my head
Cause your love, sweet love, is all that you put me through
And honey without it, you know I'd rather be dead
[Chorus]
I'm tied up
I'm tangled up
And I'm all wrapped up
In you
I'm tied up
I'm tangled up
And I'm all wrapped up
In you
[Verse]
Now that I'm neck deep in this fire
And that's not the least of what I would do
Cause your love, sweet love, is all but a burning desire
And sugar you know that I burn for you
[Chorus]
I'm tied up
Tangled up
And I'm all wrapped up
In youI'm tied up
Tangled up
I'm all wrapped up
In you
Tied up
I'm tangled up
And I'm all wrapped up
In you
I'm tied up
I'm tangled up
Wrapped up
In you, you, you
