[Verse 1: Josiah Johnson]
Honeybee
Could you imagine where our lives would lead?
That silly ring, it wasn't meant to be
Luckily, you saw in me something I couldn't see
Honeybee
I can't imagine how my life would be
If all your gravity did not hit me
Oh, don't you see? Darling, my honeybee
[Pre-Chorus: Charity Rose Thielen]
But here we are
After all the messes and confessions
To the stars
That we never really owned as ours
[Chorus: Charity Rose Thielen]
And if our world comes tumbling down
I never could forgive myself for leaving out
You're the one, you are the only one
[Verse 2: Josiah Johnson]
Such a fool
I took your love and I bent all the rules
You took the blow and didn't let it show
Stuck around to let me know
Built a family of our own
Look around
We made a garden of the love we found
So many reasons I would fight to stay
You're the courage when I fade
Take a look at what we've made
