Sing a song
Holler and scream
My fruit will bleed
My fruit will bleed
Oh, my son
What have you done?
Dirt always tells
Dirt always tells
Hold your heart
Bury the shovel
Rumours and spells
Rumours and spells
Hold your tongue
Bury the rope
Hammers and nails
Hammers and nails
Hammers and nails
Hammers and nails
(Bury it down, down)
(Bury it down, down)
(Bury it down, down)
(Bury it down, down)
(Bury it down, down)
(Bury it down, down)
(Bury it down, down)
(Bury it down, down)(Woah, woah)
(Woah, woah)
(Woah, woah)
(Woah, woah)
(Woah, woah)
(Woah, woah)
(Woah, woah)
(Woah, woah)
Sing a song
Holler and scream
My fruit will bleed
My fruit will bleed
Hold your tongue
Bury the rope
Hammers and nails
Hammers and nails
