[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
There's an echo pulling out the meaning
Rescuing a nightmare from a dream
The voices in my head are always screaming
That none of this means anything to me
[Pre-Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
And it's a long way back from seventeen
The whispers turn into a scream
And I...
I'm not coming home
[Chorus: Matt Skiba and 
Mark Hoppus
]
Save your breath, I'm nearly bored to death, and fading fast
Life is too short to last long
Back on earth I'm broken, lost and cold, and fading fast
Life is too short to last long
[Verse 2: Matt Skiba]
There's a stranger staring at the ceiling
Rescuing a tiger from a tree
The pictures in her head are always dreaming
Each of them means everything to me
[Pre-Chorus: Matt Skiba]
And it's a long way back from seventeen
The whispers turn into a scream
And I...
I'm not coming home
