[Verse 1]
Mary is the girl that I wanna kiss
She's got big red eyes and big red lips
She's got big sharp teeth and big fat hips
[Verse 2]
Mary is the girl that I wanna fuck
She's got leather heart and leather gloves
She's the only girl that I wanna love
[Bridge 1]
Listen to me, baby, I don't mind
I wanna be with you and waste my time
[Bridge 2]
Give it to me, baby, I feel good
I wanna feel whatever you think I should
[Bridge 3]
Sing it for me, baby, play my song
I wanna hear your daddy sing along
[Verse 3]
Mary is the girl that leaves you to rot
She says, "I am real, and you are not"
She says, "I am real, and you are not"
