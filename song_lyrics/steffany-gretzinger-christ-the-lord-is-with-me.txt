[Verse 1: Steffany Gretzinger & Amanda Cook]
I have never walked alone
You were with me through it all
Broken hearts and broken bones
You have always held me close
There's no place that I could go
Heavens high or hell below
I have lived enough to know
Anywhere with You is home
[Chorus: Steffany Gretzinger]
Hallelujah, Christ the Lord is with me
Hallelujah, Christ the Lord is with me
Hallelujah, Christ the Lord is with me
[Interlude]
[Verse 2: Steffany Gretzinger & Amanda Cook]
Now I live with confidence
That nothing in my universe
Could ever separate me from
Jesus, everlasting love
There's no height and there's no depth
True in life and true in death
You keep Your covenant
Great will be Your faithfulness
[Chorus: Steffany Gretzinger & Amanda Cook]
Hallelujah, Christ the Lord is with me
Hallelujah, Christ the Lord is with me
Hallelujah, Christ the Lord is with me
Christ the Lord is with me
Christ the Lord is with me
Hallelujah, Christ the Lord is with me
Hallelujah, Christ the Lord is with me
Hallelujah, Christ the Lord is with me
[Outro: Wonder Grace Gretzinger]
Hallelujah, Christ the Lord is with us
Hallelujah, Christ the Lord is with us
Hallelujah, Christ the Lord is with us
