[Chorus: Justin Pierre]
Tell me that you're alright
Yeah, everything is alright
Oh please, tell me that you're alright
Yeah, everything is alright
[Verse 1: Justin Pierre]
Give me a reason
To end this discussion
To break with tradition
To fold and divide
'Cause I hate the ocean, theme parks, and airplanes
Talking with strangers, waiting in line..
I'm through with these pills that make me sit still
"Are you feeling fine?" Yes, I feel just fine
[Chorus: Justin Pierre]
Tell me that you're alright
Yeah, everything is alright
Oh please, tell me that you're alright
Yeah, everything is alright
[Verse 2: Justin Pierre]
I'm sick of the things I do when I'm nervous
Like cleaning the oven or checking my tires
Or counting the number of tiles in the ceiling..
Head for the hills, the kitchen's on fire!
I used to rely on self-medication
I guess I still do that from time to time
But I'm getting better at fighting the future
"Someday you'll be fine..." Yes, I'll be just fine
