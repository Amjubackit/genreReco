To the One who wore
A crown of thorns
To the One who took
The lash and scourge
For the hands and feet
That were pierced by nails
For the sacrifice
That has torn the veil
We crown You!
We fall face down and we worship!
We all cry out “You are worthy God!”
“You are worthy, God!”
(You are worthy, so worthy)
To the One who gave
His very life away
Who took upon Himself
All our guilt and shame
Hanging on a cross
For the world He loved
With His precious blood
Purchased men for God
We crown You!
We fall face down and we worship!
We all cry out “You arе worthy God!”
“You are worthy, God!”
To the One
Who еndured
All the shame of the cross
To the Lamb
Who was slain
As atonement for us
To the Son
Who overcame
All the power of death
We praise…
For the stripes
For the wounds
For the beating You bore
For the tears
For the blood
That was willingly poured
For the merciful, wonderful, majesty of Your love!
We crown You!
We fall face down and we worship!
We all cry out “You are worthy God!”
“You are worthy, God!”
