[Verse 1]
Sunshine, bathe me, lately life been crazy
Your eyes, tell all, we outside with it, your call
Move me, need me, uh, care about it, breath deep
You see what I miss, uh, holdin' on to ya with a tight grip, uh
Light lit, uh, no cap, uh, heart spilled all over the floor mat
Tongue out, I don’t know how to hold that, nowadays, I don’t really want to hold back
[Chorus]
Yeah, so I hit 'em where it hurts
Yeah, uh, so I hit 'em where it hurts, set sail, lighthouse, search, yeah, yeah
Uh-uh, so I hit 'em where it hurts, yeah
So I hit 'em where it hurts, set sail, lighthousе, search
I've been down with you, you've been down with mе
We know this ain’t all talk
I've been down with you, you've been down with me
We know this ain’t all talk
[Bridge]
I’m on a quest-love, learn my roots
Think that black thought, this my truth
This that tipping point, this that proof, uh
Go ahead, spark it up, we off mute, uh
Loud and clear now, that sound good?
Life in motion, like it should
Came a long way, play that long game
Yesterday gone, we’re on our way, yeah, yeah, uh[Chorus]
So I hit 'em where it hurts, set sail, lighthouse, search, yeah, uh-uh
So I hit 'em where it hurts, set sail, lighthouse, search, yeah, yeah, uh-uh
So I hit 'em where it hurts, set sail, lighthouse, search, yeah, uh
So I hit 'em where it hurts, set sail, lighthouse, search
I've been down with you, you've been down with me
We know this ain’t all talk
I've been down with you, you've been down with me
We know this ain’t all talk, set sail, lighthouse, search
[Outro]
Set sail, lighthouse, search
Uh-uh, hehe, yeah, uh
Set sail, lighthouse, search
Uh, uh-uh
