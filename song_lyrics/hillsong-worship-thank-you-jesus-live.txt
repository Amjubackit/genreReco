[Verse 1]
Grace that flows like a river
Washing over me
Fount of heaven, love of Christ
Overflow in me
[Chorus]
Thank You, Jesus
You set me free
Christ my Saviour
You rescued me
[Verse 2]
Take this life delivered
A vessel of Your love
Wholly now devoted
To see Your kingdom come
[Chorus]
Thank You, Jesus
You set me free
Christ my Saviour
You rescued me
Thank You, Jesus
You set me free
Christ my Saviour
You rescued me[Instrumental]

You've opened my eyes
I love You, Lord
I love You, Lord
You've entered my heart
You've set me apart
I love You, Lord
I love You, Lord
You've given me life
You've opened my eyes
I love You, Lord
I love You, Lord
You've entered my heart
You've set me apart
I love You, Lord
I love You, Lord!
