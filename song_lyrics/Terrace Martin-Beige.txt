[Verse 1: Elena Pinderhughes]
Are you tryna say you're willin’?
Are you tryna say you get it?
You know there's a way to this, way to this
Please don't play no games with this, OK?
Gotta hold your weight in this, weight in this
Everything we have it just be so, uh
And I’m tryin to save it
Seems like lately we've fallen all the way down
It don't feel the same now
If you're tryin to save it
I've been mistaken
'Cause nothin's changing
My heart is breaking
[Chorus]
Love don't have to be so hard
So, tell me, how’d we get this far?
Love don’t have to be so hard
Let down your guard
[Verse 2: Arin Ray]
If I'm being honest babe
I’ve been standing right here with you
A nigga been down since day one
If they ain't, shit you got a screw loose
If I'm been honest babe (If I'm being honest)
I don’t really care for things like
Pressin', no extras, no testin' me, please
If I'm not good enough
Scoodadoo-bop-bop
That's just our luck
Tears dripping down your socks
No more wasting time now
If you with it, just be with it
'Cause it's fortunate that we go through shit 
now
Everything's goin' to be like this, baby
