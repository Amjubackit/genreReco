[Intro: Quavo]
Woo, woo, woo, woo
Woo, woo, woo, woo
[Verse 1: Quavo]
Dance with my dogs in the nighttime (Wroof)
Trap nigga with the chickens like Popeyes (Popeyes)
Money changin' colors like tie-dye (Tie-dye)
I'm just tryna get it, I ain't tryna die (No)
She got a big ol' onion booty, make the world cry (Cry)
In the kitchen, wrist twistin' like it's stir fry (Whip it)
Hold them bands down (Hey), hold your mans down (Hey)
Who told you come around? (Who?) This that trap sound (Trap)
Designer clothes (Clothes), fashion shows (Shows)
Trap house (House) made of gold (Gold)
Control the bag now (Control it), no need to brag now (No need)
Ayy, put the mask down (Mask), we livin' fast now (Fast)
Finest hoes (Finest), wrist froze (Ho)
We can  go (We can) coast to coast (Coast)
[Chorus: Quavo]
Keep watchin' me whip up
Still be real and famous, yeah
Dance with my dogs in the nighttime (Woo, woo, woo, wroof)
In the kitchen, wrist twistin' like it's stir fry (Whip it)
In the kitchen, wrist twistin' like it's stir fry (Whip it)
In the kitchen, wrist twistin' like it's stir fry (Whip it)
In the kitchen, wrist twistin' like it's stir fry (Whip it)
