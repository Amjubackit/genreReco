[Intro: Kendrick Lamar & 
Kadhja Bonet
]
I pop the pain away, I slide the pain away
I pop the pain away, I slide the pain away
I picked you up when you fell and cut your knee
I told you not to cry and held you close to 
me
[Chorus: Blxst]
I hope I'm not too late to set my demons straight
I know I made you wait, but how much can you take?
I hope you see the God in me, I hope you can see
And if it's up, stay down for me, yeah
[Post-Chorus: Amanda Reifer]
Shimmy, shimmy, cocoa puff
Serafina, flame in us
Where I'd be without your love
Rest your wings and trust, I feel you
Deep (I know you feel), deep (Know you feel)
Deep (I know you feel), deep (Too deep)
Deep (I know you feel), deep (Know you feel)
Deep (I know you feel), deep
[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Do you love me? (Okay) Do you trust me? (Okay)
Can I trust you? (Okay) Don't judge me (Okay)
I'ma die hard, it gets ugly (Okay)
Too passionate, it gets ugly (Okay)
Mmm, ah-ah
I wonder where I lost my way
Mmm, ah-ah
Been waiting on your call all day
Tell me you in my corner right now
When I fall short, I'm leaning on you to cry out
We all got enough to lie about
My truth too complicated to hide now
Can I open up? Is it safe or not?
I'm afraid a little, you relate or not?
Have faith a little, I might take my time
Ain't no saving face this time
