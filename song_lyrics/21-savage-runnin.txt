[Intro: Diana Ross & 
21 Savage
]
Am I really hard to please?
Perhaps I have such special needs
I wondered what was wrong with me (
Haha
)
My friends all fall so easily (
Pussies
)
[Verse 1: 21 Savage]
Called the first one 
Savage Mode
, my mood, that's what it was (21)
2016, we was ridin' around, beatin' niggas up in the club
I know she around for the money, but act like she loyal, I don't feel the love (21)
I'm so rich, get bored, might wake up, buy me a car just 'cause (On God)
Her titties is hard 'cause she spent a five, my bitch titties cost me a dub (21)
All my bitches got BBLs, all my bitches got butts (Straight up)
I ain't with thе rap beef, Draco pedophile, all of my opps get touchеd (Straight up)
We ain't never ran off on no barber, but we still be hoppin' out cuts (Straight up)
[Chorus: 21 Savage]
Runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'
Runnin', runnin', I leave all my cars
Runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'
Runnin', runnin', all my opps be
Runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'
Runnin', runnin', wipe his nose, it was
Runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'
Runnin', runnin', Savage never did no
