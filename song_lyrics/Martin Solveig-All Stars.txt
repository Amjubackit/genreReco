[Chorus]
(Turn on)
We all stars, we are one
We light up the night like a black sun
We all shine, we are chrome
And we are shimmering
Turn on, turn on (turn on)
[Verse 1]
Play it loud, we don't care
And dance like there's nobody there
Light up the night, yeah
Light it up every night
'Cause we are shimmering
Turn on, turn on (turn on)
[Chorus]
We all stars, we are one
We light up the night like a black sun
We all shine, we are chrome
And we are shimmering
Come on, come on y'all (hey)
We all stars, we are one
We light up the night like a black sun
We all shine, we are chrome
And we are shimmering
Turn on, turn on (turn on)
