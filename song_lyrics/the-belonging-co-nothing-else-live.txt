[Instrumental]
[Verse 1]
I'm caught up in Your presence
I just want to sit here at Your feet
I'm caught up in this holy moment
I never want to leave
[Verse 2]
Oh, I'm not here for blessings
Jesus, You don't owe me anything
More than anything that You can do
I just want You
[Chorus]
I'm sorry when I've just gone through the motions
I'm sorry when I just sang another song
Take me back to where we started
I open up my heart to You
I'm sorry when I've come with my agenda
I'm sorry when I forgot that You're enough
Take me back to where we started
I open up my heart to You
[Verse 1]
I'm caught up in Your presence
I just want to sit here at Your feet
I'm caught up in this holy moment
I never want to leave[Verse 2]
Oh, I'm not here for blessings
Jesus, You don't owe me anything
More than anything that You can do
I just want You
[Bridge]
I just want You
Nothing else, nothing else
Nothing else will do
I just want You
Nothing else, nothing else
Nothing else will do
I just want You
Nothing else, nothing else
Nothing else will do
I just want You
Nothing else, nothing else
Nothing else will do
I just want You
Nothing else, nothing else
Nothing else will do
I just want You
Nothing else, nothing else
Nothing else will doI just want You
Nothing else, nothing else
Nothing else will do
I just want You
Nothing else, nothing else
Nothing else will do
I just want You
Nothing else, nothing else
Nothing else will do
I just want You

[Spontaneous]
I'm sorry when I've come with my agenda
I'm sorry when I forgot You're enough
Jesus, You're enough
I remember now
I remember now
You're enough[Verse 1]
I'm caught up in Your presence

I'm caught up in this holy moment
I never want to leave
[Verse 2]

Jesus, You don't owe me anything
More than anything that You can do
