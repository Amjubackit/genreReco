[Intro]
I know that it seems sometimes, that no matter what you do
Or no matter how hard you work, striving to make things better in your life, but
For some reason, you're not getting nowhere
Well, I want you to turn to the one next to you
And tell him
[Verse 1: Marvin Sapp]
You tried your way
It didn't work, no
You put Him second (Second, yeah!)
And put you first (Oh, yeah!)
You trusted friends (Mhh)
Thought they had your back (Oo-ooo)
And every time you turn around
It seems you're under attack, yeah, yeah, yeah
But turn to your neighbor and say
(Neighbor)
[Chorus: Marvin Sapp]
See the devil is a liar (Neighbor)
No, I'm not gon' die (Neighbor)
It's okay to cry (Neighbor)
‘Cause He's by your side (Neighbor)
You gotta stop that hatin' (Neighbor)
I know you don't wanna hear it (Neighbor)
Gotta fast and pray and listen (Neighbor) to the Spirit
(God's tryna tell me something)
He's speaking to your heart right now
(God's tryna tell me something)
Just listen to the Spirit, ohh
(God's tryna tell me something)
Hold up, (Shh)
(Listen)
[Verse 2: Marvin Sapp]
Hmm, you lost your job (I lose it)
Your bills are due (Due-hu)
And all the people you helped (Ooo-you helped)
Did not want to help you (Uuu-u-u)
I talked to my mother
(She said “Pray about it“)
I talked to my pastor
(And he said “Pray about it“)
But I was so blinded (Ooo-o-o)
I own my disaster
I wish you would just turn to your neighbor
Turning for me
(Neighbor)
[Chorus: Marvin Sapp]
See the devil is a liar (Neighbor)
No, you're not gon' die (Neighbor)
It's okay to cry (Neighbor)
‘Cause He's by your side (Neighbor)
You gotta stop that hatin' (Neighbor)
I know you don't wanna hear it (Neighbor)
Gotta fast and pray and listen (Neighbor) to the Spirit, Ooo-o-o
(God's tryna tell me something)
He's speaking to your heart right now
(God's tryna tell me something)
Just listen to the Spirit, ohh
(God's tryna tell me something)
Hold up, (Shh)
(Listen)
Yeah-ey yeah, oh-oh
[Bridge: Marvin Sapp]
I did everything I could to take away my trouble
And everything I tried did not stop my struggle
Just doing me every day
Guess I was in my own way
But I'm here to tell you, without His grace I'm a major failure
So if you got problems (You got problems)
Know that you can't fix it (You can't fix it)
Just give it to Jesus, (Jesus)  oh (Ooh) can I get a witness
And tell him say (Neighbor)
That the devil is a liar (Neighbor)
You gotta listen to the Spirit (Oh-neighbor)
Woahhhh, God is
[Chorus: Marvin Sapp]
(God's tryna tell you something)
Shh, shh, shh
Yes He is, He's trying to get your attention right now
(God's tryna tell you something)
I know you got your own plan, but ah, God's got a better one
Oohoo-o-o-o
(God's tryna tell you something)
Shh, listen
Mmm-m-m-m
(God's tryna tell you something)
Tell me, can you hear it
(God's tryna tell you something)
Listen to the Spirit (Yeah)
(God's tryna tell you something)
Shh, listen
Yee-he-he-he
(God's tryna tell you something)
Tell me, can you hear it
(God's tryna tell you something)
Listen to the Spirit (Yeah)
(God's tryna tell you something)
Shh, listen
You tried your way
It didn't work, no
You put Him second
And put you first...
