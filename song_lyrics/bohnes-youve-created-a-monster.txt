[Verse 1]
Breathing, never prey
Becomes the hunter
Screaming, raise the dead and bring the thunder
[Chorus]
You've created a monster
I just keep getting stronger
Nightmare, I'm gonna haunt you
You've created a monster
I just keep getting stronger
Nightmare, I'm gonna haunt you
[Post-Chorus]
You've created a monster
You've created a monster
You've created a monster
[Verse 2]
Fighting, pushed me to the point of breaking
Biting, clawing for the crown of taking
[Chorus]
You've created a monster
I just keep getting stronger
Nightmare, I'm gonna haunt you
[Post-Chorus]
You've created a monster
You've created a monster
You've created a monster
[Bridge]
Look what you've done
Look what you've done
Look what you've done
Look what you've done
Look what you've done
Look what you've done
Look what you've done
You've created a monster
[Post-Chorus]
You've created a monster
You've created a monster
You've created a monster
You've created a monster
