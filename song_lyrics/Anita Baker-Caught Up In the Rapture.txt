[Verse 1]
When we met, always knew
I would feel that magic for you
On my mind constantly
In my arms is where you should be
[Pre-Chorus]
I love you here by me, baby
You let my love fly freely
I want you in my life for all time
[Chorus]
I’m caught up in the rapture of love
Nothing else can compare
When I feel the magic of you
[Verse 2]
We stand side by side
'Til the storms of life pass us by
Light my life, warm my heart
Say tonight will be just the start
[Pre-Chorus]
I love you here by me, baby
You let my love fly freely
I want you in my life for all time
