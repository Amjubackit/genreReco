[Intro: Shayley Bourget]
I believe it's time for me to be famous and out of place
I believe it's time for me to move forward when I break through
When I break through, when I break through
When I break through, when I break through
[Bridge: Austin Carlile & 
Shayley Bourget
]
This time I'll make you
Proud to see me over, come on, daylight
Proud of who you raised
Your shelter, your peacefulness
[Verse 1: Austin Carlile]
So this time I'll make you proud, proud of who you raised up
You know that I will always be here 'til the end
Come back, so I can say thank you for this
Home cooked meals and a place to rest
[Verse 2: Austin Carlile]
My troubled head when you're away
I've passed the test, I've earned an A
Not just in school, but in life
You'll always be right by my side
To help me show, hope to all
That are lost and sick in this dying world
I'll use the love you left behind
I'll change their minds, I'll change their minds[Pre-Chorus: Austin Carlile]
(I hope) I hope you smile when you look down on me
I hope you smile
This can't, we won't know
I hope that I make you proud
[Chorus: Shayley Bourget, 
Austin Carlile

This is not what it is, only baby scars (
Only baby scars
)
I need your love like a boy needs his mother's side (
I need your side
)
This is not what it is, only baby scars (
Baby scars
)
I need your love like a boy needs his 
mother's side
[Outro: Shayley Bourget]
This is not what it is, only baby scars
I need your love like a boy needs his mother's side, yeah
