[Intro]
(I say a little prayer for you)
[Verse 1]
The moment I wake up
Before I put on my makeup (Makeup)
I say a little (Prayer for you)
And while I'm combing my hair now
And wondering what dress to wear now (Wear now)
I say a little (Prayer for you)
[Chorus]
Forever (Forever), and ever (Yeah)
You'll stay in my heart and I will love you
Forever (Forever), and ever (Ever)
We never will part, oh, how I love you
Together (Together), together (Together)
That's how it must be to live without you
Would only mean heartbreak for me (Ooh-hoo)
[Verse 2]
I run for the bus, dear
But while riding I think of us, dear (Us, dear)
I say a little (Prayer for you)
And at work I just take time
And all through my coffee break time (Break time)
I say a little (Prayer for you)
