[Intro]
Hey girl, go on now
You know you've got 
everybody
 lookin'
[Verse 1]
Got a little boom in my big truck
Gonna open up the doors and turn it up
Gonna stomp my boots in the Georgia mud
Gonna watch you make me fall in love
Get up on the hood of my daddy's tractor
Up on the toolbox, it don't matter
Down on the tailgate, girl I can't wait
To watch you do your thing
[Pre-Chorus]
Shake it for the young bucks sittin' in the 
honky-tonks
For the rednecks rockin' 'til the break of dawn
For the DJ spinnin' that country song
Come on, come on, come on
Shake it for the birds, shake it for the bees
Shake it for the catfish swimmin' down deep in the creek
For the crickets and the critters and the squirrels
Shake it to the moon, shake it for me, girl, aww
[Chorus]
Country girl, shake it for me, girl
Shake it for me, girl, shake it for me
Country girl, shake it for me, girl
Shake it for me, girl, shake it for me
