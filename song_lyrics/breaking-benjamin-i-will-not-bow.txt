[Intro]
Fall
[Verse 1]
Now the dark begins to rise
Save your breath
It's far from over
Leave the lost and dead behind
Now's your chance to run for cover
I don't want to change the world
I just want to leave it colder
Light the fuse and burn it up
Take the path that leads to nowhere
[Pre-Chorus]
All is lost again
But I'm not giving in
[Chorus]
I will not bow
I will not break
I will shut the world away
I will not fall
I will not fade
I will take your breath away
