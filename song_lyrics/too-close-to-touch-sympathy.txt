[Verse 1]
Take a step inside my mind
As my eyes are open wide
In my sleep, I turn and toss
To rebuild the heart I lost
[Pre-Chorus]
You can tell me what you want
Fool me once and love was lost
Paper-thin; your words, they haunt my dreams
The seams have come undone
[Chorus]
Don't you dare say I'm gonna make it
'Cause I don't believe a word you say
Don't you dare say I'm gonna make it
'Cause I don't believe a word you say
There's a sickness living inside me
You can spare me all your sympathy
[Verse 2]
Take a second of your time
Realize you're wasting mine
In the night, I lie awake
Why rebuild a heart that breaks?[Pre-Chorus]
You can tell me what you want
Fool me once and love was lost
Paper-thin; your words, they haunt my dreams
The seams have come undone
[Chorus]
Don't you dare say I'm gonna make it
'Cause I don't believe a word you say
There's a sickness living inside me
You can spare me all your sympathy
Just spare me all your sympathy
[Verse 3]
I'm sitting waiting on the sun to rise
I know it never will
It comes as no surprise
So won't you stare into my hollow eyes?
They look so hungry now
It comes as no surprise
[Chorus]
Don't you dare say I'm gonna make it
'Cause I don't believe a word you say
There's a sickness living inside me
You can spare me all your sympathy
You can spare me all your sympathy
