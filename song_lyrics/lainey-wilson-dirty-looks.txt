[Verse 1]
I know it's been a long day, you been haulin’ that hay
You need a break from workin' in the sunshine
So you met me in here for a couple of beers
Just to wash away that overtime
[Pre-Chorus]
Now you're sayin’ that you wish you would've cleaned up
But you know I don't care about that
When you're leanin' in and kissin' me
And I can't stop kissin' you back
[Chorus]
Gettin’ dirty looks from people at the bar
Gettin’ dirty looks like, "Don't you know where you are?"
Gettin’ dirty looks like everybody's got somethin' to tell us
But they ain't nothin’ but jealous, baby
Somethin' 'bout rough hands on a hard-workin' man
I just wanna get all over you
Like the dirt on your shirt and your jeans and your boots
If you ask me, dirty looks...
Good on you, boy, good on you, boy
Good on you
[Verse 2]
Everyone in the room is like, "Y'all get a room"
We gon' do what we want to, let 'em stare
Keep 'em comin' like nobody's there
Baby, I don't care...[Chorus]
If we're gettin' dirty looks from people at the bar
Gettin' dirty looks like, "Don't you know where you are?"
Gettin' dirty looks like everybody's got somethin' to tell us
But they ain't nothin' but jealous, baby
Somethin' 'bout rough hands on a hard-workin' man
I just wanna get all over you
Like the dirt on your shirt and your jeans and your boots
If you ask me, dirty looks...
Good on you, boy, good on you, boy
Good on you, dirty looks...
(
Good on you, boy, good on you, boy
)
(
Good on you
)
[Pre-Chorus]
Now you're sayin' that you wish you would've cleaned up
But I kinda like it better when he don't
You're leanin' in and kissin' me
Baby, just take me home
[Chorus]
Gettin' dirty looks from people at the bar
Gettin' dirty looks like, "Don't you know where you are?"
Gettin' dirty looks like everybody's got somethin' to tell us
But aw, they're just jealous
Somethin' 'bout rough hands on a hard-workin' man
I just wanna get on you
Like the dirt on your shirt and your jeans and your boots
If you ask me, dirty looks...
Good on you, boy, good on you, boy
Good on you, dirty looks...
Good on you, boy, good on you, boy
Good on you, dirty looks...
