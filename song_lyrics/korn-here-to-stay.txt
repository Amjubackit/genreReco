[Verse 1]
This time, I'm taking it away
I've got a problem
With me getting in the way
Not by design
So I take my face
And bash it into a mirror
I won't have to see the pain
Pain, pain!
[Pre-Chorus]
This state is elevating
As the hurt turns into hating
Anticipating all the fucked up feelings again!
[Chorus]
The hurt inside is fading (aah-aah-aah)
This shit's gone way too far
All this time, I've been waiting
Oh, I cannot grieve anymore
For what's inside awaking (aah-aah-aah)
I'm not, I'm not a whore
You've taken everything and (aah-aah-aah)
Oh, I cannot give any more
[Verse 2]
My mind's done with this, okay?
I've got a question
Can I throw it all away?
Take back what's mine
So I take my time
Guiding the blade down the line
Each cut closer to the vein
Vein, vein
