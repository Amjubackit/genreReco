[Verse 1]
I was riding, riding on my bike
Me with my friend, we're so alike
[Refrain]
Am I all alone?
[Verse 2]
She said all we have is this
We just had to stop and share a kiss
[Refrain]
Am I all alone?
[Pre-Chorus]
One hot minute and I'm in it, come and get it
One hot minute and I'm in it, come and get it
One hot minute and I'm in it, come and get it
If I chase it, I might waste it, come and spin it
[Refrain]
Am I all alone?
Am I all alone?
[Chorus]
Sitting in the fire
Get along and have some fun
Floating to be higher
Maybe I'm your special one
Silent testifier
Breathe the moon and eat the sun
Sitting in the fire[Verse 3]
Close your eyes and click your heels
Can you believe how good it feels?
[Refrain]
Am I all alone?
[Pre-Chorus]
One hot minute and I'm in it, come and get it
One hot minute and I'm in it, come and get it
One hot minute and I'm in it, come and get it
If I chase it, I might waste it, come and spin it
[Refrain]
Am I all alone?
Am I all alone?
[Chorus]
Sitting in the fire
Get along and have some fun
Floating to be higher
Maybe I'm your special one
Silent testifier
Breathe the moon and eat the sun
Sitting in the fire[Bridge 1]
Say goodbye to where you buy you got it now
Pay your father, pay your twenty, take a bow
Say goodbye to where you buy you got it now
Pay your mama, pay your father, take a bow
Say goodbye to where you buy you got it now
Pay your father, pay your father, take a bow
[Bridge 2]
Three pounds of love inside my skull
A million more lives, it's never dull
Just a few times spun, spun around the sun
A couple more or less and then we're done
[Chorus]
Sitting in the fire
Get along and have some fun
Floating to be higher
Or maybe I'm your special one
Silent testifier
Breathe the moon and eat the sun
Sitting in the fire
