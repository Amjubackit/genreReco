[Verse 1]
Ain't nothing wrong with this chemistry
Ain't nothing wrong with this place for me
And time will tell the test of pedigree
Experience is another one meant for me
[Chorus]
To tell me now (tell me now)
And show me how (show me how)
To understand (understand)
What makes a good man?
To tell me now (tell me now)
And walk the line (walk the line)
And understand (understand)
What makes a good man?
[Post-Chorus]
Good man
Yeah!
[Verse 2]
Now I ain't tired of sweating for blood and dirt
I ain't tired of sweating for what it's worth
Cause lines get drawn and lines get kicked and blurred
Indelible, is what I need to spread the word[Chorus]
To tell me now (tell me now)
And show me how (show me how)
To understand (understand)
What makes a good man?
To tell me now (tell me now)
And walk the line (walk the line)
And understand (understand)
What makes a good man?
[Post-Chorus]
Good man
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
[Chorus]
To tell me now (tell me now)
And show me how (show me how)
To understand (understand)
What makes a good man?
To tell me now (tell me now)
And walk the line (walk the line)
And understand (understand)
What makes a good man?[Post-Chorus]
Good man
Good man
Good man
Good man
[Outro]
Good man
Good man
Good man
What makes a good man?
Good man
Good man
Good man
What makes a good man?
Good man
