[Verse 1]
Oh, how it hurts
Loving someone who has someone else
So many nights
I've spent here all alone by myself
Whenever you're with him, whose loving me, nobody
[Chorus]
Hurry up this way again
I love you, hurry up this way again
[Verse 2]
I'll never know when I'm going to see you again
Can't make no plans, I just see you whenever I can
What happens in between, I sit and dream about you
[Chorus]
Hurry up this way again
I love you, hurry up this way again
[Instrumental Break]
So many nights I spend here all alone
I love you, hurry up this way again
I need you, I want you, I don't want nobody else
Hurry up this way again
I love you, hurry up this way again
I love you, hurry up this way again
I've gotta have you, I want you, hurry up this way again
Hurry up this way again, I love you, hurry up this way again
