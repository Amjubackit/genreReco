[Intro: Charlotte Sands]
If I was just a lie to you
Well, you were less than that to me
Never loved you a little
[Verse 1: The Maine & Taking Back Sunday]
Bit by bit, you built this all in your head
And you knew goddamn well
Lays like these, they lean miss more than swing
And what made you think that what we had was love not meaningless?
And if I'm the fool, what's that make you?
[Pre Chorus: The Maine & Taking Back Sunday]
Don't tell me why (Don't tell me)
You can't sleep at night (You can't sleep)
I know now I won't ever do this again (I know now I)
(Won't ever do this again)
[Chorus: The Maine & Charlotte Sands]
If I was just a lie to you
Well, you were less than that to me
Never loved you a little
Loved you a little
Tell me who you were falling for
When we were lying on the floor
Never loved you a little[Verse 2: The Maine & Taking Back Sunday]
Try not to think of me at all
When you're lonely and exposed
All I really know is
Tales like these tragically end badly
Blame me, either way
I was too far gone to say
I'm tired, it's a little too late
[Pre-Chorus: The Maine & Taking Back Sunday]
If I'm the fool, then what are you?
Don't tell me why (Don't tell me)
You can't sleep at night (You can't sleep)
I know now I won't ever do this again (I know now I)
(I won't ever do this again)
[Chorus: The Maine & Charlotte Sands]
If I was just a lie to you
Well, you were less than that to me
Never loved you a little
Loved you a little
Tell me who you were falling for
When we were lying on the floor
Never loved you a little
Loved you a little
Never loved you a little
Loved you a little
I never loved you at all
At all (Loved you a little)[Bridge: The Maine & Charlotte Sands]
And what made you think that what we had was love?
And if I was the fool, then what does that make you?
What made you think that what we had was love?
And if I was the fool, then what does that make you?
And what made you think that what we had was love?
And if I was the fool, then what does that make you?
What made you think that what we had was love? (If I was just a lie to you)
And if I was the fool (Well, you were less than that to me)
Then what does that make you? (Never loved you a little)
Loved you a little (Yeah)
[Chorus: The Maine & Charlotte Sands]
Tell me who you were falling for
When we were lying on the floor
Never loved you a little
Loved you a little
If I was just a lie to you
Well, you were less than that to me
Never loved you a little
Loved you a little
Tell me who you were falling for
When we were lying on the floor
Never loved you a little
Loved you a little
