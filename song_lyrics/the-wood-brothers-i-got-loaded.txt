[Verse 1]
Last night
I got loaded
On a bottle of wine
A bottle of wine
Last night
I got loaded
On a bottle of wine
A bottle of wine
[Chorus]
But I feel alright
I feel alright
I feel alright
But I feel alright
[Verse 2]
The night before last
I got loaded
On a bottle of gin
A bottle of gin
The night before last
I got loaded
On a bottle of gin
A bottle of gin
[Chorus]
But I feel alright
I feel alright
I feel alright
Well I feel alright (I feel alright)
[break]
[Verse 3]
Well tonight
I might get loaded
On a bottle of whiskey
A bottle of whiskey
And tonight
I might get loaded
On a bottle of whiskey
A bottle of whiskey
[Chorus]
But I feel alright
I feel alright
I feel alright
Well I feel alright
[Outro]
And I feel alright
Well I feel alright
I feel alright
