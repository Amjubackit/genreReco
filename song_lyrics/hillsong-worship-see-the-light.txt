[Verse 1]
Arise my soul
Remember this
He took my sin
And He buried it
[Chorus]
No longer I who live
Now Jesus lives in me
For I was dead in sin
But I woke up to see the light
[Instrumental]
[Verse 2]
No I won't boast
But in the cross
That saved my soul
All else is loss
[Verse 3]
The grip of fear
Has no hold on me
So where o death
Where is your sting
[Chorus]
No longer I who live
Now Jesus lives in me
For I was dead in sin
But I woke up to see the light
[Instrumental]
[Bridge]
All
All of this for your glory
All
All of this for your glory
All
All of this for your glory
All
All of this for your glory
All
All of this for your glory
All
All of this for your glory
[Chorus]
No longer I who live
Now Jesus lives in me
For I was dead in sin
But I woke up to see the light
[Instrumental]
[Bridge]
All
All of this for your glory
All
All of this for your glory
All
All of this for your glory
All
All of this for your glory
