[Verse]
It had to be you
It had to be you
I wandered around and finally found
The somebody who
Could make me be true
Could make me be blue
Or even be glad just to be sad
Thinking of you
[Chorus]
Some others I've seen
Might never be mean
Might never be cross
Or try to be boss
But they wouldn't do
For nobody else gave me a thrill
With all your faults I love you still
It had to be you, wonderful you
It had to be you
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
Some others I've seen
Might never be mean
Might never be cross
Or try to be boss
They wouldn't do
For nobody else gave me a thrill
With all your faults I love you still
Baby, it had to be you, wonderful you
Had to be you
