[Verse 1]
Baby all I got is this beat up leather bag
And everything I own don't fill up half
But don't you worry about the way I pack
All I care about is getting back real soon
A goodbye kiss is all I need from you
[Chorus]
'Cause I'm carrying your love with me
West Virginia down to Tennessee
I'll be moving with the good Lord's speed
Carrying your love with me
It's my strength for holding on
Every minute that I have to be gone
I'll have everything I ever need
Carrying your love with me
[Verse 2]
On a lonely highway, stuck out in the rain
Darling all I have to do is speak your name
The clouds roll back and the waters part
The sun starts shining in my heart for you
You're right there in everything I do
[Chorus]
'Cause I'm carrying your love with me
West Virginia down to Tennessee
I'll be moving with the good Lord's speed
Carrying your love with me
It's my strength for holding on
Every minute that I have to be gone
I'll have everything I'll ever need
I'm carrying your love with me[Outro]
I'm carrying your love with me
West Virginia down to Tennessee
I'll be moving with the good Lord's speed
Carrying your love with me
