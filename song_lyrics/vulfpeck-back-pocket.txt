[Refrain]
I know
That it's taken me all this time to say girl
I'm slow
So it's taken me all this time to say girl
Tip toe
And I want to acknowledge my mistake girl
Uh oh
And I hope that you know it's not too late
[Hook]
Put it in my pocket
Put it in my pocket
In my back pocket
Put it in my pocket
In my pocket
In my back pocket
Oh oh oh
And I'll
Put it in my pocket
Put it in my pocket
In my back pocket
Put it in my pocket
In my pocket
In my back pocket
And I'll read it when I'm alone
