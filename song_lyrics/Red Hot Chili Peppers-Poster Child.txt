[Verse 1]
Melle Mel and Richard Hell were dancing at the Taco Bell
When someone heard a Rebel Yell, I think it was an infidel
Adam Ant
 and 
Robert Plant
, the banter of a sycophant
Enlisted by Ulysses Grant to record at the Record Plant
Islamabad is on the nod, Havana and the riot squad
And if you want to be a Mod, you'll have to meet me at the quad
[Refrain]
You got the best of my loco
I'll take the rest of your showboat
You got the best of my Yoko
I'll take the rest of your low note
[Verse 2]
Parliament's Atomic Dog, thе hats were filling up with fog
Talk about the lifе and death of every penny analogue
The seventies were such a win, singing the Led Zeppelin
Lizzy looking mighty Thin
, 
the Thomson's had another Twin
My daughter won the lottery, the numbers never thought of me
Ramones had a lobotomy, so spin me like your pottery
[Chorus]
I will be your poster child
You know, the world is ours for a little while
And then, I will be your poster child tonight, ow
La-da-da-da, ba-ba-ba-dum
