I was tryna strike shit like a match, late night, yeah
Strike like I missed it, strike like I hit the pin
Strike like I'm not goin' to work, strike, strike

Slide, slide, shoulders, huh, shoulders, uh
Stack them old hundreds, recreate Yoda (Hm, hm, hm)
I don't put no crushed ice in my soda (Hm, hm, hm)
Perky got her stuck like a holster, uh (Hm, hm, hm)
It's a gun in my holster (Hm, hm, hm, no stylist)
New Balenci' out in Dover (Hm, hm, hm, 220)
It's a four in my soda, sit it on a Balenci' coaster (Shh)
[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah (Mm, mm)
Okay (Yeah), okay, okay (Mm, mm, mm, mm)
