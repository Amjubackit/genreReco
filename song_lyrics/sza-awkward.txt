[Verse 1]
Time passing
Time, time passing
You wanted to know what the hype was all about
So I came by
Then we fucked a little bit and I was out
Did not say bye
[Chorus]
It was worth it (Ooh, it was)
I would do it again (Hey)
I know you hurt me, but (Hey)
This is more than a friendship
Now I made it awkward
Why did you let me do it?
I made it, I make it awkward (Hey, hey)
He wasn't ready for it (Hey, hey)
[Post-Chorus]
But can we still love on each other?
Can we still touch on each other?
Can we still not judge each other?
You know, you know
I make it awkward
[Verse 2]
I cannot love evеrybody, but you isn't anybody
You look at me different, so I lеt you see my body
(Body, body, body)
And now we don't speak at all
Now I regret it all
[Chorus]
Still, it was worth it
I would do it again
I know you hurt me, but
It is just deeper than friendship
Now let's keep it awkward
I think we're ready for it, yeah, mmm
Let's keep it awkward
I know I'm ready for it, you feel me?
[Outro]
Can we still love on each other?
Can we still touch on each other?
Can we still not judge each other?
