[Verse 1]
I was in the corner
Drinking from the punch
Yeah, you were in the kitchen
Cuttin’ up a rug
No need to complicate it
I had fallen in love
With you, so underrated
Something fillin’ up my lungs
[Refrain]
Every color of your love I’ve seen enough, I want another
Every color of your love I’ve seen enough, I want another
[Chorus]
Hey little mamma, when you talk back
I see your eyes light up
And I love that
I’m just a peach fuzz boy, I’m so alone
No, I don’t wanna miss you honey
Come home
[Verse 2]
Knock knock you’re coming over
Couple times a week
Hanging on my shoulder
Shaking like a leaf
