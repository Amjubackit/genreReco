[Chorus 1]
Lord, make me over
(Lord make me over)
Make me over, Jesus
(Lord make me over)
Lord, make me over
(Lord make me over...)
I can't be the same, I can't stay the same
Make me over, no-no-no-no-no, no-no
Please make me over
(Make me over again)
Yes make me over
(Make me over again)
[Verse]
I need a brand new start
(Make me over again)
Lord, I can't be the same way
(Make me over again)
Lord, create in me a clean heart
(Make me over again)
Lord, renew the right spirit in me
(Make me over again)
Lord, please don't pass me by
(Make me over again)
Lord, please don't pass me by
(Make me over again)
Again, again, I'm being made over
(Make me over again)
Again, won't You just wrap Your loving arms around me
(Make me over again)
Yeah, and tell me everything is gonna be alright
Oh baby, make me over
(Make me over again)
