[Intro: Daron Malakian]
You!
Why do they always send the poor?
[Verse 1: Serj Tankian]
Barbarisms by Barbaras with pointed heels
Victorious Victoriaâ€™s kneel for brand new spanking deals
Marching forward, hypocritic and hypnotic computers
You depend on our protection,
 
yet you feed us lies from the table cloth
[Chorus: Serj Tankian]
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, ooh-ooh
Everybody's going to the party, have a real good time
Dancing in the desert,
 
blowing up the sunshine
[Verse 2: Serj Tankian]
Kneeling roses disappearing into Moses' dry mouth
Breaking into Fort Knox, stealing our intentions
Hangars sitting dripped in oil, crying, "Freedom"
Handed to obsoletion,
 
still, you feed us lies from the table cloth
[Chorus: Serj Tankian 
with Daron Malakian
]
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, ooh-ooh
Everybody's going to the party, have a real good time
Dancing in the desert,
 
blowing up the sunshine
Everybody's going to the party, have a real good time
Dancing in the desert,
 
blowing up the sunshine
