[Verse 1]
I went lookin' at pictures I didn't wanna see
They brought back memories
You look happy, I guess, got the life that you wanted
But it ain't with me
You would think by now that I wouldn't care
It's been a couple years and, yeah, I've had my share
Of other broken-up hearts, but I only shed real tears over ours
[Chorus]
And now I'm in this cold bright light
And this don't even feel like life
'Cause I don't have the only woman who believed in me
Religiously
And now I'm in the back of the church
Prayin' just to stop the hurt
'Cause I don't have the only woman who was there for me
Religiously
[Verse 2]
Remember watchin' you play me our song on guitar
I thought I'd marry you
Act like I'm happier now, but all of my friends know
That ain't the truth
And lately life's been good to me
Mama's healthy and I'm helpin' out the whole family
Lotta people know my name, I made a little change
But that don't mean nothin'
