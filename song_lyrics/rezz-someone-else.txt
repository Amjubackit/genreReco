[Verse]
I wake up in the bed you made
The one where you're supposed to lay with me
I smell you on the pillowcase
But don't see your face, and that's okay with me
I never thought I'd see the day (See the day)
I'd see you as somebody I could hate
I guess that's just the price I pay
For the blood-red flags that I walked past every day
[Chorus]
Who are you when I'm not looking?
You're like an angel sent from hell
Despite those eyes that hooked me
When I'm not looking, you are someone else
[Drop]
Someone else
Someone—
[Chorus]
Who are you when I'm not looking?
I doubt you even know yourself
Despite those lies that took me
When I'm not looking, you are someone else[Bridge]
Hey
Is it me? Did I fly you away?
Am I wrong? Are you not who I say
?
If I call, which one of you will answer
Anyway?
[Chorus]
Who are you when I'm not looking?
You're like an angel sent from hell
Despite those eyes that hooked me
When I'm not looking, you are someone else
[Chorus]
Who are you when I'm not looking? (When I'm not looking)
I doubt you even know yourself
Despite those lies that took me
When I'm not looking, you are someone else
[Outro]
Someone—
When I'm not looking, you are someone else
