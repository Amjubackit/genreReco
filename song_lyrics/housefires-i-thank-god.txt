[Verse 1]
Wandering into the night
Wanting a place to hide
This weary soul, this bag of bones
And I try with all my might
But I just can't win the fight
I'm slowly drifting, a vagabond
[Pre-Chorus]
And just when I ran out of road
I met a Man I didn't know
And He told me that I was not alone (Not alone)
[Chorus]
He picked me up, and turned me around
And placed my feet on solid ground
I thank the Master, I thank the Savior
Because He healed my heart and changed my name
Forever free, I am not the same
I thank the Master, I thank the Savior
I thank God
[Verse 2]
I cannot deny what I see (No, no, no)
Got no choice but to believe
My doubts are burning, oh
Like ashes in the wind
So, so long to my old friends
Burden and bitterness
You can just keep it moving
For you ain't welcome here (Oh)
[Pre-Chorus]
From now 'til I walk the streets of gold
I'll sing of how You saved my soul
This wayward son has found His way back home
[Chorus]
He picked me up, He turned me around
He placed my feet on solid ground
I thank the Master, I thank the Savior
Because He healed my heart (He healed my heart)
And changed my name
Forever free, I am not the same
I thank the Master, I thank the Savior
I thank God
[Bridge]
Hell lost another one
I am free (I am free)
Oh, I am free (Oh, I am free)
Oh, I am free
Hell lost another one
I am free (Oh, I am free)
I am free (I am free)
Oh, I am free
Hell lost another one
I am free (I am free)
Oh, I am free
Yes, I am free
Hell lost another one
I am free
Oh, I am free, yeah
[Chorus]
He picked me up (He picked me up)
He turned me around
He placed my feet on solid ground
I thank the Master, I thank the Savior
Because He healed my heart (He healed my heart)
He changed my name
Forever free, I'm not the same
I thank the Master, I thank the Savior
I thank God
[Outro]
Get up, get up, get up
Get up outta that grave
Get up, get up, get up
Get up outta that grave
Get up, get up, get up
Get up outta that grave
Get up, get up, get up
Get up outta that grave
