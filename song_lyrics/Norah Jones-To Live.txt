[Intro]
Ooh
Ooh
[Chorus]
To live in this moment
And finally be free
Is what I was after
No chains holding me
If love is the answer
In front of my face
Then I'll live in this moment
And find my true place
[Verse 1]
These cracks in my heart
Can't be filled with cement
Can't find or use up
All the time that I've spent
I want a life in color
To breathe outside the lines
To live in this moment
Find peace in my mind
[Refrain]
Ooh
Ooh
