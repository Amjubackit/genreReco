[Verse]
If it's love that you want
I'll give my everything
And have I made the right assumption?
Do you feel the same?
If it's love that you want
I'll give my everything
And have I made the right assumption?
Do you feel the same?
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse]
If it's love that you want
I'll give my everything
And have I made the right assumption?
Do you feel the same?
If it's love that you want
I'll give my everything
And have I made the right assumption?
Do you feel the same?
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse]
Love that you want
I'll give my everything
And have I made the right assumption?
Do you feel the same?
If it's love that you want
I'll give my everything
And have I made the right assumption?
Do you feel the same?
