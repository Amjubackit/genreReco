[Verse 1: Tom DeLonge 
with Mark Hoppus
]
I ain't that cool, a little fucked in the head
They'll be hangin' me quick when I'm back from the dead
Get the rope, get the rope
Get the rope, get the rope
I'm a punk rock kid, I came from hell with a curse
She tried to pray it away, so I fucked her in church
Don't you know? Don't you know?
Don't you know? Yeah, don't you know?
[Pre-Chorus: Tom DeLonge]
They say, "You're not safe here if I stay
With a knife that sharp, no way"
[Chorus: Tom DeLonge & 
Mark Hoppus
]
No, I leave them broken-hearted
Oh no, look at thе mess we started
Oh no, I lеad the broken hearts this way (
This way
)
Whatcha say? (
Whatcha say?
) Wanna play?
[Verse 2: Mark Hoppus]
Yea, don't be fooled, I'm only lettin' you down
They pursued me on foot, but I hid in the crowd
Like a ghost, like a ghost
Like a ghost, like a ghost
The seats of my car are filled with cigarette burns
I got a fire in my eye, a little blood on my shirt
Let's hit the road, hit the road
Hit the road, hit the road
