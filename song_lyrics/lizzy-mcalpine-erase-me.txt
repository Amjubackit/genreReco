[Verse 1: Lizzy McAlpine]
Why am I awake?
Nails on the floor and soot on my tongue
I don't know his name, but I still taste the rum (Rum, rum, rum, rum)
Nothing there but skin
Skeletons crawl on the ceiling, they know
That him and his aftershave hit like a drug
 (Drug, drug, hmm)
[Chorus: Lizzy McAlpine & Jacob Collier]
Don’t answer me, I'm callin' just to hear you scream
And you’re fadin', but he feels like you in between
I've said too much, in and out of wantin' us
Now, you're fadin' and I wonder who will erase me?
Who will erase me? Mmm
[Verse 2: Lizzy McAlpine]
Race you to the end (Ohh-woah)
My innocence waits like it desperately knows
That I'll crash if I don't lеt you go (Go)
[Chorus: Lizzy McAlpine & Jacob Collier]
Don’t answer me, I’m callin' just to hear you scrеam
And you’re fadin', but he feels like you in between
I've said too much, in and out of wantin' us
Now, you’re fadin' and I wonder who will erase me?[Bridge: Lizzy McAlpine]
Erase me?
Erase me?
And I wonder who will erase me?
[Chorus: Lizzy McAlpine & Jacob Collier]
Don't answer me, I'm callin' just to hear you scream
And you're fadin', but he feels like you in between
I've said too much, in and out of wantin' us
Now, you're fadin' (
Fadin'
) and I wonder who will erase?
Don't answer me, I'm callin' just to hear you scream (Scream)
And you're fadin' (
Fadin'
), but he feels like you in between
And I've said too much, in and out of wantin' us (
In and out of wantin' us
)
Now, you're fadin' and I wonder who will erase me?
Oh, who will erase me?
