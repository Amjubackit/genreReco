[Intro: Anthony Brown]Lead
You thought I was worth saving
So you came and changed my life
You thought I was worth keeping
So you cleaned me up inside
You thought I was to die for
So you sacrificed your life
So I could be free
So I could be whole
So I could tell everyone I know
[Chorus: group Therapy]
You thought I was worth saving
So you came and changed my life
You thought I was worth keeping
So you cleaned me up inside
You thought I was to die for
So you sacrificed your life
So I could be free
So I could be whole
So I could tell everyone I know
You thought I was worth saving
So you came and changed my life
You thought I was worth keeping
So you cleaned me up inside
You thought I was to die for
So you sacrificed your life
So I could be free
So I could be whole
So I could tell everyone I know
You thought I was worth saving
So you came and changed my life
You thought I was worth keeping
So you cleaned me up inside
(So you cleaned me up inside)
You thought I was to die for
So you sacrificed your life
So I could be free
So I could be whole
So I could tell everyone I know
[Bridge:]
Hallelujah
Glory to the God who changed my life

Because I am whole
And I will tell everyone I know
[Outro: Anthony Brown]
You thought I was worth saving
So you came and changed my life
You thought I was worth keeping
So you cleaned me up inside
You thought I was to die for
You thought I was to die for
You thought I was to die for
You thought I, you thought I
You thought I was to die for
You sacrificed your life
So I can be free
Hallelujah
