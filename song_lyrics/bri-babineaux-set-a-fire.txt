[Chorus]
Set a fire down in my soul
That I can't contain
I can't control
I want more of you God
I need more of you
Set a fire down in my soul
That I can't in saying
I can't control because
I want more of you God
I need more of you God
(Set a fire down in my soul)
(That I can't contain)
(I can't control)
(I want more of you God)
(I need more of you)
(No place I'd rather be)...
