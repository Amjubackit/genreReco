[Intro]
Woah-oah-oh-ohhhh-oh-oh
Woah-oah-oh-oaahhhh
Woah-oah-oh-ohhhh-oh-oh
Woah-oah-oh-oaahhhh
[Verse 1]
Life just sucks when all you know is the bottom
It's not your choice, there's no escaping it
Get up and run as far as you can
Head to higher ground while there's a chance to live
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't run away, run away, runaway
Don't run away, run away, runaway (Run!)
[Chorus]
Up on the mountain I see down below
It's easy to lose yourself I know
Can't hear what you're shouting, I'm deaf to your show
It's easy to lose your self control
Everybody gets high, everybody gets low
Life can be such overdose
Up on the mountain I see down below
It's easy to lose yourself I know
In the in between
