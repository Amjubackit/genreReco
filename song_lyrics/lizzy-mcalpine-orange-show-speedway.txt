[Verse 1]
Every guy at this festival has you in their eyes
I never think about it too much, but I'm thinking tonight
And it's really annoying that I'm triggered like this
'Cause your name isn't spoken, but I'm speaking it
And I don't know why it happened, but it happened like this
[Pre-Chorus]
My best friends are with me and I feel okay
The last time I was here, I was eighteen
My mind is racing and I feel so strange
Last time I was here, you were with me
[Chorus]
I fell in love at the 
Orange Show Speedway
It didn't look like this three years ago
I had it all at the Orange Show Speedway
Or someplace like that, it all looks the same
Everything changes, 
what a shame
[Verse 2]
I'm in the middle of the crowd and it's like no time's passed
I'm half-expecting you to be there when I turn to my left
We were stupid and young and I was so in love
We were just friends riding on the line between acceptable
And angering your girlfriend[Pre-Chorus]
My best friends are with me and I feel okay
The last time I was here, I was eighteen
My mind is racing and I feel so strange
Last time I was here, you were with me
[Chorus]
I fell in love at the Orange Show Speedway
It didn't look like this three years ago
I had it all at the Orange Show Speedway
Or someplace like that, it all looks the same
Everything changes, 
what a shame
[Break]
Uh, yep, ooh, fireworks
This is the best voice memo diary to date I think (
This is amazing
)
Just wanted to update myself
No one else listens to these but myself
(
Hey
), okay (
You got 
the firework
s if you put that in a song
)
[Outro]
I fell in love at the Orange Show Speedway
But I've never been here in my life
I think it all kinda feels like an Orange Show Speedway
When you're racing head-first towards something that'll kill you in five seconds flat
When I'm racing head-first towards everything that I want back
