[Verse 1]
God, I’m cavin' in to Your beckoning
I can sense the call of Your Spirit
It’s a still small voice, but I hear it
[Verse 2]
Lead me in Your ways, breathe upon my faith
There’s a place where there are no limits
And You won’t relent 'till I’m in it
[Pre-Chorus]
You don’t want a surface relationship
You want more than this
[Chorus]
Take me on a deep dive, deep dive into Your heart
Show me every detail, unveil all that You are
All that You are
[Interlude]
Come and show us
Every part of Your heart
We sing this
[Verse 3]
Into the unknown, Father, come and show
That Your Spirit’s nеver been hiding
It’s the faithful ones that keep finding[Pre-Chorus]
I don’t want a surfacе relationship
I want more than this
[Chorus]
Take me on a deep dive, deep dive into Your heart
Show me every detail, unveil all that You are
Take me on a deep dive, deep dive into Your heart
Show me every detail, unveil all that You are
All that You are, yes
All that You are, all that You are
Oh, new hearts and new depths
[Bridge]
Show me what’s breaking Your heart
Even if it messes me up
'Cause I don’t wanna know You in part
I wanna know You, really know You
Don't wanna reach the end of my life
Knowing there was more I could find
Oh, I don’t wanna know You in part
I wanna know You, really know You (C'mon)
Show me what’s breaking Your heart
Even if it messes me up
'Cause I don’t wanna know You in part
I wanna know You, really know You
Don't wanna reach the end of my life
Knowing there was more I could find
I don’t wanna know You in part
I wanna know You, really know You (Yes, we do)I wanna know You, really know You
I wanna love You, really love You
I wanna love You, really love You
Oh, really love You, yeah, really love You
[Outro]
Take me on a deep dive, deep dive into Your heart
Show me every detail, unveil all that You are
Take me on a deep dive, deep dive into Your heart
Show me every detail, unveil all that You are
All that You are
Yes, Lord
All that You are, all that You are
We want it all, Jesus
