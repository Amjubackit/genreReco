[Verse 1]
I'm digging with my fingertips
I'm ripping at the ground I stand upon
I'm searching for fragile bones (Evolution)
I'm never gonna be refined
Keep trying, but I won't assimilate
Sure, we have come far in time
(Watch the bow break)
[Pre-Chorus 1]
And I'm sorry I don't believe
By the evidence that I see
That there's any hope left for me
It's evolution, just evolution
[Chorus 1]
And I, I do not dare deny
The basic beast inside
It's right here, it's controlling my mind
And why do I deserve to die?
I'm dominated by this animal that's locked up inside
[Verse 2]
Close up to get a real good view
I'm betting that the species will survive
Pull back, I'm getting inside you
(Evolution)
And when we're gonna find these bones
They're gonna wanna keep them in a jar
The number one virus caused by (Procreation)[Pre-Chorus 2]
And the planet may go astray
In a million years, I say
Those motherfuckers were all deranged
It's evolution, just evolution
[Chorus 1]
And I, I do not dare deny
The basic beast inside
It's right here, it's controlling my mind
And why do I deserve to die?
I'm dominated by this animal thatâ€™s locked up inside
[Bridge]
Take a look around (Take a look around, take a look around, take a look around, take a look around, take a look around)
Nothing much has changed
 (Take a look around, take a look around, take a look around, take a look around)
Take a look around (Take a look around, take a look around, take a look around, take a look around, take a look around)
Nothing much has changed
 (Take a look around, take a look around, take a look around, take a look around!)
Take a look around
Take a look around
Take a look around (Nothing much has changed)
Take a look around
Take a look around (Nothing much has changed)
Take a look around
Take a look around (Nothing much has changed)
Take a look around[Chorus 2]
I, I do not dare deny
The basic beast inside
It's right here, it's controlling my mind
And why do I deserve to die?
I'm dominated by this animal that's locked up inside
[Outro]
Why?
Why do I deserve to die?
