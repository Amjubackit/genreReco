[Verse 1]
Now, I'm the king of the swingers, uh
The jungle VIP
I've reached the top and had to stop
And that's what's botherin' me
I wanna be a man, man-cub
And stroll right into town
And be just like the other men
I'm tired of monkeyin' around
[Chorus]
Ooh, I wanna be like you
I wanna walk like you
Talk like you, too
You'll see it's true
An ape like me
Can learn to be
Human too
[Verse 2]
Now, don't try to kid me, man-cub
And don't get in a stew
What I desire is man's red fire
So I can be like you
Now gimme the secret, man-cub
Just clue me what to do
Give me the power of man's red flower
And make my dreams come true
[Verse 3]
Now I will ape your mannerisms
And we'll be a set of twins
No one will know
Where man-cub ends and orangutan begins
And when I eat bananas
I won't peel them with my feet
'Cause I'll become a man
Man-cub and learn some etiquette
[Chorus]
Ooh, I wanna be like you
I wanna walk like you
Talk like you, too
You'll see it's true
An ape like me
Can learn to be
Human too
[Outro]
Can learn to be
Human too
I wanna be like you
I wanna feel human, too
