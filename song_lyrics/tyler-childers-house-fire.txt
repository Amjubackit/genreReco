[Chorus]
You can set my house on fire, baby
You can turn it into cinder and smoke
'Cause this house is mighty cold and I feel like
Melting all the snow away
[Verse 1]
You see these boots I'm wearing
They're tough enough to go
And they will take many a road to reach you
Honey, won't you light the way?
[Chorus]
You can set my house on fire, baby
You can turn it into cinder and smoke
'Cause this house is mighty cold and I feel like
Melting all the snow away
[Verse 2]
You see this train I'm riding
It's burnin' up the coal
And its wheels are bound to roll right by you
Honey, won't you jump my train?
[Chorus]
You can set my house on fire, baby
You can turn it into cinder and smoke
'Cause this house is mighty cold and I feel like
Melting all the snow away[Chorus]
You can set my house on fire, baby
You can turn it into cinder and smoke
'Cause this house is mighty cold and I feel like
Melting all the snow away
You can set my house on fire, baby
