Verse 1
End of a road, is never fully towed; but it ends
Fulfillment of a dream is more than it seems will the scars last
Will the pain past?
People only see the smiles
They're unaware of all the trials one must endure
Just because he's sure, he is right
So he fights through the night it goes on
Don't know when the day will break
When his heart won't ache or this song will end
Verse 2
Lofty goals can consume one's soul and often will, it often will
Yet there is no pause until he accomplishes the cause
One of no good deed, driven to succeed
What's the real price of success
And this feeling of emptiness left in its quake
Discerning the truth from the fake
Is the test and though it hurts yet never the less
At this pain I must wink
From this bitter cup I'll drink until this song, until it ends
And every night I'd pray Lord let this cup pass
Because I really didn't know how long it was last
Every week I'd feel the same pain
Residue of hurt would come again and again
Then all of a sudden your life came
Now I'm over it now, over it now, I can't say how, but I'm it over now
One morning I broke free all of the chains just dropped off of me
People can talk about me much as they please
But I'm all grown up know I've got the victory
But I'm over it now, over it now, I can't say how, it's over now
But I'm over it now, over it now, I can't say how, it's over now
Don't know what I ought to do
But I know that I'll get through this song it will end
