[Intro]
She's not of this earth
Diving head first, oh yeah
She's thick like my syrup
She's my dessert, mm, yeah
[Chorus]
Crash land on the moon
Make love on the moon
Bring life to the moon, yeah
Bring life to the moon
Bring life to the night
Come alive in the night
Do you have any visitors?
I wanna visit you
I flip you around and I finish
Have any visitors?
I wanna visit you
I wanna visit you
[Verse 1]
And I travel like Elon
'Cause it took me eons to see you

Ain't gotta put my feet on it either
Heard there was hating on me
How do they see me from those seats
Police on my tail give me scoliosis

Do you have any visitors?
I wanna visit you
I flip you around and I finish
Have any visitors?
I wanna visit you
I wanna visit you, yeah
[Verse 2]
She take [?]
She walk barefoot in my castle
I told her the bitches are guarded
From there she take one bite from my apple
She want me to like her the way that she like me
It's more likely she win a raffle
Her heart broke beyond repair
I dive in from the air
[Pre-Break]
Bring life to the moon
Make love on the moon
Bring life to the moon
[Break]
Bring life to the--
[Outro]
Crash land on the moon
Crash land on the moon
Make love on the moon
Make life on the moon
