[Intro]
Wet my whistle
Wet my whistle
Wet my whistle
[Verse 1]
Just like sweet wine, baby
Your love's intoxicatin'
Why'd I have to taste it? Mmm
'Cause it's much too good to waste it
So baby, let me love you
And I'll place no one above you
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm hooked, baby, on your love
Just because
[Chorus]
I just had to wet my whistle
When I kissed your lips, girl
I couldn't get enough
I had to wet my whistle
Just a little bit, baby
Was much too much
Wet my whistle
[Verse 2]
First, I was only playin'
Now look where love is layin'
So softly on my pillow, little girl
I'll never ever let you go (No, no, no)
Love was never on my mind
I thought I'd better take my time
But girl, you drive me crazy
(You're such a real fine lady) You're so fine
[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm hooked, baby, on your love
Yes, I'm hooked, baby, I just can't get enough
Said I'm hooked, baby, on your love
Just because
[Chorus]
I just had to wet my whistle
When I kissed your lips, girl
I couldn't get enough
I had to wet my whistle
Just a little bit, baby
Was much too much
I had to wet my whistle
When I kissed your lips, girl
I couldn't get enough
I had to wet my whistle
Just a little bit, baby
Was much too much
Wet my whistle (Yeah, yeah)
[Bridge]
(Just a little bit) Ooh
(Just a little bit) Baby
(A little bit, baby) Just a little bit
(Just a little bit) On your love
(Just a little bit) Baby
(A little bit, baby) Whoa, whoa
(Just a little bit) Baby
(Just a little bit) Baby
(A little bit, baby) Whoa, whoa
(Just a little bit) Ooh baby
(Just a little bit) Ooh baby, yeah
(A little bit, baby)
[Chorus]
I just had to wet my whistle
When I kissed your lips, girl
I couldn't get enough
I had to wet my whistle
Just a little bit, baby
Was much too much
I had to wet my whistle
Oh, when I kissed your lips, baby
You know how to drive me crazy
(Wet my whistle) Oh, oh
(Just a little bit, baby) Was much too much
(Wet my whistle)
I just had to wet my whistle
