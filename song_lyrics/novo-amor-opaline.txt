[Verse 1]
I knew I’d have a bad time shaking you
On the form, I’m naming who?
With the crack sound of my tooth
Coming loose
[Pre-Chorus]
It was all so complicated
I didn’t mean to say it out loud
Anyway then, I think I should go
Exaggerate it
All my heart is breaking
I can’t overstate it
[Chorus]
How should I be feeling?
So run the red out
The ceiling is all coming down
And I feel I should care but I don’t
Mean to (So run the red out)
Be rude (It’s all coming down)
Now I feel like I’m finally me
[Verse 2]
I know, I could’ve said I was feeling low
But I’m here just to hold your coat
I’ve been thinking I could stay at home
[Pre-Chorus]
It was all so complicated
I didn’t mean to say it out loud
Anyway then, I think I should go
Be evaporated
All my heart is breaking
I can’t overstate it
[Chorus]
How should I be feeling?
So run the red out
The ceiling is all coming down
And I feel I should care but I don’t
Mean to (So run the red out)
Be rude (It’s all coming down)
Now I feel like I’m finally me
