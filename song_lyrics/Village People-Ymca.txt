[Verse 1]
Young man, there's no need to feel down, I said
Young man, pick yourself off the ground, 
I said
Young man, 'cause you're in a new town
There's no need to be unhappy
Young man, there's a place you can go
, 
I said
Young man, when you're short on your dough
 you can
Stay there and I'm sure you will find
Many ways to have a good time
[Chorus]
It's fun to stay at the 
Y.M.C.A.
 
It's fun to stay at the Y.M.C.A.
 
They have everything for young men to enjoy
You can hang out with all the boys
It's fun to stay at the 
Y.M.C.A.
 
It's fun to stay at the 
Y.M.C.A.
 
You can get yourself clean, you can have a good meal
You can do whatever you feel
[Verse 2]
Young man, are you listening to me? I said
Young man, what do you want to be? I said
Young man, you can make real your dreams
But you've got to know this one thing
No man does it all by himself, I said
Young man, put your pride on the shelf
And just go there, to the Y.M.C.A. 
I'm sure they can help you today
