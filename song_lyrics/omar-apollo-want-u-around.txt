[Chorus: Omar Apollo]
Baby, I want you around
And, baby, I want you around
[Verse 1: Omar Apollo]
I'm done with you
And baby, I promise, I'll be what you wanted
But now, and here
Heart took some damage, I wish I could vanish from
[Pre-Chorus: Omar Apollo]
You
You
You
You
[Chorus: Omar Apollo & 
Ruel
]
And baby, I want you around (
Baby, baby
)
(
I want you around
) Baby, I want you around
[Verse 2: Omar Apollo]
I'm missin' you
Took me for granted, ain't that what you wanted?
And I'll disappear
Told me you promise, I can't even stand it[Pre-Chorus: Omar Apollo]
You (I miss you, baby)
You (Oh)
You (Miss you, oh, miss you, miss you)
You
[Chorus: Omar Apollo & 
Ruel
]
And baby, I want you around (
Baby, baby
)
(
I want you around, I want you around
)
Baby, I want you around
[Verse 3: Ruel]
Baby, I need you to notice me (Oh, oh)
See your name on my phone 'fore I go to sleep (Oh, oh)
Are you tryin' to push me away? (Oh, oh, oh)
What else are you tryna gain? (Oh, oh, oh)
Oh, oh, oh
[Bridge: Omar Apollo]
Say what you want about me
Oh, say what you want about me, yeah
Woah (Oh)
[Chorus: Omar Apollo & Ruel, 
Ruel
]
Baby, I want you around (
Want you around
)
And, baby, I want you around (
Want you around
)[Outro: Ruel]
Want you around (Oh, oh)
Want you around (Yeah, yeah)
Ooh (Ooh-ooh)
