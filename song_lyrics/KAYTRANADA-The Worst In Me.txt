[Intro]
Oh yeah
Ooh, woah, ooh
Oh, nah, nah
[Verse 1]
You make me a mess, oh
Never meant to love you so, no
Played with my emotions
Falling for you don't make no sense
[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh, never could have cried so easily
You, ooh-ooh, always get away with everything
I can't believe that I let, let you in
Once again, and again, and again, oh, no, no
[Chorus]
Every time I fuck, fight, we scream (All night)
I thought it was (This ain't how it's supposed to be)
That means I feel (Something)
I want your love (You bring out the worst in me)
Oh me, oh me, oh me
Oh me, oh me (This ain't how it's supposed to be)
Oh me, oh me, I believe
Oh me, oh me (You bring out the worst in me)
