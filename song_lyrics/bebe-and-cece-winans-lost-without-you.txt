[Verse 1: BeBe Winans & 
CeCe Winans
]
Day by day, normal reaction
You are my center attraction
Every beat my heart beat is your song
From hurt and harm, you're my protection
The path I take is your direction
'Cause I know with you, I can't go wrong
[Pre-Chorus: CeCe Winans]
Ever since that day I asked you into my heart
My world has changed so promise me you'll never part
[Chorus: BeBe & CeCe Winans, 
BeBe
, 
CeCe
]
'Cause I'm lost without you
Easy to see
I'm lost without you
And there's no letting go
So let me be the first to say
I'm lost without you
So don't ever go, go away
Said don't ever go away
[Verse 2: BeBe Winans & 
CeCe Winans
]
You pick me up those times I'm down
You make me laugh when there's no clown
No one else can love me like you do
Heaven knows that I'll proclaim
The love I feel when I hear your name
There's no substitution quite the same[Pre-Chorus: BeBe Winans]
Now some say I'm crazy and I'm acting insane
But there's no life without you so I'll stake my claim, oh
[Chorus: BeBe & CeCe Winans, 
BeBe
, 
CeCe
]
I'm lost without you
It's easy to see
I'm lost without you
So I just keep holding on
So let me be the first to say
I'm lost without you
So don't ever go
, 
don't ever go
, 
go away
Na-na-na, go away, hey
[Bridge: 
BeBe Winans
 & 
CeCe Winans
]
Can you tell them about love?
Love is sweet and love is kind
Love will bring you peace of mind
And how do you know?
Well, I'll tell you so
He won't ever go
Oh no, He won't ever
[Outro: BeBe Winans]
Now, that's what I love about Him
Huh, that's what I love about Him, oh yeah
Hey, 'cause He won't ever go away
No, said He won't ever go away
Hey, hey, hey, hey, I'm lost without His love
