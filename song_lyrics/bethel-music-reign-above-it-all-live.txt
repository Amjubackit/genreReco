[Verse 1]
The reign of darkness now has ended
In the kingdom of light
In the kingdom of light
Forever under Your dominion
You're the King of my life
You're the King of my life
[Chorus]
You reign above it all, You reign above it all
Over the universe and over every heart
There is no higher name
Jesus, You reign above it all
[Verse 2]
On the cross, the work was finished
God, You poured out Your life
Just to give us new life
Now from the lips of the forgiven
Hear an anthem arise
'Cause, Jesus, You're alive, oh
[Chorus]
You reign above it all, You reign above it all
Over the universe and over every heart
There is no higher name
Jesus, You reign above it all
Let all of Heaven and the Earth erupt in song
Sing Hallelujah to the Everlasting One
There is no higher name
Jesus, You reign above it all
Yes, You reign above it all[Bridge]
You sent the darkness running out of an empty grave
Now seated alone in glory, enthroned on the highest praise
You sent the darkness running out of an empty grave
Now seated alone in glory, enthroned on the highest praise
Come on, sing it
You sent the darkness running out of an empty grave
Now seated alone in glory, enthroned on the highest praise
You sent the darkness running out of an empty grave
Now seated alone in glory, enthroned on the highest praise
You sent the darkness running out of an empty grave
Now seated alone in glory, enthroned on the highest praise
You sent the darkness running out of an empty grave
Now seated alone in glory, enthroned on the highest praise
[Chorus]
You reign above it all, You reign above it all, hey
Over the universe and over every heart
There is no higher name
Jesus, You reign above it all
Let all of Heaven and the Earth erupt in song
Sing Hallelujah to the Everlasting One
There is no higher name
Jesus, You reign above it all
You reign above it all
Yes, You reign above it all
Yeah, You reign above it all[Interlude]
Yes, You reign above it all
High and lifted up
You reign above it all
Yes, You do
You reign, come on, sing it
[Outro]
Yes, You reign above it all, You reign above it all
Well, over the universe and over every heart
There is no higher name
Jesus, You reign above it all
And let all of Heaven and the Earth erupt in song
Sing Hallelujah to the Everlasting One
'Cause there is no higher name
Jesus, You reign above it all
