[Verse 1]
I watch the snowflakes fall
Against my window pane
And wonder if you
Are watching snowflakes, too
I take a walk downtown
To where you used to meet me
There's joy everywhere
But all that's waiting there is
[Chorus]
Just a little Christmas tree
Looking sorta sad and lonely just like me
No one seems to care
They just went away and left it standing there
All alone on Christmas Eve
[Verse 2]
I hear the Christmas bells
(Bum Bum Bum)
The happy people singing
The songs of good cheer that only brings me tears
I sadly close my eyes
And say a liitle prayer
You'll be waiting there for me
I look but all I see is[Chorus]
Just a little Christmas tree
Looking sorta sad and lonely just like me
No one seems to care
They just went away and left it standing there
All alone on Christmas Eve
[Bridge]
This is the season of love
(This is the season of love)
But I'm as sad as I can be
(Bu I'm as sad as can be)
Why did you have to leave me?
(Why did you leave me? Why did you leave me?)
[Chorus]
Just a little Christmas tree
Looking sorta sad and lonely just like me
No one seems to care
They just went away and left it standing there
All alone on Christmas Eve
