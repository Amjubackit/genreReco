Call him when you want him
Look at myself in the mirror
Religion lookin' back at me
I threw my hands in the air
And the law arrested me
Girl interrupted
I needed to break out and get freedom
One bad decision after the next
Just getting by, letting you figure me
Jesus, call him when you want him
Call him when you need him
But Jesus yeah Jesus yeah
Jesus, oh Jesus, yeah
Curses unbroken
Still holding me down
Bondage, I was even thinking
I wasn't good enough for God's best
But I'm in my closet
Yes I am, I'm in my closet
Time after time
Praying Jesus, singing Jesus, crying Jesus
