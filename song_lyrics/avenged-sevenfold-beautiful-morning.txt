[Verse 1: M. Shadows]
I sit stoic, 
touch of the divine upon my neck
Lay me gently - take my body down let me ascend
Help me to hear, and hear me to save, and save me before I've gone too far
Let me inhale my passage to hell while slowly exhaling the scar
[Refrain: M. Shadows]
You walk on water but the water swallows you
[Verse 2: M. Shadows]
I lay quiet, floating in the stillness of this tomb
Headstone empty, choking on the flowers as they bloom
No one to know and no whеre to hide and 
nothing of me I'vе left behind
Silence of one the meaning of none and letting it all go to me
[Chorus: M. Shadows]
You walk on water, but the water swallows you
And you're like no other, you're the other one in view
Don't let it be, don't let it be, don't let it
[Bridge: Synyster Gates,

It's a beautiful morning, it's a beautiful day, everybody is smiling in a beautiful way
I took a walk to paint the flowers and the trees
The sun reflected gazing fondly on me
I made a picture and I put it in the rays outside
It washed the paint away and carried me home
I have finally arrived
There's no one but you... two[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3: M. Shadows]
Dressed in armor - just the hollow shell I was before
Help me to turn my attention on me so empty just as I was before
Let me exhale concession to hell while slowly embracing the scar
[Chorus: M. Shadows]
You walk on water, but the water swallows you
And you're like no other, you're the other one in view
(Don't let it be, don't let it be, don't let it)
You walk on water, but the water swallows you
And you're like no other, you're the other one in view
(Don't let it be, don't let it be, don't let it be)
