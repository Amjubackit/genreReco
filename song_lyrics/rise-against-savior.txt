[Verse 1]
It kills me not to know this
But I've all but just forgotten
What the color of her eyes were
And her scars or how she got them
As the telling signs of age rain down
A single tear is droppin'
Through the valleys of an aging face
That this world has forgotten
[Verse 2]
There is no reconciliation
That will put me in my place
And there is no time like the present
To drink these draining seconds
But seldom do these words ring true
When I'm constantly failing you
Walls that we just can't break through
Until we disappear
[Pre-Chorus]
So, tell me now, if this ain't love
Then how do we get out? â€™Cause I don't know
[Chorus]
That's when she said, "I don't hate you, boy, I just want to save you
While there's still something left to save!" (Whoa-oh-oh, Whoa-oh-oh!)
That's when I told her, "I love you, girl, but I'm not the answer
For the questions that you still have!"
Whoa-oh-oh, Whoa-oh-oh!
