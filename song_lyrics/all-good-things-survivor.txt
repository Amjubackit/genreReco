[Verse 1]
Now that you're out of my life, I'm so much better
Thought that I'd be weak without you, but I'm stronger
Thought that I'd be broke without you, but I'm richer
Thought that I'd be sad without you, I laugh harder
Thought I wouldn't grow without you, now I'm wiser
I'd be helpless without you, but I'm smarter
Thought that I'd be stressed without you, but I'm chillin'
Thought I wouldn't sell without you, sold nine million
[Chorus]
I'm a survivor, I'm not gon' give up
I'm not gon' stop, I'm gon' work harder
I'm a survivor, I'm gonna make it
I will survive, keep on surviving
I'm a survivor, I'm a survivor
I'm a survivor, I'm gonna make it
I will survive, keep on surviving
[Verse 2]
Thought I couldn't breathe without you, I'm inhaling
Thought I couldn't see without you, perfect vision
Thought I couldn't last without you, but I'm lastin'
Thought that I would die without you, but I'm livin'
Thought that I would fail without you, but I'm on top
Should be over now, but it won't stop
Thought that I would self-destruct, but I'm still here
Even in my years to come, I'm gonna be here[Chorus]
I'm a survivor, I'm not gon' give up
I'm not gon' stop, I'm gon' work harder
I'm a survivor, I'm gonna make it
I will survive, keep on surviving
I'm a survivor, I'm a survivor
I'm a survivor, I'm gonna make it
I will survive, keep on surviving
[Bridge]
Wishin' you the best, pray that you are blessed
Much success, no stress, and lots of happiness
(I'm better than that) not gonna blast you on the radio
(I'm better than that) not gonna lie to your family, no
Not gon' hate on you in the magazines
(I'm better than that) not gonna compromise
(I'm better than that) not gonna diss you on the internet
(I'm better than that) my momma taught me better than that
I'm better than that
I'm a survivor, I'm gonna make it
I will survive, keep on surviving
[Chorus]
I'm a survivor, I'm not gon' give up
I'm not gon' stop, I'm gon' work harder
I'm a survivor, I'm gonna make it
I will survive, keep on surviving
(I'm a survivor)
After all of the darkness and sadness, soon comes happiness
(I'm a survivor)
If I'm surrounded by positive things, I'll gain prosperity
I'm a survivor, I'm a survivor
I'm a survivor, I'm gonna make it
I will survive, I'm a survivor
