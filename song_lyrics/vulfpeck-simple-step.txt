[Verse 1]
Choose a bone in your body
Think about it real good
Move that bone, that bone don't lie
Start the motion, start to open your wings and fly
[Chorus]
Isolation of selected gyration
Can cause wide-world revolution (Ooh)
A simple step, bum, step, bum, bum
Ooh, get on up, baby
[Verse 2]
Close your eyes and imagine
Don't you know that you're good?
A heart and mind interaction
It's the fashion, it's still passion and it feels so good
[Chorus]
Isolation of selected gyration
Can cause wide-world revolution, ooh
A simple step, bum, step, bum, bum
Makes you wanna go, ooh
Yeah
[Bridge]
I know that you got a, a simple step inside ya
I know that you got a, a simple step inside ya
I know that you got a, a simple step inside ya
I know that you got a, a simple step inside you[Chorus]
(Isolation of selected gyration) Yeah
(Can cause wide-world revolution, ooh)
(A simple step, bum, step, bum, bum) Oh, oh, yeah
(Makes you wanna go, ooh) Uh, oh
Isolation of selected gyration
Can cause wide-world revolution, ooh
A simple step (Bum, step, bum, bum)
Uh, a simple step, yeah, a-bum, bum, bum
Bum, bum, bum, oh (Makes you wanna go, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh) Oh, ooh-oh
