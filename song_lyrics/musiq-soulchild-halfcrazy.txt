[Intro]
La la la la la la la, la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la, la la
La la la la la la la
[Verse 1]
Never thought that we would ever be more than friends
Now I'm all confused 'cause for you, I have deeper feelings
We both thought it was cool to cross the line
And I was convinced it would be alright
Now things are strange, nothing's the same
And really I just want my friend back
[Chorus]
And my mind's gone half crazy 'cause I can't leave you alone (Oh can't get you out of my system)
And I'm wonderin' if it's worth me holdin' on (Holdin' on)
Said my mind's gone half crazy 'cause I can't leave you alone (Can't get you out of my system)
And I'm wonderin' if it's worth me holdin' on (Yeah)
[Verse 2]
I'd hate to walk away from you as if this never existed
'Cause when we kissed, the moment after, I looked at you different, yeah
Lately, I gotta watch what I say
'Cause you take things personal nowadays
You used to laugh, now you get mad
Damn, I just want my friend back
