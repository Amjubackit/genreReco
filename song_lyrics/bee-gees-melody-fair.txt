[Verse 1]
Who is the girl with the crying face
Looking at millions of signs?
She knows that life is a running race
Her face shouldn't show any sign
[Chorus]
Melody fair, won't you comb your hair?
You can be beautiful, too
Melody fair, remember you're only a woman
Melody fair, remember you're only a girl
[Verse 2]
Who is the girl at the window pane
Watching the rain falling down?
Melody, life isn't like the rain
It's just like a merry go round
[Chorus]
Melody fair, won't you comb your hair?
You can be beautiful, too
Melody fair, remember you're only a woman
Melody fair, remember you're only a girl
[Verse 3]
Who is the girl with the crying face
Looking at millions of signs?
She knows that life is a running race
Her face shouldn't show any sign[Chorus]
Melody fair, won't you comb your hair?
You can be beautiful, too
Melody fair, remember you're only a woman
Melody fair, remember you're only a girl
