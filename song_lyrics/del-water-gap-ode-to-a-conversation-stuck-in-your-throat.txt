[Verse 1]
I do not want to fight this anymore
I just want to lay back and watch you pin me to the bed
I used to call you my best friend way back before you were my everything
Now I'm sucking your neck
And you wrote my favorite song
Now I'm fucked up and carrying on
I do not know the words to it yet, oh
[Chorus]
And it hits me
I don't want anybody else touching you like I do
Like I do, like me
Is it okay?
That I don't want anybody else touching you like I do
Like I do, like me (Yeah)
[Post-Chorus]
Tell me that nobody else touches you like I do, like I do
Oh, tell me that nobody else touches you like me
Tell me that nobody else touches you like I do, like I do
Oh, tell me that nobody else touches you like me
[Verse 2]
You're pulling on my habit lines
The more I smoke the more I find
I can't just fall asleep instead
And you're not my protector I hope you know it wasn't her
That kept me off your side of the bed, oh[Chorus]
And it hits me
I don't want anybody else touching you like I do
Like I do, like me
Is it okay?
That I don't want anybody else touching you like I do
Like I do, like me
[Bridge]
(You're in his living room)
And it may not mean much to you
But your plates are in his sink
And your sweater's on his bed
Won't you text me when you're home
My baby, spare me all the rest
[Pre-Chorus]
Please just tell me that nobody else touches you like I do
Oh, tell me that nobody else touches you like me
[Chorus]
And it hits me
I don't want anybody else touching you like I do
Like I do, like me
Is it okay?
That I don't want anybody else touching you like I do
Like I do, like me
