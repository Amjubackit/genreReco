[Chorus]
While we lay in diamonds
On a faraway island in a blissful silence
You and I can, you and I can
Fall in love, fall in love
Fall in love
[Verse 1: Dre'es]
All we got is a bag in the backseat
And this love we share, not shabby at all
But the fact is we moving too fast
But the thought passed me
When I got lost inside of your eyes
Clich√© to say but it's too true
Picking up dandys
You always wanted a dandy man, you did
Not a candy man, I don't sugarcoat nothin'
Extra cash come in handy
Good thing we saved up extra
Before we ran away from home
We gotta go
[Chorus]
While we lay in diamonds
On a faraway island in a blissful silence
You and I can, you and I can
Fall in love, fall in love
Fall in love
[Verse 2: Mia]
I know we got our love in the backseat
That's where we met when I told you I can't meet it all
Found out people cause I'm afraid they might say
We have been tryin' take it all
Moving fast but I wanna go faster
Little afraid it'll be a disaster
But I know that I don't wanna crash without you
You're the one that makes me come alive
I never thought it'd come to
Something that was so new
Something that was so true
I can't let it go
[Verse 3: Mia]
You hold no lies
You speak what's on your mind
You speak in different times
You speak in my language, language
The love and the anguish, anguish
Forever and the end, the end
But I don't wanna think about it
Think about it, think about it
Got the money and the time c'mon let's spend it
Don't you pretend we ain't shit without it
World ain't nothin' if we both ain't in it
[Pre-Chorus]
Holdin' hands, so hold my hand
Hold my hand, hold my hand, hold my hand, hold my hand
[Chorus]
When we're laying down
It's on a faraway island in a blissful silence
You and I can, you and I can
Fall in love, fall in love
Fall in love
[Pre-Chorus: Mia & Dre'es]
Holdin' hands, so hold my hand
Hold my hand, hold my hand, hold my hand, hold my hand
[Outro: Dre'es]
Lay in diamonds
Faraway island
Blissful silence
Fall in love
Fall in love
Fall in love
Fall in love
[Background conversation]
[Refrain: Mia]
While we lay in diamonds
On a faraway island in a blissful silence
You and I can, you and I can
Fall in love, fall in love
Fall in love
