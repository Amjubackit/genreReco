[Verse 1: Jenn Johnson]
This moment is holy and I hear You calling
I turn my face towards You and my heart is open
You're always pursuing and my life's surrendered
You have my affection
[Chorus: Jenn Johnson]
So let my life be worship
And let my heart stay true
May my love never grow cold
May it burn forevermore
May my life be worship to You
Oh-oh-oh
Ayy
[Verse 2: Michaela Gentile, Michaela Gentile & Jenn Johnson]
In blessing, in sorrow, in the ordinary
Whatever the cost is, You're always worthy
My heart's cry and my whole life is for Your glory
You have my attention
[Chorus: Michaela Gentile & Jenn Johnson]
So let my life be worship
Let my heart stay true
May my love never grow cold
May it burn forevermore
Let my life be worship to You
[Interlude: Michaela Gentile]
Oh-oh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
[Bridge: Michaela Gentile, Michaela Gentile & Jenn Johnson]
So let it be, let it be worship
You're the only One, only One worth it
Nothing is like You, there's no one beside You
Only You're worthy, You're worthy
So let it be, let it be worship
You're the only One, only One worth it
Nothing is like You, there's no one beside You
Only You're worthy, You're worthy (Ayy-ayy-ayy)
So let it be, let it be worship (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
You're the only One, only One worth it
Nothing is like You, there's no one beside You
Only You're worthy, You're worthy
[Chorus: Michaela Gentile & Jenn Johnson]
So let my life be worship
Let my heart stay true, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
So let my life be worship
Let my heart stay true
May my love never grow cold
May it burn forevermore
Let my life be worship to You
[Outro: Jenn Johnson]
In everything, in everything
