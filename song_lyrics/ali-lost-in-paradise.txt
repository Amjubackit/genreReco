[ALI「LOST IN PARADISE (feat. AKLO)」歌詞]
[Verse 1: AKLO]
Gotta get it, homie, gotta move it, uh
If you gonna do it then 他二の次, ya
Everybody just talk, nobody really do it, nah
なんならやるまでしとけよ秘密に
誰かと確認なんて不要
自分のジャッジだけで break the walls
ド派手なfakeやろうより
Coolにlowにprove them wrong
[Pre-Chorus: LEO]
I won't give it up, the fight in my life
'Cause my life is living for love
I won't give it up, fighting my life
Standing off and groove on time (Woo)
[Chorus: LEO]
Tokyo prison
Going to relight your feelings
When times get too rough, ooh yeah
Night and day are fading
Going to relight your feelings
There's no time to explain
[Post-Chorus: LEO]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Give me your love)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Access to your love)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Oh, yeah)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
[Verse 2: LEO]
Oh, nothing is for real
That's how you make me feel
I gotta beat this stomping on lovе
Ah, pick up my wasted time
God might understand
Nobody can hold me down
[Pre-Chorus: LEO]
I won't give it up, fighting my life
'Cause my life is living for love
I won't give it up, fighting in my life
Standing off and groove on time
[Chorus: LEO]
Tokyo prison
Going to relight your feelings
When times get too rough, ooh yeah
Night and day are blending
Going to relight your feelings
Light up every last one of them (Woo)
[Post-Chorus: LEO]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Give me your love)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Access to your love)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Hey-hey)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
[Interlude: Saxophone and Keys Solo]
[Verse 3: AKLO]
Hey, yeah, またtime is ticking
唯一平等 wasting no more
計画ならdoneするまでnot real
The illest 頂く称号, yeah
誰かの予想軽々超えてはるか向こう
I've done it あれもこれもそれも
もしdownしてもupして on and on, uh
東京 hell から paradise
そりゃ勝ちとるためなら gotta fight
今更やわなかけできるわけねぇだろぶちかませ
頭の中から現実に 変換していく綿密に
眠らずaction 零時過ぎ
このlifeが生み出す芸術品
[Bridge: LEO]
Ah, nothing is for real
That's how you make me feel
I gotta beat this stomping on love
Ah, pick up my wasted time
God might understand
Nobody can hold me down
[Pre-Chorus: LEO]
I won't give it up, fighting my life
'Cause my life is living for love
I won't give it up, fighting in my life
Standing off and groove on time (Woo)
[Chorus: LEO]
Tokyo prison
Going to relight your feelings
When times get too rough, oh yeah
Night and day are fading
Going to relight your feelings
There's no time to explain (Woo)
[Refrain: LEO]
Lost in paradise, night and day are fading out
When time gets rough, access to your love
Lost in paradise, night and day are fading out
Keep on dancing now (Hey, hey)
[Chorus: LEO]
Tokyo prison
Going to relight your feelings
(Ooh yeah, ooh yeah)
Night and day are fading
Going to relight your feelings (Yeah)
Light up every last one of them
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
[Post-Chorus: LEO]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Give me your love)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Access to your love)
Ooh-ooh-ooh, oh yeah
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Oh, give me your love)
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[Refrain: LEO]
Lost in paradise, night and day are fading out
When times get too rough, access to your love
Lost in paradise, night and day are fading out
Keep on dancing now (Hey, eh-eh-eh-eh)
