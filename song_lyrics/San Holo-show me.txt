[Verse]
I am floating out to sea
Time will take it all from me
Don't know where the wind will take me now
But we'll see
But we'll see
I am searching endlessly
Am I where I want to be?
Don't know where this road will take me now
But we'll see
But we'll see
I guess we will see
[Chorus]
I guess we will see
Won't you show me?
Won't you show me?
Won't you show me?
[Verse 2]
Close my eyes so I can see
All these lights are blinding me
Don't know where my mind will take me now
But we'll see
But we'll see
All this longing to be free
What if I could let it be
Don't know when I'll ever find out how
But we'll see
But we'll see
