[Verse 1]
No, sir
Well, I don't wanna be the blame, not anymore
It's your turn
So take a seat, we're settling the final score
And why do we like to hurt so much?
I can't decide
You have made it harder just to go on
And why?
All the possibilities, well, I was wrong
[Chorus]
That's what you get when you let your heart win
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
That's what you get when you let your heart win
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
I drowned out all my sense with the sound of its beating
And that's what you get when you let your heart win
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
[Verse 2]
I wonder
How am I supposed to feel when you're not here?
'Cause I burned
Every bridge I ever built when you were here
I still try
Holding onto silly things, I never learn
Oh, why?
All the possibilities, I'm sure you've heard
