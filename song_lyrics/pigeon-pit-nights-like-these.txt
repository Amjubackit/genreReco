[Verse 1]
Strawberry stained fingertips
Chainsmoking, binge-watching Netflix
Bike grease in my hair
Blood on your jeans
Blisters on our feet
A huge grin full of teeth
The California drought
The smell after the thunderstorm
That knocked the power out
Sweat soaks up my handle bars
I want to die with all my scars
If they don't like the way we are, then fuck 'em
[Chorus]
And I stayed up, chainsmoking in the kitchen
'Til you got home and the curtains were on fire
Fuck, I'm sorry you feel all alone
With the TV blasting shadows on my face
Hitching back to the apartment
It was such a lonely place
I place my head between my knees and think
"Do you ever have nights like these?"
So separated from my sense of self
And the shit you keep up on your bookshelf[Verse 2]
So, I just take another sip
I keep falling off and eating shit and forgetting to unclip
The sun will rise some other time, for now it's me and you, our bikes
We trip and stumble, laughing, to the park
The flea bites laid out on my wrist
The heart shaped blister on my palm
The handlebars had etched, my body's out
On my back porch my brain is fucking somewhere else
On the roof with the flags we torched
[Chorus]
And I stayed up, 
chainsmoking
 in the kitchen
'Til you got home and the curtains were on fire
Fuck, I'm sorry you feel all alone
With the TV blasting shadows on my face
Hitching back to the apartment
It was such a lonely place
I place my head between my knees and think
"Do you ever have nights like these?"
So separated from my sense of self
And the shit you keep up on your bookshelf
