[Verse 1]
Every highway, every stranger that I met
Well, I went my way, but I never really left
And when I’m lonely and I’m needing something new
When I’m lost in the mazes and turning the phrases
And looking for something true
[Chorus]
I’ll be lovin’ you, no matter where I roam
I’ll be lovin’ you, you’re at the end of every road
When the stars are out at night, when the sky is crystal blue
I’ll do the only thing I know to do, I’ll be lovin’ you
[Refrain]
I’ll be lovin’ you
[Verse 2]
Tried to find it in thе roses, in the snow
Tried to climb it, hit a Rocky Mountain low
I couldn’t hidе it, like the bottle in my boot
When I’m deep in the dark and I look in my heart
And I’m looking for something true
[Chorus]
I’ll be lovin’ you, no matter where I roam
I’ll be lovin’ you, you’re at the end of every road
When the stars are out at night, when the sky is crystal blue
I’ll do the only thing I know to do, I’ll be lovin’ you
