[Intro: Vocals by Mr Tanqueray]
Mmm, holy goodness, gracious of life, girl
I ain't seen you in such a long time
You lookin' gooder than a mug
You got a man friend?
Or you got a boyfriend?
Aiight, well when you ready to drop that zero
And get with this hero
Slide over to this bar wit' me real quick
Hell yea, let's get these drinks baby
You gon' save me $32
