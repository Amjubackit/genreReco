[Chorus: NF & 
Cordae
]
Stuntin' on me, you get exposed (Woo)
I don't wanna pick, then I buy both (Buy both)
Doesn't go plat', it'll go gold (Go gold)
Keep it upfront, I don't tiptoe (Ayy)
I be at the house tryna lay low (Lay low)
Duckin' and dodgin' the promo (Promo)
Sit on my roof like J. Cole (Ayy)
Yeah, sit on my roof like J. Cole (Ayy, J. Cole, ayy)
Thinkin' 'bout how I'm so thankful (Woo)
Subpar songs, I don't make those, huh (I don't make those)
Look at that car I paid for, huh (I paid for)
Look at my life, I'm grateful, huh (I'm grateful)
Hatin' on me, that's hateful, huh (That's hateful)
You know I hit what I aim for, huh (Aim for)
Talkin' 'bout risks, I take those, huh (I take 'em)
Didn't get here bein' careful, oh (
Listen, uh
)
[Verse 1: Cordae]
Talkin' 'bout risk, I take tho' (Woo)
Millionaire, still ride with the Draco (Ah)
Courtside at the game, jumbotron got my name on it
That's how a typical day goes (For real)
I just left Nigeria, Lagos (Lagos)
I just met Kanye, Yezos (Ye)
I was talkin' to God 'bout what's real or what's not
All He said was, "Remain faithful" (Ayy)
Okay, I get it, I got it, I'm with it, I'm 'bout it
My crib is exotic, I'm blessed, hey (I'm blessed)
We livin' chaotic, was high off narcotics
But that's when my life was a mess, hey (A mess)
We come from the bottom, we still at the bottom
I get high to relieve the stress, hey (The stress)
I don't think y'all get the message
This world is built off misconceptions (Uh)
Talkin' 'bout greed, talkin' 'bout envy
Talkin' 'bout money, then we talkin' 'bout plenty ('Bout plenty)
Talkin' 'bout dollars or we talkin' 'bout pennies?
Talkin' 'bout drinkin', then we talkin' 'bout Henny
What we talkin' 'bout?
Lost souls at a crossroads
Money comin' in in large loads
I've been crossed, so my heart cold
That's all we know, yeah
