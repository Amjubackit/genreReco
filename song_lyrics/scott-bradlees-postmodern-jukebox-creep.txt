When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so very special
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
I don't care if it hurts
I want to have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
And I want you to notice
When I'm not around
You're so very special
Yeah, I wish I was special
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here, oh, oh
She's running, well she's running out again
I said she's running out
She's run run run run, ohh
When I said, I said she's run
I said she's....
Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so very special
Yeah, I wish I was special
But I'm a creep, ooh I said it, I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong
I'm a creep, I'm, I'm a weirdo, ohh
What the hell am I doing here? oh yeah....
I don't belong here ooh
I don't belong here
