[Chorus]
Baby, let's stay home tonight
We can put a couple records on
We can build a fire, alright
Maybe we can dance 'til dawn
Everything will be just fine
Don't even have to put clothes on
I can keep you warm inside
Baby, let's stay home tonight
[Verse 1]
Lately, we've been walking in a straight line
Doing our own thing, never seem to find time
We've been going downtown, making reservations
But maybe we just slow down, see where it can take us
[Chorus]
Baby, let's stay home tonight
We can put a couple records on
We can build a fire, alright
Maybe we can dance 'til dawn
Everything will be just fine
Don't even have to put clothes on
I can keep you warm inside
Baby, let's stay home tonight[Verse 2]
I know you wanna get dressed up
But I know who you are, girl
Ain't no need for makeup
Cause you're my angel and I don't wanna share you
So why don't we just slow down, see where it can take us
[Chorus]
Baby, let's stay home tonight
We can put a couple records on
We can build a fire, alright
Maybe we can dance 'til dawn
Everything will be just fine
Don't even have to put clothes on
I can keep you warm inside
Baby, let's stay home tonight
[Chorus]
Baby, let's stay home tonight
We can put a couple records on
We can build a fire, alright
Maybe we can dance 'til dawn
Everything will be just fine
Don't even have to put clothes on
I can keep you warm inside
Baby, let's stay home tonight
Yeah, baby, let's stay home tonight
