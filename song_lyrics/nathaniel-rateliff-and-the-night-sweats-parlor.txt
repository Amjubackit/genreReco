Last night in the parlor
And I ain't other boys in the band
While I stood there in the corner
And I wait for the feeling to dance
Every woman and their baby
Better call them all if you can
And today found her swinging
Rather be there clapping your hands
I said hey man, holler
Twist in the parlor
Move those feet if you can
Don't just stand there in the corner
And wait for the feeling to dance
I said ah oh, ah oh
Ah oh, ah oh
Last night in the parlor
I was only taking the best
But I held myself together
All the rain was taking me down
I said hey man, holler
Twist in the parlor
Move your feet if you can
Don't just stand there in the corner
And wait for the feeling to danceIt was last night in the parlor
Well, we gave all the hell that we had
Gone today, don't you want it
I'll twist and shake it again
I said hey man, holler
Twist in the parlor
Move your feet if you can
Don't just stand there in the corner
And wait for the feeling to dance
I said ah oh, ah oh
Ah oh, ah oh
Ah oh, ah oh
