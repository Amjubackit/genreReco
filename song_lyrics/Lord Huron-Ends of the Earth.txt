[Intro]
Ooh, ooh-ooh ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh ooh
[Verse 1]
Oh, there's a river that winds on forever
I'm gonna see where it leads
Oh, there's a mountain that no man has mounted
I'm gonna stand on the peak
Out there's a land that time don't command
Wanna be the first to arrive
No time for ponderin', why, I'm a-wanderin'
Not while we're both still alive
[Chorus]
To the ends of the earth,
 would you follow me?
There's a world that was meant for our eyes to see
To the ends of the earth, would you follow me?
If you won't, I must say my goodbyes to thee
[Refrain]
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
