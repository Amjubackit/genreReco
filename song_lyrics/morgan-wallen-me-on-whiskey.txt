[Verse 1]
I know we made a downtown reservation
Let's get there early, get drunk, and break it
There's cabs outside we could wave and take one
To that little dive bar you like
I know you got your red dress on, but
It was always gonna come back off
So go on and call me crazy
We both know it's just a matter of time, baby
[Chorus]
With me on whiskey, and you on wine
Gettin' Tennessee tipsy in the neon light
Yeah, it's what we do, girl, it's kind of our thing
A little jukebox dance and then a smoky dream
We're as easy as you got your drink I got mine
But we got the same thing on our mind
I guarantee best times tend to be
With you on wine, and me on whiskey
With you on wine, and me on whiskey, yeah
[Verse 2]
Let's get started on an all-night nightcap
That won't wind down until the break of dawn
And we can keep it rollin' like that
'Cause right about now, it don't sound wrong
Girl, I know you got all dressed up
Yeah, and now we're gettin' all messed up
We don't just do it 'cause we're good at it
Yeah, we do it 'cause we find some good things happen[Chorus]
With me on whiskey, and you on wine
Gettin' Tennessee tipsy in the neon light
Yeah, it's what we do, girl, it's kind of our thing
A little jukebox dance and then a smoky dream
We're as easy as you got your drink I got mine
But we got the same thing on our mind
I guarantee best times tend to be
With you on wine, and me on whiskey
With you on wine, and me on whiskey, yeah
[Bridge]
Girl, I know you got your red dress on
Sittin' pretty on that old barstool and
And we don't ever get enough of this
It's pretty simple, baby, all it is
[Chorus]
It's me on whiskey, and you on wine
Gettin' Tennessee tipsy in the neon light
Yeah, it's what we do, girl, it's kind of our thing
A little jukebox dance and then a smoky dream
We're as easy as you got your drink I got mine
But we got the same thing on our mind
I guarantee best times tend to be
With you on wine, and me on whiskey
Yeah, yeah
With you on wine, and me on whiskey, oh, oh
