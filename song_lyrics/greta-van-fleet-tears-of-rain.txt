[Verse 1]
Bathing in the light around us
Praying for the night to comfort thee
Dancing on the coals below us
Praying for the flood to set us free
[Chorus]
And the planet is still turning
And the faces are still burning
And the mothers with their children search for the rain
[Verse 2]
Drifting through the plains before us
As it turns to dust before our eyes
Pleading for a god to pour us
Just a little bit of rain from an empty sky
[Chorus]
And the planet is still turning
And the faces are still burning
And the mothers with their children search for the rain
[Instrumental]
Yeah[Outro]
Who will bring the rain? Woah
Who will bring the rain? Hey
Who will bring the rain? No, no, no
Who will bring the rain? Woah
Who will bring it?
Who will bring the rain?
