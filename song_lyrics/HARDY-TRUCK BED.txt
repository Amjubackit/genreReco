[Chorus]
I woke up on the wrong side of the truck bed this morning
With a bone-dry bottle of Jack I was pouring
Damn, she got some nerve way she kicked me to the curb
Guess you can say I got what I deserve
'Cause I woke up on the wrong side of the truck bed this morning
(Yeah)
[Verse 1]
She said, "Don't come home if you go to the bar"
I said, "Okay, baby" then got drunk out in the yard
2 AM I knock knock knocked up on the door
But she never unlock-locked it, guess I don't live there no more
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Yeah, she meant business this time
I can't believe my bloodshot eyes
[Chorus]
I woke up on the wrong side of the truck bed this morning
With a bone-dry bottle of Jack I was pouring
Damn, she got some nerve way she kicked me to the curb
Guess you can say I got what I deserve
'Cause I woke up on the wrong side of the truck bed this morning
(Yeah)
