[Verse 1]
Been travelling these wide roads
For so long
My heart's been far from you
Ten thousand miles gone
[Refrain]
Oh, I wanna come near and give
Every part of me
But there's blood on my hands
And my lips are unclean
[Verse 2]
In my darkness I remember
Momma's words reoccur to me
"Surrender to the good Lord
And he'll wipe your slate clean"
[Chorus]
Take me to
 
your river
I wanna go
Oh, go, take me to
 
your river
I wanna know
[Verse 3]
Dip me in your smooth water
As I go in
As a man with many crimes, come up for air
As my sins flow down the Jordan
