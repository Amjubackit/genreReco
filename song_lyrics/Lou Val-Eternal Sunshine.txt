[Intro]
Oh (Oh)
[Verse 1]
I found my way to you
When I was sleeping, dreaming
Tell me if it's too soon
To feel the way I'm feeling
[Chorus]
'Cause God knows (God knows)
If I were to lose you, time goes (Time goes)
Further away, just dispose (Dispose)
Whatever's left of my soul (My soul)
'Cause I won't need it anymore
'Cause I won't need it anymore
Ayy-ayy, ayy-ayy
Ayy-ayy
[Verse 2]
Hope you feel the way I do (I do), yeah
Everything's good when it's mutual
You don't have to say "I do" (I do)
I just need to know if you listen
[Chorus]
'Cause God knows (God knows)
If I were to lose you, time goes (Time goes)
Further away, just dispose (Dispose)
Whatevеr's left of my soul (My soul)
'Cause I won't need it anymore
'Causе I won't need it anymore
Ayy-ayy, ayy-ayy
Ayy-ayy, ayy-ayy
Ayy-ayy, ayy-ayy
