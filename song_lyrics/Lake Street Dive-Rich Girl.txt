[Chorus]
You're a rich girl, and you've gone too far
'Cause you know it don't matter anyway
You can rely on the old man's money
You can rely on the old man, honey
It's a bitch, girl, but you're gone too far
'Cause you know it don't matter anyway
Say money, but it won't get you too far
Get you too far
[Verse 1]
And don't you know
Don't you know, yeah
That it's wrong to take what is given you?
So far gone, on your own, yeah
You can get along if you try to be strong
But you'll never be strong
[Chorus]
Oh, you're a rich girl, and you've gone too far
'Cause you know it don't matter anyway
You can rely on the old man's money
You can rely on the old man, honey
It's a bitch, girl, and you've gone too far
'Cause you know it don't matter anyway
Oh, say money, but it won't get you too far
Get you too far
