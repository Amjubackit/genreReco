To the One who wore
A crown of thorns
To the One who took
The lash and scourge
For the hands and feet
That were pierced by nails
For the sacrifice
That has torn the veil
We crown You!
We fall face down and we worship!
We all cry out “You are worthy God!”
“You are worthy, God!”
(You are worthy, so worthy)
To the One who gave
His very life away
Who took upon Himself
All our guilt and shame
Hanging on a cross
For the world He loved
With His precious blood
Purchased men for God
We crown You!
We fall face down and we worship!
We all cry out “You arе worthy God!”
“You are worthy, God!”
