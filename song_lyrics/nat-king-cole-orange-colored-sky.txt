[Verse 1]
I was walking along, minding my business
When out of an orange colored sky
(Flash! Bam! Alakazam!)
Wonderful you came by
[Verse 2]
I was hummin' a tune, drinking in sunshine
When out of that orange colored view
(Flash! Bam! Alakazam!)
I got a look at you
[Bridge]
One look and I yell "timber"
Watch out for flying glass
'Cause the ceiling fell in, the bottom fell out
I went into a spin and I started to shout
"I've been hit, this is it, this is it, I-T, it!"
[Verse 3]
I was walking along, minding my business
When love came and hit me in the eye
(Flash! Bam! Alakazam!)
Out of an orange colored sky
[Instrumental Break]
[Bridge]
One look and I yell "timber"
Watch out for flying glass
'Cause the ceiling fell in, the bottom fell out
I went into a spin and I started to shout
"I've been hit, this is it, this is it, I-T, it!"
[Outro]
I was walkin' along
Mindin' my business
When love came and hit me in the eye
(Flash! Bam! Alakazam!)
Out of an orange colored
Purple striped, pretty green polka-dot sky
(Flash! Bam!)
Alakazam and goodbye
Wow, I thought love was much softer than that
What a most disturbing sound
