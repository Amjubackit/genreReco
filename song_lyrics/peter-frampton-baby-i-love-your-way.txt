[Verse 1]
Shadows grow so long before my eyes
And they're moving across the page
Suddenly, the day turns into night
Far away from the city
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't hesitate
'Cause your love won't wait
[Chorus]
Ooh, baby, I love your way
Wanna tell you I love your way
Wanna be with you night and day, ay
[Verse 2]
Moon appears to shine and light the sky
With the help of some fireflies
I wonder how they have the power to shine, shine, shine
I can see them under the pine
[Pre-Chorus]
But don't hesitate
'Cause your love won't wait, yeah
[Chorus]
Ooh, baby, I love your way
Wanna tell you I love your way
Wanna be with you night and day[Bridge]
Well, don't, don't hesitate
'Cause your love won't wait
[Verse 3]
I can see the sunset in your eyes
Brown and gray, blue besides
Clouds are stalking islands in the sun
I wish I could buy one
Out of season
[Pre-Chorus]
But don't hesitate
'Cause your love won't wait, oh
[Chorus]
Ooh, baby, I love your way
Wanna tell you I love your way
Wanna be with you night and day
Ooh, baby, I love your way
