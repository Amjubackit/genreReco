[Verse 1: HARDY and 
Morgan Wallen
]
Red
I'm talking ’bout the sun coming up and the sun going down
On a John Deere, turning up a hard-work check
Making that blue-collar country boy's neck
Red
I'm talking ’bout the color of them jerseys on a Friday night
At the end of another long, hot, dry summer
'Tween the dust and the rust, the trucks are half covered in red
[Pre-Chorus 1: HARDY]
Like a bloodhound
Tracking some whitetail buck down
[Chorus: Both]
I ain't talking politics
, I'm talking small town
And if you're from one, you know what I'm talking 'bout
It's everywhere, I swear, from the courthouse bricks
To a crushed Bud heavy can fading in the ditch
Like the book of John, like a barn door
And hearts your hand’s over ’cause you're thankful for
Every shipped-off soul that was born to fight
For a wind-torn flag that’s blue and white and red
[Verse 2: Morgan Wallen and 
Both
]
Red
I'm talkin' 'bout a county line stop sign full of birdshot
The cup your beer’s in sitting 'round a fire
Like your bank account when you bought them tires
That led[Pre-Chorus 2: Both]
You down a dirt road
And got some red lips leaning cross the console
[Chorus: Both]
I ain't talking politics, I'm talking small town
And if you're from one, you know what I'm talking 'bout
It's everywhere, I swear, from the courthouse bricks
To a crushed Bud heavy can fading in the ditch
Like the book of John, like a barn door
And hearts your hand's over 'cause you're thankful for
Every shipped-off soul that was born to fight
For a wind-torn flag that's blue and white and red
[Bridge: Both, 
Morgan Wallen
, 
HARDY

It don't matter who you are
Got your back if that's what you need
'Cause at the end of the day
Hey, we all bleed
Red
[Chorus: Both]
I ain't talking politics, I'm talking small town
And if you're from one, you know what I'm talking 'bout
It's everywhere, I swear, from the courthouse bricks
To a crushed Bud heavy can fading in the ditch
Like the book of John, like a barn door
And hearts your hand's over 'cause you're thankful for
Every shipped-off soul that was born to fight
For a wind-torn flag that's blue and white and red[Outro: Both, 
Morgan Wallen
]
Yeah, a wind-torn flag that's blue and white and red
Yeah, a wind-torn flag that's blue and white and red
