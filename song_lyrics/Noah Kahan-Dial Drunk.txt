[Verse 1]
I'm rememberin' I promised to forget you now
But it's rainin' and I'm callin' drunk
And my medicine is drowning 
your perspective out
So I ain't taking any fault
Am I honest still? Am I half the man I used to be?
I doubt it, forget about it, whatever
It's all the same anyways
[Chorus]
I ain't proud of all the punches that I've thrown
In the name of someone I no longer know
For the shame of being young, drunk, and alone
Traffic lights and a transmitter radio
I don't like that, when they threw me in the car
I gave your name as my emergency phone call
Honey, it rang and rang, even the cops thought you were wrong for hanging up
I dial drunk, I'll die a drunk, I'll die for you
[Verse 2]
I'm untethering from the parts of me you'd recognize
From charming to alarming in seconds
I'll be bedridden, I'll let the pain metastasize
But, that's morning, I'll forget it
And the dial tone is all I have
