[Intro]
Yeah I wrote this song
And I pray that you listen to all the words
'Cause I feel like at some point in everybody's life
We feel like this
[Verse 1]
Lord, I'm split in two
Part of me loves the world
And the other loves You
So, what do I do
I wanna be saved
But I got to stay cool, too
And no, I'm not a fool
I know eventually I'm gonna have to choose
And, really I don't wanna lose
My ticket into Heaven
And a chance to be used by You
[Pre-Chorus]
And if it's God that I'm after
I just can't serve two masters
And before something happens
I gotta turn it all around
Because I know
[Chorus]
I can't just have my cake and eat it too
'Cause it's real easy to stay on the fence and still do you
And it'd be cool if we could love the Lord and still go do our thing
But see, it doesn't work like that
You gotta be white or black
[Verse 2]
See, I've realized
When it comes to sin
You just don't compromise
See, it's a matter of death and life
Be weak and do wrong
Or be strong and do right
And I don't wanna keep going to church
Singing all about how much You're worth
And then continue doing my dirt
Living as if I didn't care if You're hurt
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause if it's God that I'm after
I just can't serve two masters
And before something happens
I gotta turn it all around
Because I know
[Chorus]
I can't just have my cake and eat it too
'Cause it's real easy to stay on the fence and still do you
And it'd be cool if we could love the Lord and still go do our thing
But see, it doesn't work like that
You gotta be white or black
[Bridge]
Lord, I really need you to help me
(Get it together)
Saints, we really gotta
(Get it together)
[Pre-Chorus]
And if it's God that I'm after
I just can't serve two masters
And before something happens
I gotta turn it all around
Because I know
[Chorus]
I can't just have my cake and eat it too
'Cause it's real easy to stay on the fence and still do you
And it'd be cool if we could love the Lord and still go do our thing
But see, it doesn't work like that
You gotta be white or black
No, it don't work like that
You gotta be white or black
[Outro]
No Gray
No shades of gray
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
It don't work like that
No gray
