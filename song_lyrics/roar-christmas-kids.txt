[Verse 1]
Ronnette, my dear, don't ever disappear
Do what you want as long as you stay here
I need you now, I love you so much
More than you could know
[Verse 2]
The Christmas kids were nothing but a gift
And love is a tower where all of us can live
[Pre-Chorus]
You'll change your name or change your mind
And leave this fucked up place behind
[Chorus]
But I'll know, I'll know
I'll know, I'll know
I'll know, I'll know
I'll know, I'll know
[Bridge]
Appearing unsightly
With devils inside me
If you ever try to leave me, I'll find you, Ronnie
If you ever try to leave me, I'll find you, Ronnie
If you ever try to leave me, I'll find you, Ronnie
If you ever try to leave me, I'll find you, Ronnie
[Verse 3]
I'm leaving, Phil, I'm leaving now
I'm going to escape, but you won't know how
Or where to find me when I'm gone
I'll drink myself to death inside
This prison cell
This prison cell
[Pre-Chorus]
So get me out of here
Get me out of here
Get me out of here
Get me out of here
You'll change your name or change your mind
And leave this fucked up place behind
[Chorus]
But I'll know, I'll know
I'll know, I'll know
I'll know, I'll know
I'll know, I'll know
