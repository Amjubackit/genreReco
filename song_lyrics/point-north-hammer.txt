[Verse 1]
Yeah
I did it all on my own, no promo
I got fans gettin' tats of my logo
I remember when nobody came to my shows
But I kept comin' back like a yo-yo
In high school, they would laugh, try to label
Eatin' lunch with nobody at my table
Everyone that used to doubt got a day job
I just made a few stacks off a merch drop
[Pre-Chorus]
It's about time that they go and take me serious
If you not feelin' this, you probably delirious
I'm on one, yes, I'm on one, they could never be
Me, 'cause I'm the reaper in your dreams, 'cause
It's about time they trade the clout for sobriety
I can feel the hate buildin' up, it's inside of me
I'm on one, yes, I'm on one, they could never be
Me, 'cause I'm the reaper in your dreams, 'cause
[Chorus]
Play the guitar like a young Santana
Reppin' VT like my name Bernie Sanders
Livin' two lives like my name Danny Phantom
All my shit bang like a motherfuckin' hammer
Play the guitar like a young Santana
Reppin' VT like my name Bernie Sanders
Livin' two lives like my name Danny Phantom
All my shit bang like a motherfuckin' hammer[Verse 2]
CDG on my feet when I hop out
Me and B on the beat, that's a bop now
Whole squad goin' dumb like it's summer school
I got hits, got smashes like a drummer do
OMG, now you see me on the TV
Went from sellin' beats, to now I'm sellin' CD's
Know you see me, know you need me, but believe me
I feel like dyin' like my name Lil' Weezy
[Pre-Chorus]
It's about time that they go and take me serious
If you not feelin' this, you probably delirious
I'm on one, yes, I'm on one, they could never be
Me, 'cause I'm the reaper in your dreams, 'cause
It's about time they trade the clout for sobriety
I can feel the hate buildin' up, it's inside of me
I'm on one, yes, I'm on one, they could never be
Me, 'cause I'm the reaper in your dreams, 'cause
[Chorus]
Play the guitar like a young Santana
Reppin' VT like my name Bernie Sanders
Livin' two lives like my name Danny Phantom
All my shit bang like a motherfuckin' hammer
Play the guitar like a young Santana
Reppin' VT like my name Bernie Sanders
Livin' two lives like my name Danny Phantom
All my shit bang like a motherfuckin' hammer[Bridge]
So I'll drive all night through my home town
You can drive your knife through my chest now
I'ma crash my car by your old house
'Cause all I'll ever be is a letdown
So I'll drive all night through my home town
You can drive your knife through my chest now
I'ma crash my car by your old house
'Cause all I'll ever be is a letdown
[Breakdown]
Fuck me, but fuck you more
I wish I was never born
Hammer, hammer
Hammer, hammer
[Chorus]
Play the guitar like a young Santana
Reppin' VT like my name Bernie Sanders
Livin' two lives like my name Danny Phantom
All my shit bang like a motherfuckin' hammer
Play the guitar like a young Santana
Reppin' VT like my name Bernie Sanders
Livin' two lives like my name Danny Phantom
All my shit bang like a motherfuckin' hammer
