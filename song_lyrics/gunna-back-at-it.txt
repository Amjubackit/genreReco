[Chorus]
Back at it
Smokin' this 'Scotti, this shit startin' to hit like it's crack in it
The boy got the rock and he sleep at the top like a crack addict
Two racks just for the tank top, you niggas is pathetic
Back at it (Yeah)
Back at it (Yeah)
Mess the boy up and I gave them the drip, let them gon' on (Yeah)
And this is the thanks that I get, nigga, you tell me who on
Gotta go now, I can't prolong (Prolong), I'm out of space in a ozone (Ozone)
In a spaceship let it float on (Float on), can't stop me now, nigga, hold on
[Verse 1]
Double R truck and it's black, yuh
Load 'em up, get 'em intact, yuh
I'm flyin' like the black like a bat, yuh
These fuck niggas poppin' my back, damn
Add up the numbers the math, yuh
I heard all of your stories is cap, yuh
Gervonta that boy out with a right jab
I bet he didn't know he was right there
I heard a few shots, that's a hot pair (Hot)
It's gon' be a whole 'nother sound
I promise that I can come drip the town
'Cause I ain't got no hate towards your town (Nah)
Nigga wan' see me walk with my head down
Think it's funny, I ain't playin' around (Nah)
I'm in my bed but a nigga ain't layin' down
If I pull up, I'm tearin' it down
[Chorus]
Back at it
Smokin' this 'Scotti, this shit startin' to hit like it's crack in it
The boy got the rock and he sleep at the top like a crack addict
Two racks just for the tank top, you niggas is pathetic
Back at it (Yeah)
Back at it (Yeah)
Mess the boy up and I gave them the drip, let them gon' on (Yeah)
And this is the thanks that I get, nigga, you tell me who on
Gotta go now, I can't prolong (Prolong), I'm out of space in a ozone (Ozone)
In a spaceship let it float on (Float on), can't stop me now, nigga, hold on
[Verse 2]
Big Double R, it's the Rolls truck
Blow the dust off, get it back crunk (Yeah)
Go on a move, better mask up
Niggas caught up but be dead drunk
Ain't tryna sleep inâ€”
Ain't tryna sleep in no damn bunk
I'm 'posed to be here making anthems
And some of you niggas know well enough
Gunna stay with it and it's been a minute, I know I been too hard to find
I had to admit it I know that you niggas could never be one of my kind
Asian persuasion
Asian persuasion, she's fine
Hit that shit right from behind
I can go two at a time
[Chorus]
Back at it
Smokin' this 'Scotti, this shit startin' to hit like it's crack in it
The boy got the rock and he sleep at the top like a crack addict
Two racks just for the tank top, you niggas is pathetic
Back at it (Yeah)
Back at it (Yeah)
Mess the boy up and I gave them the drip, let them gon' on (Yeah)
And this is the thanks that I get, nigga, you tell me who on
Gotta go now, I can't prolong (Prolong), I'm out of space in a ozone (Ozone)
In a spaceship let it float on (Float on), can't stop me now, nigga, hold on
