[Verse 1]
Are you sitting at home, all alone, trying to fall asleep?
Are you staring a hole through your phone, praying that it rings?
Are you watching a movie that you've seen a thousand times?
Or maybe playing some Mayer
, getting lost in your favorite lines
[Pre-Chorus]
Well, if you're anything like me
You just might be doing whatever it takes
To drown out the noise
But I just wanna hear your voice
[Chorus]
Iâ€™m one number away
From calling to you
I said I was through
But I'm dying, inside
Got my head in a mess
Girl, I confess
I lied when I said
"I'm leaving and not coming back"
Might be the whiskey or the midnight rain
But everywhere I go, I see your face
In my brain, dial it up, everything I wanna say
But I'm still one number away
