Its Rizo
No more broken hearts
No more
No more broken
No more broken
No more broken hearts
Yea
Shawty giving Esther but she fed up
Searching for a King to hold it down
All this time you been waiting your turn
They can never take what's yours
Its already written baby girl don't trip
He already know what it is
Don't rush just be still
God'll give it to you when it fits
Surrender your will and just ride
Love yourself in the meantime
Never feed into the lies
He know your heart dеsires
Shawty giving Esther but she fеd up
Yea yea
Shawty giving Esther

God'll give it to you when it fits
Shawty giving Esther
Don't you let them down days fester
Don't you let your friends peer pressure
When its their time tell them bless up
Cause when its yours
Flood gates from Heaven
I know telling you its coming
Is like preaching to the reverend
But somebody had to tell you
Sit back and let it settle
God pulling strings like Geppetto
Don't put your faith in no fellow
They poking at you with they nose when they tell you
It ain't in your cards but God aligning the stars
You deserve a lot like a line of cars
Everything you want already yours
If you believe it
That's the hardest part of receiving
Its your season
Only if you lean inShawty giving Esther but she fed up
Searching for a King to hold it down
All this time you been waiting your turn
They can never take what's yours
Its already written baby girl don't trip
He already know what it is
Don't rush just be still
God'll give it to you when it fits
