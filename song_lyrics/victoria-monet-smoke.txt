[Intro: Victoria Monét & Lucky Daye]
Oh, oh-oh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh
Oh, oh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
[Chorus: Victoria Monét & 
Lucky Daye
]
Little fireworks that light up for me
In my fingertips I burn my worries
Do it somethin' like that A-track shorty
Keep it in rotation, it's a celebration every time we smoke, smoke
Do it somethin' like that A-track shorty (
Woo-ooh-ooh
)
Keep it in rotation (
Woo-ooh-ooh
), it's a celebration every time we—
[Verse 1: Victoria Monét, 
Victoria Monét & Lucky Daye
]
You don't even gotta ask, you know I 
got some
Pre-rolls in the bag, who should I 
shotgun?
 (Yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
To the left or the right, 'long as it 
rotate
It's a bisexual blunt, it can go 
both ways
, yeah
[Pre-Chorus: Lucky Daye]
Hotbox while you hit the box, top, get you to the top
Rock but if it's a lot, I can take it from you
Got nothin' but that gas, pass it, then pass it back
Cough, you don't need a mask
This that shit you smoke to (Oh-oh, oh-oh)[Chorus: Victoria Monét & 
Lucky Daye
]
Little fireworks that light up for me
In my fingertips I burn my worries
Do it somethin' like that A-track shorty
Keep it in rotation, it's a celebration every time we smoke, smoke
Do it somethin' like that A-track shorty (
Woo-ooh-ooh
)
Keep it in rotation (
Woo-ooh-ooh
), it's a celebration every time we—
[Verse 2: Lucky Daye]
Trees, got the smoke, now we just need a lighter (Ooh)
That body, ah, you got that Earth, Wind and Fire
If you know how to roll then come be my supplier
Up in the clouds, we get high like Mariah
[Pre-Chorus: Lucky Daye & 
Victoria Monét
]
Hotbox while you hit the box, top, get you to the top
Rock but if it's a lot, I can take it from you (
I can take it from you
)
Got nothin' but that gas, pass it, then pass it back
Cough, you don't need a mask
This that shit you smoke to (Oh-oh)
[Chorus: Victoria Monét & 
Lucky Daye
]
Little fireworks that light up for me
In my fingertips I burn my worries
Do it somethin' like that A-track shorty
Keep it in rotation, it's a celebration every time we smoke, smoke
Do it somethin' like that A-track shorty (
Woo-ooh-ooh
)
Keep it in rotation (
Woo-ooh-ooh
), it's a celebration every time we—[Outro: Victoria Monét & Lucky Daye]

Roll up and let it play
This that shit you smoke to
