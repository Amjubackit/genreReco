[Verse]
Well, you can tell by the way I use my walk
I'm a woman's man, no time to talk
Music loud and women warm
I've been kicked around since I was born
[Pre-Chorus]
And now it's all right, it's okay
And you may look the other way
We can try to understand
The New York Times' effect on man
[Chorus]
Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother
You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Feel the city breaking and everybody shaking
And we're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive
Oh, when you walk
[Outro]
Life's goin' nowhеre, somebody help mе
Somebody help me, yeah
Life goin' nowhere, somebody help me, yeah
I'm stayin' alive
Life's goin' nowhere
