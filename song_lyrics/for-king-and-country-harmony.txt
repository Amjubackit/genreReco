[Verse 1]
Silently and separately the same
But they're apart
A world apart
Turn it round and round inside their head
But where to start?
Where to start?
[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody had their reasons to look away
But won’t you find a reason to stay?
[Chorus: Luke & Joel Smallbone]
I'll keep singing, keep singing
This old melody
And I'll always be waiting
For your harmony
[Verse 2]
There’s nothing left to say, it's all been said
But even so
We won't let it go
And all of us hold onto empty hands
Yet even so
We don't let go[Pre-Chorus]
And everybody had their reasons to walk away
But won't you find the reason to say
[Chorus]
I'll keep singing, keep singing
This old melody
I'll always be waiting
For your harmony
[Interlude]
Ooh, oh
Ooh, oh
Ooh, oh
Hmm, hmm
[Chorus]
I'll keep singing, keep singing
This old melody
And I’ll always bе waiting
For your harmony
Keep singing, keep singing (Ooh)
This old melody
And I’ll always be waiting (Ooh)
For your harmony[Outro]
Find a reason to livе, a reason to sing
This harmony (Ooh, hmm)
