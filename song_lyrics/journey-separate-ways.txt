[Verse 1]
Here we stand
Worlds apart
Hearts broken in two, two, two
Sleepless nights
Losing ground
I am reaching for you, you, you
Feeling that it's gone
Cannot change your mind
If we cannot go on
To survive the tide
Love divides
[Chorus]
Someday love will find you
Break those chains that bind you
One night will remind you
How we touched
And went our separate ways
If he ever hurts you
True love will not desert you
You know I still love you
Though we touched
And went our separate ways[Verse 2]
Troubled times
Caught between confusions and pain, pain, pain
Distant eyes
Promises we made were in vain
In vain, vain
If you must go
I wish you love
You will never walk alone
Take care my love
Miss you love
[Chorus]
Someday love will find you
Break those chains that bind you
One night will remind you
How we touched
And went our separate ways
If he ever hurts you
True love won't desert you
You know I still love you
Though we touched
And went our separate ways
[Instrumental Interlude]Oooooooooh
Someday love will find you
Break those chains that bind you
One night will remind you
If he ever hurts you
True love won't desert you
You know I still love you
I still love you, girl
I really love you, girl
And if he ever hurts you
True love won't desert you
Nooooooooo
Nooooooooo
