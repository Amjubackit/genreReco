[Chorus]
Homesick but it's alright
Lochloosa is on my mind
She's on my mind
Homesick but it's alright
Lochloosa is on my mind
She's on my mind
[Verse]
I swear it's ten thousand degrees in the shade
Lord have mercy knows
How much I love it
Every mosquito, every rattlesnake
Every cane break, everything (Oh, yeah, yeah)
Every alligator every black water swamp
Every freshwater spring, everything (Mm, mm)
All we need is one more damn developer
Tearin' her heart out (Oh, yeah, yeah)
All we need is one more Mickey Mouse
Another golf course
Another country club
Another gated community
Lord, I need her
Lord, I need her (Oh, yeah)
And she's gone away
If my grandfather could, lord, see her now
He'd lay down and die, lord yeah
Lord, he'd lay down and die
'Cause every minute, every second, every hour
Lord, every day, she's goin' away
Lord, she's goin' away[Chorus]
I'm homesick but it's alright
Lochloosa is on my mind, my mind, my mind
She's on my mind
Homesick but it's alright
Lochloosa is on my mind, my mind, my mind
She's on my mind
I'm homesick but it's alright
Lochloosa she's on my mind, my mind, my mind
She's on my mind
Homesick but it's alright
Lochloosa she's on my mind, my mind, my mind (Mm)
