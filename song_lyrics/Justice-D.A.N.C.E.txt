[Intro]
Do the D-A-N-C-E
One, two, three, four, fight!
Stick to the B-E-A-T
Get ready to ignite
You were such a P-Y-T
Catching all the lights
Just easy as A-B-C
That's how you make it right!
[Hook]
Do the D-A-N-C-E
One, two, three, four, fight!
Stick to the B-E-A-T
Get ready to ignite
You were such a P-Y-T
Catching all the lights
Just easy as A-B-C
That's how you make it right!
[Bridge]
Do the D-A-N-C-E
Stick to the B-E-A-T
Just easy as A-B-C
[Chorus]
Do the dance, do the dance
The way you move is a mystery
Do the dance
You're always there for music and me
Do the dance
The way you move is a mystery
Do the dance
You're always there for music and me
