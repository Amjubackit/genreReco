I swear it's my bad
I wasn't mad I just forgot to call back
Yeah, I'm not certain if you like me like that
Haven't felt so lonely since you fell in my lap
I feel it coming baby
Oooh
Do you like me even though I'm down bad
Just being honest with you
Lovin' you was a fever dream
We can forget everything
I won't tell my friends a thing
I'll keep it between you and me
I swear it's my bad
I wasn't mad I just forgot to call back
Yeah, I'm not certain if you like me like that
I haven't felt so lonely since you fell in my lap
I feel it coming baby
Oooh
You smoke my cigarette and givе it right back
Just the way you want it, baby
Lovin' you was a fever drеam
We can forget everything
I won't tell my friends a thing
I'll keep it between you and me
