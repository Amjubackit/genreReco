[Verse 1]
Now, Old Man River, what you doin' that for?
You know it ain't gonna help
Old man river got his hands in the mud
He's looking for gold in the wishing well
[Verse 2]

Hold me close on a winter night
Oh, Old Lady Wind, a vision of great heights
And marry her I just might
[Verse 3]
I drink coffee while she’s hangin' lights
Up on the Christmas tree
I’m not so lonely on those cold nights
Now that she’s holdin' me
[Verse 4]

You know it ain't gonna help
Old man river got his hands in the mud
He's looking for gold in the wishing well
