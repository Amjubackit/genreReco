[Verse 1]
We cloud people, we live in gray
Why we don't need release in rain?
We cloud people, we never stay
We hold our freedom like a plane
[Chorus]
We won't be dry soon
Here come the tides
You move when I do
You'll never be mine
We won't be dry soon
Here come the tides
You move when I do
You'll never be mine
[Verse 2]
I'm not supposed to feel
I'm not supposed to miss
How am I supposed to heal?
How am I supposed to fit?
A little awkward then
A little oxygen
I let you get away
I held the ocean in
[Verse 3]
We cloud people, we live in gray
If you love me let me float away
[Chorus]
We won't be dry soon (Won't be dry)
Here come the tides
You move when I do (Won't be mine)
You'll never be mine
We won't be dry soon (Won't be dry)
Here come the tides
You move when I do (Won't be mine)
You'll never be mine
We won't be dry soon (Won't be dry)
Here come the tides
You move when I do (Won't be mine)
You'll never be mine
