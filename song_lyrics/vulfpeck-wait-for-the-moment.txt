Mom said, "Wait for the moment!"
Gone home, went to bed
While the other kids, they're still outside
I don't feel time when I sleep
So I snuggle up with my sheet
And wait, for a brighter day
I'll play football tomorrow
With only my best friends
People I like, but I don't love, are not allowed
I wonder if Sharon will see me
But I'll play cool
'Cause cool is what you have to do
It's hard to make a point
When you're living so loud
Turn it down
Trying to get my friend excited
About not being invited
I say: "That's an opportunity!"
Butt dialed I smile
Listen dialed I smile
It was so nice to get a call
Sharon, I'm good at stuff
And you're into stuff (wooh)
Let's make products
I'm a product guy
You're a produce girl
I said money money money money money money will be spent
I'm attuned to the grooves
That turn you off
Bass man, break it down!

Let's make products
I'm a product kind of guy
And you're a produce kind of girl
I said money money money money money money will be spent
I'm attuned to the grooves
