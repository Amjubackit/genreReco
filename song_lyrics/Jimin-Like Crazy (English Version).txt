[Intro]
(
I think we could last forever
I'm afraid that everything will disappear
Just trust me
)
[Verse 1]
She's saying
Baby, come and follow me
There's not a bad thing here tonight
Save your reasons all for later
Stay with me a little while
[Verse 2]
Watch me go
Now, I sink down, all alone away
Where am I?
A dark haze clouding up my eyes
[Pre-Chorus]
I can hear the voices listening
Don't know who they are
Trying to take the pressure off
Been reaching for the stars
Tell me, will I find myself again?
When I go too far?
Yeah, I know
You know, I know (Ooh)
