[Intro]
Let's take a nice, deep breath
Slowly exhale
And take a nice, deep breath
[Verse: Denzel Curry]
The Big Bang happened when the black balloon ignited
I feel the pain shoulder to shoulder as I was knighted
The night turns to day and my days don't seem the brightest
It's like itis, I wanna take a bite out of what life is
If the President fuck around and piss off ISIS
Bury me in blueberry bills, jewels, and ices
Let's connect from mind to mind
Lies are on the rise, increasin', bigger size
Hard to victimize when evil's idolized
Inside my battered mind, I have visions of bein' broke
A broken man writin' words of wisdom inside these notes
Shattered and lost, chatterin' talk, blabberin' off
Grabbin' the cross, telling Jes√∫s nothing matters at all, ugh
The black balloon floats, the black balloon flies
The black balloon pops, the black balloon dies
I must be the black balloon and
The children of the world always meets a doomed end
The earth will soon end
We all perish, all parents, all kids, all buried
Cemetery, ceremonious, find me at my loneliest
Life is the ugliest bitch I ever messed with
But she quick to down that nut back like Nesquik
Never try to take my life, you get your chest hit
Countin' paper with Nyyjerya 'til my flesh split
Uh, uh, uh
