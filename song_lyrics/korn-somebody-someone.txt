[Verse 1]
I can't stand to let you win
I'm just watching you
And I don't know what to do
Feeling like a fool inside
Feeling all the love you hide
Thought you were my friend
Seems it never ends
[Pre-Chorus]
I need somebody, someone
[Chorus]
Can't somebody help me?
All I need is to be
Loved just for me
[Verse 2]
Giving you with this and that
Giving gave nothing back
It's all related to
All the things I do
Feeling like a fool inside
Seeing all the things you tried
I am nothing[Pre-Chorus]
I need somebody, someone
[Chorus]
Can't somebody help me?
All I need is to be
Loved just for me
[Bridge]
I look, I sign
I need someone
Inside to help me out
With what I'm trying
I'm crying, I'm prying
In a pile of shit
I'm dying
I'm dying
I'm dying!
[Outro]
I need somebody! (somebody!)
Somebody! (somebody!)
Someone!
I need somebody! (somebody!)
Somebody! (somebody!)
Someone!
Someone!
