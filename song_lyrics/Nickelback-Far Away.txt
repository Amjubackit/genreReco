[Verse 1]
This time, this place
Misused, mistakes
Too long, too late
Who was I to make you wait?
Just one chance, just one breath
Just in case there's just one left
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you know
You know, you know
[Chorus]
I love you
I loved you all along
And I miss you
Been far away for far too long
I keep dreaming you'll be with me
And you'll never go
Stop breathing
If I don't see you anymore
[Verse 2]
On my knees, I'll ask
Last chance for one last dance
'
Cause with you, I'd withstand
All of Hell to hold your hand
I'd give it all, I'd give for us
Give anything, but I won't give up
