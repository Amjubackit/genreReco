[Verse 1: Lukas Nelson, Lainey Wilson, Lukas Nelson & Lainey Wilson]
Let's pretend we're more than friends tonight
Let's pretend and let each other in
[Chorus: Lukas Nelson & Lainey Wilson]
Forget tomorrow
We can face the music then
But I promise you, tonight will never end
If we pretend
We're more than friends
[Verse 2: Lainey Wilson, Lukas Nelson]
Let's let go of what we used to know
Let's let go and let our feelings show
[Chorus: Lukas Nelson & Lainey Wilson]
Forget tomorrow
We can face the music then
But I promise you, tonight will nеver end
If we prеtend
We're more than friends
[Instrumental Break]
[Bridge: Lukas Nelson & Lainey Wilson, Lainey Wilson]
Let's pretend we're more than friends tonight (Woo)
Let's pretend and let our bodies win
[Chorus: Lukas Nelson & Lainey Wilson]
Forget tomorrow
We can face the music then
But I promise you, tonight will never end
If we pretend
We're more than friends
Forget tomorrow
We can face the music then
But I promise you, tonight will never end
If we pretend
We're more than friends
