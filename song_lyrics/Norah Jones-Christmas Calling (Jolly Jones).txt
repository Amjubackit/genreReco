[Verse 1]
I wanna hear the music play
I wanna dance and laugh and sway
I want a happy holiday
For Christmas
I could call you on the phone
Sing a song, it feels like home
Instead of feeling all alone
This Christmas
[Pre-Chorus]
And the snow is falling, can't you see?
Is it Christmas calling out to me?
[Chorus]
If I could be with you tonight
Beside a fire shining bright
I'd open up to all of your light
This Christmas
This mistletoe hangs over me
I'm looking all around for glee
So Santa, give me what I need
For Christmas
[Bridge]
And the friends who feel like family
With their secret angels holding me?
And the snow is falling, can't you see?
Is it Christmas calling out to me?
Is it Christmas calling out to me?
Is it Christmas calling out to me?
