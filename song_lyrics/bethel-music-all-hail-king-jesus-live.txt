[Verse 1]
There was a moment when the lights went out
When death had claimed its victory
The King of love had given up His life
The darkest day in history
There on a cross they made for sinners
For every curse His blood atoned
One final breath and it was finished
But not the end we could have known
[Pre-Chorus 1]
For the earth began to shake
And the veil was torn
What sacrifice was made
As the heavens roared
[Chorus]
All hail King Jesus
All hail the Lord of Heaven and earth
All hail King Jesus
All hail the Savior of the world
[Verse 2]
There was a moment when the sky lit up
A flash of light breaking through
When all was lost He crossed eternity
The King of life was on the move
[Pre-Chorus 2]
For in a dark, cold tomb
Where our Lord was laid
One miraculous breath
And weâ€™re forever changed
[Chorus]
All hail King Jesus
All hail the Lord of Heaven and earth
All hail King Jesus
All hail the Savior of the world
All hail King Jesus
All hail the Lord of Heaven and earth
All hail King Jesus
All hail the Savior of the world
[Bridge]
Let every knee come bow before the King of Kings
Let every tongue confess that He is Lord
Lift up your shout, let us join with all of Heaven
Singing holy, singing holy
Cry out holy, singing holy
[Chorus]
All hail King Jesus
All hail the Lord of Heaven and earth
All hail King Jesus
All hail the Savior of the world
