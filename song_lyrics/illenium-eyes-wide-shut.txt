[Intro]
I say I love you, but I don't
I say I'm fine, but I'm miserable
[Verse 1]
I'm dead, but you probably can't tell
Been scalin' the walls of the wishin' well
My head's in the sky, but I'm fallin' backwards, yeah
Night crawlin', I'm wide awake in my dreams
Wake up and I don't know what anything means
We're completely different people than the people we wanted
[Pre-Chorus]
Have we outgrown this city? I'm so tired
Of wishin' I was somewhere different than where you are
With my eyes wide shut
[Chorus]
I say I love you, but I don't
I say I'm fine, but I'm miserable
Oh, 'cause I don't get high off you anymore
No, I don't get high off you anymore
[Verse 2]
Smilin' into the mirror like a psychopath
Can't remember the last time you made me laugh
Drawing tears with my lipstick, you're the first on my hit list[Pre-Chorus]
Have we outgrown this city? I'm so tired
Of wishin' I was somewhere different than where you are
With my eyes wide shut
[Chorus]
I say I love you, but I don't
I say I'm fine, but I'm miserable
Oh, 'cause I don't get high off you anymore
No, I don't get high off you
[Bridge]
Have we outgrown this city?
Wish I was somewhere different from where you are
Have we outgrown this city?
Or have I gone missin' in the dark?
[Chorus]
I say I love you, but I don't (But I don't)
I say I'm fine, but I'm miserable (I'm miserable)
Oh, 'cause I don't get high off you anymore
No, I don't get high off you (I don't get, I don't get)
Anymore
