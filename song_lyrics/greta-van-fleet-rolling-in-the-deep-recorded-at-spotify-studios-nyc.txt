[Verse 1]
There's a fire burning in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch that's bringing me out the dark
Finally, I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out, I'll lay your shit to bare
See me leaving with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire burning in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch that's bringing me out the dark
[Pre-Chorus]
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
They keep me thinking
[Chorus]
We could've had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
And you played it to the beat
[Verse 2]
Throw your soul through every open door
Count your blessings to find what you're looking for
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold
You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow[Pre-Chorus]
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
They keep me thinking
[Chorus]
We could've had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it to the beat
[Instrumental]
[Chorus]
We could've had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
And you played it to the beat
