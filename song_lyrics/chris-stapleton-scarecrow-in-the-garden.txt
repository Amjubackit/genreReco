[Verse 1]
Well he came from Northern Ireland
Searching for the free man's ground
And he came to bet his fortune
On a West Virginia plow
He built a house of timber
And raised a redhead son
Then they worked the land together
And prayed the rain would come
[Chorus]
There's a scarecrow in the garden
That looks like Lucifer
And I've been reading Revelations
With my bare feet in the dirt
[Verse 2]
Well the redhead son got older
And took a brown eyed wife
And the fields were green as dollars
Cause the dirt was black as night
I came in late September
The youngest one of three
And my sisters off and married
So the land was left to me[Chorus]
There's a scarecrow in the garden
That looks like Lucifer
And I've been reading Revelations
With my bare feet in the dirt
[Bridge]
I know every single fencepost
Every rock that goes around
I've been staring at the red oak
Where I know they'll lay me down
[Verse 3]
The fields ain't what they once were
The rains just seem to flood
And I've been thinking about that river
Wondering how it turned to blood
[Outro]
I've been sitting here all morning
I was sitting here all night
There's a bible in my left hand
And a pistol in my right
