[Verse: Dragonette]
I met a guy with a loaded gun
Hands up I got shaken right again
Trigger finger you are fucked
[Refrain: Dragonette]
You go off in every direction
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Do let conscience divide us
Get ready and, and fire
We face our feelings, high race babe
[Chorus: Dragonette]
Head to head
Neck and neck
We face our feelings, high race babe
Head to head
Neck and neck
(...)
Head to head
Neck and neck
(...)
Head to Head
Neck and neck
Do it up just to come on down
I live for a little, can't say I'm no fun
And then I follow one by one
So what's the senses
Mounts on the fences
[Pre-Chorus 2: Dragonette]
Don't mess with my desire
Get ready and, and fire
Oh the face our feelings high race baby we go
Head to head
Neck and neck
[Chorus: Dragonette]
We face our feelings, high race babe
Head to head
Neck and neck
(...)
Head to head
Neck and neck
(...)
Head to head
Neck and neck
