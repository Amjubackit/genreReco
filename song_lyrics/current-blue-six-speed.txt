[Chorus]
Do you remember backseat in my BMW
Six speed, too fast, no such thing
I could never slow down
I could never slow down
[Verse 1]
Yeah I know that shit gets rough
But I promise you that it'll be fine
Yeah
[Chorus]
Do you remember backseat in my BMW
Six speed, too fast, no such thing
I could never slow down
I could never slow down
[Post-Chorus]
I know I fuck up sometimes
If it's alright with you then it's alright with me yeah
I know I fuck up sometimes
If it's alright with you then it's alright with me yeah
[Verse 2]
And you can tell me pull up to your house right now
You can find me on the I-26 westbound
Girl we got a good thing going
Oh I get you, girl you know Iâ€™m into you yeahMiss me with that bullshit ooh ya
Lately I've been [?]
You can't say shit to me
I've been on the road, on the road ahh
I've been getting dough in my BMW
[Chorus]
Do you remember backseat in my BMW
Six speed, too fast, no such thing
I could never slow down
I could never slow down
[Post-Chorus]
I know I fuck up sometimes
If it's alright with you then it's alright with me yeah
I know I fuck up sometimes
If it's alright with you then it's alright with me yeah
