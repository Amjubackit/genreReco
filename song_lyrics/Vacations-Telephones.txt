[Verse 1]
Rise with the morning
You call to me
My thoughts are crawling
You're all I see
[Chorus]
I wish I could live without you
But you're a part of me
Wherever I go
You'll always be next to me
[Verse 2]
Fall into the night
As I gaze into you
Shine so bright
It's all I do
[Chorus]
I wish I could live without you
But you're a part of me
Wherever I go
You'll always be next to me
[Outro]
You'll always be next to me
You'll always be next to me
You'll always be next to me
You'll always be next to me
