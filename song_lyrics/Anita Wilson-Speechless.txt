I can say that You're wonderful
But it doesn't seem good enough
I can say that You're kind
But that would miss the mark
I can say that You're beautiful
But to me You are so much more
How do I communicate exactly who You are?
I'm trying to convey the sentiment of my heart, and say
I really do appreciate the way You brighten up my day
I can't find the words to describe You
It would take a million years
It would take a million years to explain the way I feel
You are the epitome, You are the epitome of everything I'll ever need
I'm so in awe of You, Lord You leave me speechless
Now if I had more time
I would go down the line
And name all the things that captivate my heart
But clearly I'm not aware of words that can compare
How do I communicate exactly who You are?
I'm trying to convey the sentiment of my heart, and say
I really do appreciate the way You brighten up my day
