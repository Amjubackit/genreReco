[Verse 1]
Woke up late today and I
Still feel the sting of the pain, but I
Brushed my teeth anyway
I got dressed through the mess and put a smile on my face
I got a little bit stronger
[Verse 2]
Ridin' in the car to work and I'm
Tryin' to ignore the hurt, so I
Turned on the radio
Stupid song made me think of you
I listened to it for a minute
But then I changed it
I'm gettin' a little bit stronger
Just a little bit stronger
[Chorus]
And I'm done hopin'
That we could work it out
I'm done with how it feels
Spinnin' my wheels
Lettin' you drag my heart around, and oh
And I'm done thinkin'
That you could ever change
I know my heart will never be the same
But I'm tellin' myself I'll be okay
Even on my weakest days
I get a little bit stronger
