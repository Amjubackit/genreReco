[Verse 1]
You look so much different out of the rear view
From this angle and the back of your head
It looks a lot like somebody else
And I guess that I could go it alone, well if I had to
But I know it’s a long way down for nothing (Yeah)
[Chorus]
The sight of your eyes got inside of my head
I wanted your heart and got poison instead
I spin around and see nothing but you
I guess it’s been awhile since I had nothing to do
[Verse 2]
Not that it matters but I think there is a reason that your life is so shattered
And it’s small, remember how big it used to be
And I guess that I could go it alone well if I had to
But I keep thinking that
I know it’s a long way down for nothing
(I know it’s a long way down for nothing)
[Chorus]
The sight of your eyes got inside of my head
I wanted your heart and got poison instead
I spin around and see nothing but you
I guess it’s been awhile since I had nothing to do, yeah
I guess it’s been awhile since I had nothing to do, yeah
I guess it’s been awhile since I had nothing[Bridge]
Brace yourself for the landing
You know you’ve gotta brace yourself for the landing
More like a crash
More like a crash
[Chorus]
The sight of your eyes got inside of my head
I wanted your heart and got poison instead
I spin around and see nothing but you
I guess it’s been awhile since I had nothing to do, yeah
I guess it’s been awhile since I had nothing to do, yeah
I guess it’s been awhile since I had nothing
