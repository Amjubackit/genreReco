[Verse 1]
Are you serious? Are you kiddin' me?
What's the deal?
Oh no, no (Yeah)
This the one you talking 'bout that's supposed to take my place, damn, is this for real? (Hmm)
It's almost disrespectful
[Pre-Chorus]
That's a downgrade and you know it
Still your best, me, still your best, me
[Chorus]
When you wanna come back? (Yeah)
I lay you back on your back and do you just like that
Missed the way that I grabbed (Yeah)
Your body knows me, yes
I'm still your best, best, best
[Post-Chorus]
I don't want your heart (Heart)
Maybe once before (Go)
I don't want you back (Back)
Just wanna let you know (Know)
Say my love is bad (Bad)
So you let me go (Go)
But my love is more (More)
Just wanna let you know (Know)
I don't want your heart (Heart)
Maybe once before (Go)
I don't want you back (Back)
Just wanna let you know (Know)
Say my love is bad (Bad)
So you let me go (Go)
But my love is more (More)
Just wanna let you know (Know)[Verse 2]
Still your best I know, love it or hate it
It's unfair I know, that I got away
Just confess right now, go ahead and say it (Go ahead and say it)
Go ahead and say it (Go ahead and say it)
Baby, it's okay (Baby)
[Pre-Chorus]
That's a downgrade and you know it
I'm still your best, oh, I'm still your best, oh, oh
[Chorus]
When you wanna come back? (Yeah)
I lay you back on your back and do you just like that
Missed the way that I grabbed (Yeah)
Your body knows me, yes
I'm still your best, best, best
[Post-Chorus]
I don't want your heart (Heart)
Maybe once before (Go)
I don't want you back (Back)
Just wanna let you know (Know)
Say my love is bad (Bad)
So you let me go (Go)
But my love is more (More)
Just wanna let you know (Know)
I don't want your heart (Heart)
Maybe once before (Go)
I don't want you back (Back)
Just wanna let you know (Know)
Say my love is bad (Bad)
So you let me go (Go)
But my love is more (More)
Just wanna let you know (Know)[Outro]
Maybe once before
Just wanna let you know
So you let me go
Just wanna let you know
