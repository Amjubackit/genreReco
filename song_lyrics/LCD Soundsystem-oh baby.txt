[Verse 1]
Oh baby
Oh baby
You're having a bad dream
Here in my arms
[Verse 2]
Oh sugar
You came to me
Could all be a bad thing
Doing you harm
Oh oh oh
[Verse 3]
Oh lover
You run from me
We move like a bad scene
Shot in the dark
[Chorus 1]
Oh, but please
Please wake me
But my love lies patiently
Please baby, please
And my love life waits for me
