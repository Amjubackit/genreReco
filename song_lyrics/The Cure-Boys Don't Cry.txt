[Verse 1]
I would say I'm sorry
If I thought that it would change your mind
But I know that this time
I have said too much, been too unkind
[Chorus]
I tried to laugh about it
Cover it all up with lies
I tried to laugh about it
Hiding the tears in my eyes
'Cause boys don't cry
Boys don't cry
[Verse 2]
I would break down at your feet
And beg forgiveness, plead with you
But I know that it's too late
And now there's nothing I can do
[Chorus]
So I try to laugh about it
Cover it all up with lies
I try to laugh about it
Hiding the tears in my eyes
'Cause boys don't cry
Boys don't cry
