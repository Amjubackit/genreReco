[Verse 1]
There is a river where goodness flows
There is a fountain that drowns sorrows
There is an ocean deeper than fear
The tide is rising, rising
[Verse 2]
There is a current stirring deep inside
It's overflowing from the heart of God
The flood of heaven crashing over us
The tide is rising, rising
[Pre-Chorus]
Bursting, bursting
Up from the ground, we feel it now
Bursting, bursting
Up from the ground, we feel it now
[Chorus]
We come alive in the river
We come alive in the river
We come alive in the river
We come alive in the river
[Verse 2]
There is a current stirring deep inside
It's overflowing from the heart of God
The flood of heaven crashing over us
The tide is rising, rising
[Pre-Chorus]
Bursting, bursting
Up from the ground, we feel it now
Bursting, bursting
Up from the ground, we feel it now
[Chorus]
We come alive in the river
We come alive in the river
We come alive in the river
We come alive in the river
[Bridge]
Break open prison doors
Set all the captives free
Spring up a well, spring up a well
Spring up a well in me
Nothing can stop this joy
We're dancing in the streets
Spring up a well, spring up a well
Spring a well in me
[Chorus]
We come alive in the river
We come alive in the river
We come alive in the river
We come alive in the river
[Outro]
Spring up a well
Spring up a well
Spring up a well, spring up a well
Spring up a well in me
We come alive in the river
We come alive in the river
We come alive in the river
We come alive in the river
