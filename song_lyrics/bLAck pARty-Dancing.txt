[Intro]
(Da, da, da-da, da, da, da-da)
(Da, da, da-da, da, da, da-da)
(Da, da, da-da, da, da, da-da)
(Da, da, da-da, da, da, da-da)
[Verse 1]
Ayy, can I talk to you?
Girl, I seen you dancing right here with your crew
It was your smile that brought me here to you
But maybe it's the way you hid your moves
Tell me, do you have a boo?
And if not, then I wanna dance with you
You're so gorgeous that it's hard to keep my cool
But I'll keep it just to have a dance with you
[Chorus]
Darling, tell me, can I talk to you?
I seen you dancing from across the room
And told myself I gotta know, I gotta know you
I gotta know, I gotta know you
[Verse 2]
Hey, can I walk you to
Your car and maybe we can get some food
But you won't break my heart if you decline, it's cool
But I honestly wanna end my night with you (Ayy)
