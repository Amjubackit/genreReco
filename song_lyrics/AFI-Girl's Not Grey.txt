[Verse 1]
I'll lay me down tonight
Much further down
Swim in the calm tonight
This art does drown
[Chorus]
(What follows) me as the whitest lace of light
(Will swallow whole) just begs to be imbrued
(What follows) has led me to this place
Where I belong, with all erased
What follows
[Verse 2]
All insects sing tonight
The coldest sound
I'd send God's grace tonight
Could it be found?
[Chorus]
(What follows) me as the whitest lace of light
(Will swallow whole) just begs to be imbrued
(What follows) has led me to this place
Where I belong, with all erased
[Bridge]
I'll lay me down tonight
Much further down
Watch stars go out tonight
On sinking ground
