[Intro]
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
[Verse 1]
I've got that lightnin' inside me
Son of a God
I'm like a titan that's risin'
Oh just you watch
I'm steppin' into fate
There is no time to waste
I've got that lightnin' inside me
This is how legends are made
[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
This is how legends are made
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
This is how legends are made
[Verse 2]
I'm crankin' up on the throttle
Victory is mine
Show you the harder the battle
The harder I fight
I've come too far to quit
Step back I'm goin' in
I'm crankin' up on the throttle
This is how legends are made
