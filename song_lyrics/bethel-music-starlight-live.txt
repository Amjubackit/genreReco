[Verse 1]
You're like starlight in the dark
Endless miles can't conceal You
And every glimmer is a spark
Catching fire as You break through
[Chorus]
Oh, You're not far away
You're coming close
And oh, even as I wait
You're coming close
[Verse 2]
You're like summer in the night
The sun goes down but still I feel You
And every shadow's turning bright
Every broken heart is made new
[Chorus]
Oh, You're not far away
You're coming close
And oh, even as I wait
You're coming close
[Interlude][Bridge]
And there's no heart unseen
There's no space between
You and I
You and I
You are closer than
The very oxygen
I'm breathing in
Oh, I breathe You in
You are God with us
You are here with us
Immanuel!
Immanuel!
You are infinite
Your glory has no end
Jesus!
Jesus!
[Interlude]
[Bridge]
There's no heart unseen
There's no space between
You and I
You and I
'Cause You are closer than
The very oxygen
I'm breathing in
Oh, I breath You in
You are God with us
You are here with us
Immanuel!
Immanuel!
You are infinite
Your glory has no end
Jesus!
Jesus![Chorus]
Oh, You're not far away
You're coming close
And oh, even as I wait
You're coming close
[Outro]
'Cause You're like starlight in the dark
Endless miles can't conceal You
And every glimmer is a spark
Catching fire as You break through
