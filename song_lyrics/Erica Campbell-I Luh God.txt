[Intro: Big Shizz]
What? EC
Check it out, yeah
[Chorus: Erica Campbell]
I love God, you don't love God?
What's wrong with you?
I love God, you don't love God?
What's wrong with you?
[Verse 1: Erica Campbell]
I don't think that I could live no other way
Truth be told, I'm livin' how I wanna, ayy
Nah, this ain't them blessings in the modern day
The Lord I serve, He gives 'em to me every day
[Pre-Chorus: Erica Campbell]
I'm forgiven, I'm forgiven (Ayy, ayy)
See, I done been forgiven, now I'm livin' (Ayy, ayy)
And when I say I love, I mean it
'Cause none of this means nothin' if He comes and I miss Him, shawty
[Chorus: Erica Campbell]
I luh God, you don't luh God?
What's wrong with you?
I luh God, you don't luh God?
What's wrong with you?
