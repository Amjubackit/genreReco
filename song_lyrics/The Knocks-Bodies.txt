[Verse 1]
It's another suburban summer
The street lights blink on
If you're passing the house on the corner
You'd think no one's home
[Pre-Chorus]
But when I feel that resonation
Waving with the weight from
Bodies in the basement
And when you swing my way won't
Wait no way, no way, want
Bodies in the basement
[Chorus]
When I feel that 8-0-8 drum
Waving with the weight from
Bodies in the basement
And when you swing my way won't
Wait no way, no way, want
Bodies in the basement
[Break]
[Post-Chorus]
Your body on my, body on my
My bodies in the basement
Your body on my, body on my
Bodies in the basement
