[Refrain: The Weeknd]
I'm good, I'm good, I'm great
Know it's been a while, now I'm mixin' up the drank
I just need a girl who gon' really understand
I just need a girl who gon' really understand
I'm good, I'm good, I'm great
Know it's been a while, now I'm mixin' up the drank
I just need a girl who gon' really understand
I just need a girl who gon' really understand
[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
And I seen her get rich hittin' the pole
I've seen her, I knew she had to know
I've seen her take down that tequila
Down by the liter, I knew I had to meet her
Ooh, she mine, ooh, girl, bump and grind
Ooh, she mine, ooh, girl, bump a line
Angelina, lips like Angelina
Like Selena, ass shaped like Selena
[Chorus: The Weeknd]
I'm like, got up, thank the Lord for the day
Woke up by a girl, I don't even know her name
Woke up by a girl, I don't even know her name
(Woke up, woke up by a girl, I don't even know her name)
Got up, thank the Lord for the day
Woke up by a girl, I don't even know her name
Woke up by a girl, I don't even know her name
(Woke up, woke up by a girl, I don't even know her name)
