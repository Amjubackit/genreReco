[Verse 1]
Who is the great King of glory
Seated on high in the heavens?
Oh-oh-ohh, Jesus, You alone
You are the Lord God Almighty
Strong in compassion and mercy
Oh-oh-ohh, Jesus, You alone
[Pre-Chorus]
I've searched the world for a love that could fill my heart
But nothing compares to the wonder of who You are
[Chorus]
Holy, all the earth singing
Holy, all the angels cry
Holy, Jesus, You alone
Jesus, You alone, oh
We lift You high
[Verse 2]
You set the stars in the heavens
You set the world into motion
Oh-oh-ohh, Jesus, You alone
You breathed Your life in creation
You walked among Your created
Oh-oh-ohh, Jesus, You alone
[Pre-Chorus]
And Iâ€™ve searched the world for a love that could fill my heart
Oh, but nothing compares to the wonder of who You are
[Chorus]
Holy, all the earth singing
Holy, all the angels cry
Holy, Jesus, You alone
Worthy, all creation sings
Worthy, all the heavens
Exalt Thee, Jesus, You alone
Jesus, You alone
[Verse 3]
You shed Your blood for salvation
You broke the curse for our freedom
Oh-oh-ohh, Jesus, You alone
You rose from death with the morning
You'll come again in Your glory
Ohh-oh-ohh, Jesus, You alone
Ohh-oh-ohh, Jesus, You alone
[Chorus]
Holy, all the earth singing
Holy, all the angels cry
Holy, Jesus, You alone
Worthy, all creation sings
Worthy, all the heavens
Exalt Thee, Jesus, You alone
Holy, all the earth singing
Holy, all the angels cry
Holy, Jesus, You alone
Can we lift our voices and sing?
Worthy, all creation sings
Worthy, all the heavens
Exalt Thee, Jesus, You alone
[Chorus]
Holy, I can't help but sing
Holy, how my heart cries out
Holy, Jesus, You alone
Sing to Jesus
Worthy, I lift my voice and sing
Worthy, I bow my life to
Exalt Thee, Jesus, You alone
Jesus, You alone
