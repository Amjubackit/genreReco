[Verse 1]
Who is the great King of glory
Seated on high in the heavens?
Oh-oh-ohh, Jesus, You alone
You are the Lord God Almighty
Strong in compassion and mercy
Oh-oh-ohh, Jesus, You alone
[Pre-Chorus]
I've searched the world for a love that could fill my heart
But nothing compares to the wonder of who You are
[Chorus]
Holy, all the earth singing
Holy, all the angels cry
Holy, Jesus, You alone
Jesus, You alone, oh
We lift You high
[Verse 2]
You set the stars in the heavens
You set the world into motion
Oh-oh-ohh, Jesus, You alone
You breathed Your life in creation
You walked among Your created
Oh-oh-ohh, Jesus, You alone
