[Verse 1: Mark Foster]
Days, they can feel so long
I've been hangin' on to a sad love song
Nights never came to dawn
They went on and on
When you pulled me out
[Chorus: Mark Foster]
And before I knew it
I became all about you
I became all about you
And before I knew it
I became all about you
I became all about you
[Post-Chorus: Christ Choir]
Just like a ship
Without a sail
Just like a ship
Without a sail
[Verse 2: Mark Foster]
Days, they felt so lost
I was so far gone
Hangin' upside down
Nights were only friend
My distraction
When you pulled me out
[Chorus: Mark Foster]
And before I knew it
I became all about you
I became all about you
And before I knew it
I became all about you
I became all about you
[Post-Chorus: Mark Foster & Christ Choir]
Before I knew it (Just like a ship)
Before I knew it (Without a sail)
He was nothin' to her (Just like a ship)
Before I knew it (Without a sail)
I became all about you (But I know we can make it)
All about you (But I know we can make it)
All about you (But I know we can make it)
All about you (But I know we can make it)
I said
[Instrumental Break]
[Outro: Mark Foster & Christ Choir]
And before I knew it
I became all about you (Just like a ship)
I became all about you (Without a sail)
I became all about you (Just like a ship)
I became all about you (Without a sail)
