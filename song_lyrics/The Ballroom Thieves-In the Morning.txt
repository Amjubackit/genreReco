We don’t need it
Is it clear to see that now
In the driving rain
With the river running wild
We don’t want it
Put a name back on it now
With the sun gone down
And the river running wild
Come see me in the morning
And I’ll hold my head up high
What I need to understand
Is how hope fits in my hand
Then I’ll hold it tight
All through the night
I don’t buy it
There’s no need to try it out
And I won’t pretend
That we’re dancing in the dark
So just be honest
Like a child again somehow
Cause you can’t go back
With the river running wild
