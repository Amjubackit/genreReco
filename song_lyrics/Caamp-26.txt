[Verse 1]
Well I found out yesterday
That I'm in love
And I don't know what else to say
But thank you Lord
For that sundress on that Saturday
Walkin' barefoot down the beach
[Pre-Chorus]
Smell of the rain up in the air
Smell the flowers in her hair
And I swear on my life
If you need a joke? I'll be there
You need a smoke? Here take my spare
I always thought that you were fine
[Chorus]
So whaddaya' say when we're 26
Get married just for kicks and
Move out to Alaska way up there
I'll get a job stacking bricks
You stay at home with the kids and
I'll bring the bacon back home to you girl
We're making the best of this world
[Interlude]
