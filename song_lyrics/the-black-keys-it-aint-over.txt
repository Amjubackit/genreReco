[Verse 1]
Money and love ain't no sure thing
You live for a thrill, you die for a dream
And when it comes around, you lay your money down
You got a love that's a real long shot
Breakin' the bank for your new weak spot
When she comes around, you lay your money down
[Chorus]
No one else for you to blame
But when you play that losing game
It ain't over
So try to ease a worried mind
Dreams come true from time to time
It ain't over
[Verse 2]
What are the odds if you let them go
Win or lose, it's gonna take your soul
And you can't turn around, lay your money down
Onе up your sleeve might getcha two in your chest
Hurting your hеart but baby knows best
And when she comes around, you lay your money down
[Chorus]
No one else for you to blame
But when you play that losing game
It ain't over
So try to ease a worried mind
Dreams come true from time to time
It ain't over[Chorus]
No one else for you to blame
But when you play that losing game
It ain't over
So try to ease a worried mind
Dreams come true from time to time
It ain't over
[Outro]
No one else for you to blame
But when you play that losing game
It ain't over
