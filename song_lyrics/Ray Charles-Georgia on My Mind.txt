[Verse 1]
Georgia
Georgia
The whole day through
(The whole day through)
Just an old, sweet song
Keeps Georgia on my mind
(Georgia on my mind)
[Verse 2]
I said a-Georgia
Georgia
A song of you
(A song of you)
Comes as sweet and clear
As moonlight through the pines
[Refrain]
Other arms a-reach out to me
Other eyes smile tenderly
Still, in the peaceful dreams, I see
The road leads back to you
[Verse 3]
I said, Georgia, oh, Georgia
No peace I find (No peace I find)
Just an old, sweet song
Keeps Georgia on my mind
(Georgia on my mind, oh)
