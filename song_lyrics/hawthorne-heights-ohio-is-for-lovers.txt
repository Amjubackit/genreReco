[Verse 1]
Hey, there
I know it's hard to feel like I don't care at all
Where you are and how you feel
With these lights off as these wheels
Keep rolling on and on and on and on and on
Slow things down or speed them up
Not enough or way too much
And on and on and on, how are you when I'm gone?
[Chorus]
And I can't make it on my own
(And I can't make it on my own)
Because my heart is in Ohio
So cut my wrists and black my eyes
(Cut my wrists and black my eyes)
So I can fall asleep tonight, or die
[Post-Chorus]
Because you kill me
You know you do, you kill me well
You like it too, and I can tell
You'll never stop until my final breath is gone
[Verse 2]
Spare me just three last words, "I love you" is all she heard
I'll wait for you, but I can't wait forever
Spare me just three last words, "I love you" is all she heard
I'll wait for you, but I can't wait forever
