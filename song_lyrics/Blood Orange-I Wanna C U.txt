I see you runnin' out the window
Brain is runnin’ like it's hidin' from the night
I think of something, I overthink it
Brain is runnin’ like it's runnin' from the night
I wanna see you
And keep it in your home
I wanna see you (
I wanna see you
)
And keep it in your home
I wanna see you (
I wanna see you
)
And keep it in your home
I wanna see you
And keep it in your home
And keep it in your home
