[Verse 1]
I gave it hell on Friday nights
All about that single life
I gave my mama a reason to pray
Didn't care about tryin' to change, no
I gave my all to those empty bars
They always left me with a broken heart
Never really ever gave love a thought
Man, as soon as I swore it off
[Chorus]
God gave me a girl, girl gave me a kiss
Kiss gave me a feelin' that I still get
Every time I look in her eyes
I don't deserve her and I don't know why
She gave mе her hand, I gave her a ring
Thеn as soon as I could, I gave her my last name
Now I'm gonna give her forever
I knew what I wanted but He knew better
God gave me a girl, mm-mm
[Verse 2]
The boys gave me a hard time
'Cause I was givin' her all of mine
But the first time they met her is when they understood
Said, "How'd you get one so good?"
[Chorus]
God gave me a girl, girl gave me a kiss
Kiss gave me a feelin' that I still get
Every time I look in her eyes
I don't deserve her and I don't know why
She gave me her hand, I gave her a ring
Then as soon as I could, I gave her my last name
Now I'm gonna give her forever
I knew what I wanted but He knew better
[Bridge]
God gave me a girl at just the right time
And I'd give her the world 'cause she changed mine
[Chorus]
God gave me a girl, girl gave me a kiss
Kiss gave me a feelin' that I still get
Every time I look in her eyes
I don't deserve her and I don't know why
She gave me her hand, I gave her a ring
Then as soon as I could, I gave her my last name
Now I wanna give her forever
I knew what I wanted but He knew better
God gave me a girl
God gave me a girl
[Outro]
(Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
God gave me a girl
