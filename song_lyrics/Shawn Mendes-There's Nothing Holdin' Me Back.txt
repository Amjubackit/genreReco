[Verse 1]
I wanna follow where she goes
I think about her and she knows it
I wanna let her take control
'Cause everytime that she gets close, yeah
[Pre-Chorus]
She pulls me in enough to keep me guessin' (Mmmm)
And maybe I should stop and start confessin', confessing, yeah
[Chorus]
Oh, I've been shaking
I love it when you go crazy
You take all my inhibitions
Baby, there's nothin' holdin' me back
You take me places that tear up my reputation
Manipulate my decisions
Baby, there's nothin' holdin' me back
There's nothin' holdin' me back
There's nothin' holdin' me back
[Verse 2]
She says that she's never afraid
Just picture everybody naked
She really doesn't like to wait
Not really into hesitation
