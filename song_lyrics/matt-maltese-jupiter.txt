[Verse 1]
In every dream I have, you're in the car
You're not with him no more, yes it's just us
In every dream I have, you're at the bar
Drinking White Russians with me, it's just us
[Chorus]
I need you like a fire needs a log
Jupiter couldn't keep me from you
Oh, I'm yours
I want you like a dog wants a dog
Jupiter couldn't keep me from you
Oh, I'm yours
[Verse 2]
You say hello and I'm nothing at all
I wanna be the screen you always touch
And I'd even be an ulcer in your mouth
Just to be close to you, I'm just so far
[Chorus]
I need you like a fire needs a log
Jupiter couldn't keep me from you
Oh, I'm yours
I want you like a dog wants a dog
Jupiter couldn't keep me from you
Oh, I'm yours[Outro]
I need you like a shore needs a rock
Jupiter couldn't keep me from you
Oh, I'm yours
I want you like a dove wants a dove
Jupiter couldn't keep me from you
Oh, I'm yours
