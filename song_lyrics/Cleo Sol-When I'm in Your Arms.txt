[Verse 1]
Old wounds, old fights
Another day goes by
I'm not playing by their rules
They can't take me for no fool
[Verse 2]
Are you gonna rock with me?
Hold me down?
Will you listen?
Ever lie to me?
This is all the sign I need
[Chorus]
So tell me
Will you keep me safe
When I'm in your arms?
I'm in your arms
[Post-Chorus]
Control me
'Cause it feels so good
When I'm in your arms
[Verse 4]
I don't want you going nowhere
'Cause on the corners of you mind
Helps my body to unwind
Don't waste time
