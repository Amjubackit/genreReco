[Verse 1]
Youngblood thinks there's always tomorrow
I miss your touch on  nights when I'm hollow
I know you crossed a bridge that I can't follow
Since the love that you left is all that I get, I want you to know
[Chorus]
That if I can't be close to you, I'll settle for the ghost of you
I miss you more than life
And if you can't be next to me, your memory is ecstasy
I miss you more than life
[Verse 2]
Youngblood thinks there's always tomorrow
I need more time, but time can't be borrowed
I'd leave it all behind if I could follow
But  the love that you left is all that I get
So  I want you to know
[Chorus]
That if I can't be close to you, I'll settle for the ghost of you
I miss you more than life
And if you can't be next to me, your memory is ecstasy
I miss you more than life
