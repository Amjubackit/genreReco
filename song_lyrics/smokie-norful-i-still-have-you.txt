[Verse 1]
I'm at my best when I'm at my worst
I passed the test even when I don't come in first
And sometimes I win when the score says I lose
'Cause even in my weakness, I still have You
[Verse 2]
I still have joy when I'm feeling pain
I'm moving up when my life has clearly fallen down again
Sometimes I win when the score says You lose
'Cause even in my weakness, I still have You
[Chorus]
You are the one who puts the light in the sun
You're the one who drapes the stars in the sky when the sun is done
Yet Your majesty sees the best in me and You always know what to do
'Cause even in my weakness, I still have You
Oh, You are the one who puts the light in, in the sun
And You're the one who drapes the stars in the sky when the sun is done
Yet in Your majesty, You still see the best in me and You always come through
'Cause even in my weakness, I still have
[Outro]
The King of Kings The Lord of Lords
The Great I Am, the Great I Am
My El Shaddai, my Jehovah Jireh
The Great Provider, yeah, the Great I Am
My awesome ruler, my great redeemer
God, You are everything I need, oh
'Cause even in my weakness, oh
I'm grateful that in my weakness, oh, thank You, Lord
That even in my weakness, I still have You
