I had a way with words for a while
You call it substance over style
Now I hear laugh but I don't see a smile
I had a way with words for a while
If I had've known I would've stuck around
'Cause what kinda man lets his brother down
Oh, while I was gone think about all that you found
A dear old friend and a brand new sound
I am one man
I can do anything
We are not far
We can do anything
Is the whole thing just a test?
Is there something you should get off your chest?
Don't keep me waiting on some SMS
Don't keep it all so close to the vest
I am one man
I can do anything
We are not far
We can do anything
Our return will come some day
The three of us will laugh and play
I know that we can find a way
Put it all behind us
Nothing to remind us
To put it all behind us
There'll be nothing to remind us
Won't hold my breath, won't wait in vain
Won't single you out, won't lay blame
I won't protest but I won't be the same
'Cause I'm the only one who has my name
I am one man
I can do anything
We are not far
We can do anything
One man
I can do anything
We are not far
We can do anything
Do anything
I am one man
