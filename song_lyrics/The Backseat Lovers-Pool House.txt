[Intro]
This song's called "Dugout"
"Pool House"
"Pool House"
Th-this song's called "Pool House"
One, two, three, four
[Verse 1]
Waiting around for something to change my mood
'Cause I know that what's in this plastic cup isn't going to
Kids on the lawn, stuck in pairs of two
Your lunch is on its way back up but you're still in the pool
[Chorus]
Wait inside
I'll be fine
I guess I'll sit outside
While you change your mind, oh no, woah-oh
[Verse 2]
I'll risk it all to find
A place where I can hear my thoughts
This song is playing too loud
But upstairs they're still making out
I'm getting all choked up
I guess it's just my luck
And I'm stuck on the porch
What am I waiting for
?
