[Verse 1]
I'm running 'round like a fish with my head cut off
I know, it don't make much sense to me either
The sun is shinin', I'm still broke as hell
But it's good to see the grass got greener
My mama called to say she's prayin' for me
And Jesus called but I wasn't there
He left a message on my answerin' machine
Just to tell me how much he cared
[Chorus]
And I don't want to think about tomorrow
What if tomorrow never comes?
Take me to a place without the sorrow
The story's gettin' old, where the good diе young
[Verse 2]
I've terrorized еverything in my eyes
And left 'em there to bleed
It's hard to hurt something that I love
When the only thing I love is me
So call the doctor, run for the hills
He's going insane, he's ran out of pills
He can't be saved, he's too far gone
Maybe I'm really alone[Chorus]
But I don't want to think about tomorrow
What if tomorrow never comes?
Take me to a place without the sorrow
The story's gettin' old, where the good die young
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
I don't want to think about tomorrow
What if tomorrow never comes?
Take me to a place without the sorrow
The story's gettin' old, where the good die young
[Outro]
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh woah
Where the good die young
