[Verse 1: Hezekiah Walker]
I was down to my last dime
But Jesus stepped in right on time
I sure been sick and I couldn't get well
When He healed my body and I can tell that it's
[Chorus]
Alright now
Think I'll make it
Anyhow
Alright now
Think I'll make it
Anyhow
[Verse 2: John P. Kee]
I was lost without a friend
Then I met Jesus and He took me in
In all of your temptation, He'll keep the faith
He already planned a way for you to escape
[Chorus]
Alright now
Think I'll make it
Anyhow
Alright now
Think I'll make it
Anyhow
[Verse 3: Both]
Through your trouble and through your pain, you better believe
(You can believe that it's alright)
Don't you stop shoutin', don't you stop praying, you better believe
(You can believe that it's alright)
[Chorus]
Alright now
Think I'll make it
Anyhow
Alright now
Think I'll make it
Anyhow
[Vamp]
I'll make it
I'll make it
I'll make it
[Chorus]
Alright now
Think I'll make it
Anyhow
