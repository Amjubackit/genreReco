[Intro]
I want to be stereotyped
I want to be classified
[Verse 1]
I wanna be stereotyped
I wanna be classified
[Chorus]
I wanna be a clone
I want a suburban home
Suburban home
Suburban home
Suburban home
[Verse 2]
I wanna be masochistic
I wanna be a statistic
[Chorus]
I wanna be a clone
I want a suburban home
Suburban home
Suburban home
Suburban home[Bridge]
I don't want no hippie pad
I want a house just like mom and dad
[Verse 3]
I wanna be stereotyped
I wanna be classified
I wanna be masochistic
I wanna be a statistic
[Chorus]
I wanna be a clone
I want a suburban home
Suburban home
Suburban home
Suburban home
Suburban home
Suburban home
[Outro]
I want to be stereotyped
I want to be classified
