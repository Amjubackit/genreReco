[Verse 1]
Let's take a moment and break the ice
So my intentions are known
See I have pity in watching you suffer
I know the feeling of being damned alone
I've got a storybook of my own
[Chorus]
Don't you see I am your pride, agent of wealth, bearer of needs
(And you know it's right)
I am your war, arming the strong, aiding the weak
Know me by name, Shepherd of Fire
[Verse 2]
Well I can promise you paradise
No need to serve on your knees
And when you're lost in the darkest of hours
Take a moment and tell me who you see
Won't tell you who not to be
[Chorus]
Now you know I am your pride, agent of wealth, bearer of needs
(And you know it's right)
I am your war, arming the strong, aiding the weak
Know me by name, Shepherd of Fire
