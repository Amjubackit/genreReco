[Intro: Big Freedia & 
Lauryn Hill
]
I wanna know who mothafuckin' representin' in here tonight
Hold on, hold on
I keep lettin' you back in
 (
You back in
)
How can I explain myself?
[Chorus: Lauryn Hill & 
Drake
]
Care for me, care for me, you said you'd care for me
There for me, there for me, said you'd be there for me
(Lil Weezyana shit)
Cry for me, cry for me, you said you'd die for me
(Murda on the beat)
Give to me, give to me, why won't you live for me?
Care for me, care for me, I know you care for me
(A song for y'all to cut up to, you know?)
There for me, there for me, said you'd be there for me 
(Yeah)
Cry for me, cry for me, you said you'd die for me
Give to me, give to me, why won't you live for me?
[Verse 1: Drake]
Everybody get your mothafuckin' roll on
I know shorty and she doesn't want no slow song
Had a man last year, life goes on
Haven't let that thing loose, girl, in so long
You've been inside, know you like to lay low
I've been peepin' what you bringin' to the table
Workin' hard, girl, everything paid for
First-last, phone bill, car note, cable
With your phone out, gotta hit them angles
With your phone out, snappin' like you Fabo
And you showin' off, but it's alright
And you showin' off, but it's alright (
Alright!
)
It's a short life, yeah
