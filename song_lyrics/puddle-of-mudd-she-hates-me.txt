[Verse 1]
Met a girl, thought she was grand
Fell in love, found out first hand
Went well for a week or two
Then it all came unglued
[Pre-Chorus]
In a trap, trip I can't grip
Never thought I'd be the one who'd slip
Then I started to realize
I was living one big lie
[Chorus]
She fucking hates me
Trust
She fucking hates me
La la la love
I tried too hard
And she tore my feelings like I had none
And ripped them away
[Verse 2]
She was queen for about an hour
After that, shit got sour
She took all I ever had
No sign of guilt
No feeling of bad, no
