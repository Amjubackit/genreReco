[Verse 1]
And now I cannot trust you
And I'm forced to let you go
That's what spreading thin on us do (Baby, you're the reason)
Hate to see you lose control
[Pre-Chorus]
Now I must spend all my time
Thinking of all your lies and cover ups
You're switching up on everyone who loves you (Baby, you're the reason)
But that doesn't stop the show and I think you should know that
[Chorus]
Baby, you're the reason
You always think the only one who needs any attention is you
Don't be so conceited
Hope you learned honesty was the only thing that could keep me from leaving
Baby, you're the reason
You always think the only one who needs any attention is you
Don't be so conceited
Hope you learned honesty was the only thing that could keep me from leaving
[Verse 2]
Now I'm left to wonder, how I let this go under
How I could watch it rain for so long and ain't hear no thunder
How we let all our Hollywood dreams end in a blunder
How I may never see you again, I hate when the summer ends
But it always would, and you'd always be disappointed
'Cause you're insecure, chasing things you thought you wanted
Like you thought you could
Just get further with frontin' and if Hollywood is home now
It's just a house that is haunted
[Pre-Chorus]
Where I'll spend all my time
Thinking of all your lies and cover ups
You're switching up on everyone who loves you (Baby, you're the reason)
But that doesn't stop my show
And I think you should know that
[Chorus]
Baby, you're the reason
You always think the only one who needs any attention is you
Don't be so conceited
Hope you learned honesty was the only thing that could keep me from leaving
Baby, you're the reason
You always think the only one who needs any attention is you
Don't be so conceited
Hope you learned honesty was the only thing that could keep me from leaving
