[Verse 1]
They beat us every damn year
It's been a minute since we pulled out a win
I loaded the truck down with beer
Drove down to watch ’em do it again
And they did so we went to the bar right after
Met a girl with a houndstooth print of her chapter on her shirt
And it turned into talkin' all night
She came back with me across the Vol' state line
[Chorus]
Guess the joke’s on Alabama
'Cause they lost big this time
I got the number one pick, blonde hair, red lips
Brought her over to the other side
A little deep south Delta Gamma
Done found a Smoky Mountain man
Yeah, she was raised Roll Tide 'til the day she died
But ever since that night, she's been a Tennessee fan
[Verse 2]
She likes ridin' on them windin' roads
The smell of sweet pine in the air
I took her about as high as you could go, huh
You can still see the Tuscaloosa from there
And all them girls back home say, "How could you love him?"
All them boys probably hate me for takin' her from 'em
Lord knows her mom and daddy’s jaw would drop
If they heard her singin’ every word of "Rocky Top"
[Chorus]
Guess the joke's on Alabama
’Cause they lost big this time
I got the number one pick, blonde hair, red lips
Brought her over to the other side
A little deep south Delta Gamma
Done found a Smoky Mountain man
Yeah, she was raised Roll Tide 'til the day she died
But ever since that night, she's been a Tennessee fan
[Bridge]
Oh
Yeah, it's alright, let’s just call it even
'Cause she's all mine and she ain't ever leavin'
And she's damn fine in orange every weekend from now on
Yeah, she found home
[Chorus]
Looks like the joke's on Alabama
'Cause they lost big this time
I got the number one pick, blonde hair, red lips
Brought her over to the other side
A little deep south Delta Gamma
Done found a Smoky Mountain man
Yeah, she was raised Roll Tide 'til the day she died
But ever since that night, she's been a Tennessee fan
Oh, she's been a Tennessee fan
