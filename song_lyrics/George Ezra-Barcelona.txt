[Verse 1]
Barcelona
I still long to hold her once more, oh
My boots of leather
From Europe
I gather you know, know
[Chorus]
Every time you have to go
Shut my eyes and you know
I'll be lying right by your side
In Barcelona
[Verse 2]
A native man sang in a foreign tongue
I still ache to know the song that he sung
Barcelona
[Chorus]
Every time you have to go
Shut my eyes and you know
I'll be lying right by your side
In Barcelona
Every time you have to go
Shut my eyes and you know
I'll be lying right by your side
In Barcelona
