[Chorus]
Lately I'm drowning my pain with a bottle and Mary Jane
No matter what I take, I feel the same
I been bound by these shackles and chains
A man of convictions, damn these addictions
Just can't be tamed
So lately I'm drowning my pain with a bottle and Mary Jane
[Verse 1]
Coming down a back road, a cloud of fat smoke rolling out my window
Even though I'm damaged, I'm standing on all ten toes
I'm lost when I should go from here, I don't know
Eyes gloss but the pain on my face I won't show
A prisoner inside my mind, I can't get out of here
I don't know why I ignore signs when they're so loud and clear
[Chorus]
Lately I'm drowning my pain with a bottle and Mary Jane
No matter what I take, I feel the same
I been bound by these shackles and chains
A man of convictions, damn these addictions
Just can't be tamed
So lately I'm drowning my pain with a bottle and Mary Jane
[Verse 2]
No one else to turn to so I burn through another bag of pine
Courage is a virtue, it refers to this life of mine
I could drink a fifth of liquor and feel like I'm fine
I know even then, I'd never be satisfied
I cannot pay the bills, pop a couple pills, and just get by
Wouldn't change the pain I feel
Seeing tears spill out my daughter's eyes
So I pop the top on this bottle and pour it on ice
When I'm wrong is the only time I feel right
