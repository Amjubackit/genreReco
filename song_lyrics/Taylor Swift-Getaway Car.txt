[Intro]
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car
[Verse 1]
It was the best of times, the worst of crimes
I struck a match and blew your mind
But I didn't mean it and you didn’t see it
The ties were black, the lies were white
In shades of gray in candlelight
I wanted to leave him, I needed a reason
[Pre-Chorus]
"X" marks the spot where we fell apart
He poisoned the well, I was lyin' to myself
I knew it from the first Old Fashioned, we were cursed
We never had a shotgun shot in the dark (Oh!)
[Chorus]
You were drivin' the getaway car
We were flyin’, but we'd never get far
Don't pretend it's such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
Ridin' in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart
Should've known I'd be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me
In a getaway car, oh-oh-oh
No, they never get far, oh-oh-ah
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car
