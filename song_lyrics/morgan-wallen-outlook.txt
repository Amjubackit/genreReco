[Verse 1]
I used to think that it was me against the world, but it wasn't
Thought drinkin' from a glass half empty made it better, but it doesn't
Funny all the things you realize
When that 20/20 hindsight vision opens up your eyes
[Chorus]
Now my outlook on life is different than it used to be
Yeah, my outlook is someone's up there
Lookin' down and lookin' out for me
[Verse 2]
Something in my ramblin' soul said I had to go toe to toe with the devil
Fell in love with a gypsy girl, said she couldn't risk it on a rebel
At least not one that doesn't have a cause
And I'll admit, I guess back thеn that's all I really was
[Chorus]
Now my outlook on life is differеnt than it used to be
Yeah, my outlook is someone's up there
Lookin' down and lookin' out for me
[Instrumental Break]
[Bridge]
There's so many crossroads you come to
And you can't put your finger on
Why you went the way you did, and then
[Verse 3]
You look up and here you are on the flip side of crazy
It's something more than lucky stars you thank when you kiss your baby
Always believed in God and angels in the sky
But never thought that I deserved an angel by my side
[Chorus]
Now my outlook on life is different than it used to be
Yeah, my outlook is someone's up there
Lookin' down and lookin' out for me
Now my outlook on life is different than it used to be
Yeah, my outlook is someone's up there
Lookin' down and lookin' out for me
[Outro]
Yeah, lookin' down, lookin' out for me
