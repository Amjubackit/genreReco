[Verse 1]
Looking at the city like I already own it
Standing on top 'cause I earned this moment
I took what was mine, now I won't let go of it
'Cause I'm a hustler, yeah I'm a hustler
'Cause I'm a hustler, yeah I'm a hustler
[Pre-Chorus]
I didn't come from luxe or own no diamonds
Yeah I was barely getting by, we survive like lions
But now I'm a king, now I'm a titan
'Cause I'm a hustler, yeah I'm a hustler
'Cause I'm a hustler, yeah I'm a hustler
[Chorus]
Keep turning up the heat
I keep turning up the heat
Keep turning up the heat
Yeah, yeah, I'm a hustler
Yeah, yeah
Keep turning up the heat (keep turning it up)
I know the price is steep (keep turning it up)
They gonna call me king
Yeah, yeah, I'm a hustler
Yeah, yeah, I'm a hustler[Verse 2]
I ain't afraid of the pressure when it comes on stronger
'Cause I'm always pushing through you, always going harder
When everyone is through, Iâ€™ll be here longer
'Cause I'm a hustler, yeah I'm a hustler
'Cause I'm a hustler, yeah I'm a hustler
[Chorus]
Keep turning up the heat
I keep turning up the heat
Keep turning up the heat
Yeah, yeah, I'm a hustler
Yeah, yeah
Keep turning up the heat (keep turning it up)
I know the price is steep (keep turning it up)
They gonna call me king
Yeah, yeah, I'm a hustler
I'm a hustler
[Bridge]
I keep on looking up, looking up
When things be gettin' down, gettin' down
I keep on looking up, looking up
When things be gettin' down, gettin' down
[Refrain]
'Cause I'm a hustler, yeah I'm a hustler
'Cause I'm a hustler, yeah I'm a hustler[Chorus]
Keep turning up the heat (keep turning it up)
I keep turning up the heat (keep turning it up)
Keep turning up the heat
Yeah, yeah, I'm a hustler
Yeah, yeah
Keep turning up the heat (keep turning it up)
I know the price is steep (keep turning it up)
They gonna call me king
Yeah, yeah, I'm a hustler
Yeah, yeah, I'm a hustler
