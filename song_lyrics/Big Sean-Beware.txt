[Chorus: Big Sean & Jhené Aiko]
When you said it was over, you shot right through my heart
Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart?
Ooh, I was so mad, I should've seen this coming right from the start
You should beware, beware, beware of a woman with a broken heart
[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Yeah, praying to a sky all black
Looking at the stars like they finna talk back
Looking at my phone like she finna call back
But last night I feel like probably ended all that
'Cause by now, she woulda sent a text in all caps
Then another one tryna take it all back
Saying "Fuck you," "I miss you," or "I hate you so much"
'Cause girls only say "hate you" to the guys that they love
I know, I know, I know
The highs, the lows it comes, it goes
You say "Be real," I try, I don't
'Cause you take anything and just make it everything (God)
Kept my phone on silent ever since you got a ring, funny, right?
And I never cheated; I mean, maybe once or twice
But one time don't change everything
She ask why I don't feel the same, I'm still the same
She's still insane and now she's saying
[Chorus: Big Sean & Jhené Aiko]
When you said it was over, you shot right through my heart
Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart?
Ooh, I was so mad, I should've seen this coming right from the start
You should beware, beware, beware of a woman with a broken heart
