[Verse 1]
You wanted a hit
But maybe we don't do hits
I try and try
It ends up feeling kind of wrong
You wanted it tough
But is it ever tough enough?
No, nothing's ever tough enough
Until we hit the road
[Verse 2]
Yeah, you wanted it lush
But honestly, you must hush
No, honestly, you know too much
So leave us, leave us on our own
And so you wanted a hit
Well this is how we do hits
You wanted a hit
But that's not what we do
[Verse 3]
You wanted it real
But can you tell me what's real?
There's lights and sounds and stories
Music's just a part
