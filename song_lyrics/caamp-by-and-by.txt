[Verse 1]
Driving through West Virginia
And I’ve seldom been thinner
With that chip on my shoulder
And this past year I got so much older
[Verse 2]
Lookin’ back over my life
Spent the most of it tongue tied
I wish I’d had more time
Listenin’ to you speak your mind
[Chorus]
Now I’m thinkin’ about her everyday
On my mind, atypical way
Are you a life force?
Thinkin’ about her everyday
On my mind, atypical way
Are you a life force?
[Banjo Interlude]
[Verse 3]
Drinkin’ coffee black as iron
And I couldn’t be much higher
Without fallin’ out of my chair
Been so numb for so many years
[Chorus]
Now I’m thinkin’ about her everyday
On my mind, atypical way
Are you a life force?
Thinking about her everyday
On my mind, atypical way
Are you a life force?
[Bridge]
And it's so easy
To be blinded by the light
To feel lonely in the night
This blowing in the breeze babe
I got dust in my eyes
And rust in my mind
I'll be home come next spring
Won't you say you love me later, by and by
[Verse 4]
Looking back over life
Spent the most of it tongue tied
Pullin’ my belt tight
Just me and the stars tonight
[Verse 5]
Two fingers and a tight line
Keep my head above the alpine
Just wish I'd spent more time
Listenin’ to her speak her mind
[Chorus]
Thinking about her everyday
On my mind atypical way
Are you a life force?
Thinking about her everyday
On my mind atypical way
Are you a life force?
Thinking about her everyday
On my mind atypical way
Are you a life force?
Thinking about her everyday
On my mind atypical way
Are you a life force
For me?
