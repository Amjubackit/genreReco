[Verse 1]
Driving through West Virginia
And I’ve seldom been thinner
With that chip on my shoulder
And this past year I got so much older
[Verse 2]
Lookin’ back over my life
Spent the most of it tongue tied
I wish I’d had more time
Listenin’ to you speak your mind
[Chorus]
Now I’m thinkin’ about her everyday
On my mind, atypical way
Are you a life force?
Thinkin’ about her everyday
On my mind, atypical way
Are you a life force?
[Banjo Interlude]
[Verse 3]
Drinkin’ coffee black as iron
And I couldn’t be much higher
Without fallin’ out of my chair
Been so numb for so many years
