It's up to you
What you do with your life
You have just one
So do what's right now
Somebody Ask Me
Every woman
And every man
Save yourself
And a friend if you can
Somebody Ask Me
No one knows
How long it will be
Just be ready
So you can be free
Somebody Ask Me
Biggest problem
Of the world today
People just don't believe
That he's comin' back one day
Somebody Ask Me
Soul I can feel (Oh Lord)
Somebody Ask Me
