[Intro: Daft Punk]
Work it, make it, do it, makes us
Harder, better, faster, stronger
[Chorus: Kanye West & 
Daft Punk
]
N-Now th-that that don't kill me
Can only make me stronger
I need you to hurry up now
'Cause I can't wait much longer
I know I got to be right now
'Cause I can't get much wronger
Man, I've been waiting all night now
That's how long I been on ya
(
Work it harder, make it better
Do it faster, makes us stronger
)
(I need you right now!)
(
More than ever, hour after hour
Work–
)
(I need you right now!)
[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Let's get lost tonight
You could be my black Kate Moss tonight
Play secretary, I'm the boss tonight
And you don't give a fuck what they all say, right?
Awesome, the Christian in Christian Dior
Damn, they don't make 'em like this anymore
I ask, 'cause I'm not sure
Do anybody make real shit anymore?
Bow in the presence of greatness
'Cause right now, thou hast forsaken us
You should be honored by my lateness
That I would even show up to this fake shit
So go ahead, go nuts, go apeshit!
'Specially in my Pastellé, on my Bape shit
Act like you can't tell who made this
New Gospel, homie, take six
And take this, haters!
