[Verse 1]
It's the same each and every night (Hello)
Glare at my screen with two big bloodshot eyes
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm stuck self-torturing
My meds are failing me
Internal clock in smithereens
Can't fix this, I'm hopeless
[Chorus 1]
My eyes are stapled open wide
As I lay down on my side
I am bouncing off these walls
[Verse 2]
Notice my hands begin to twitch
Unprovoked assaulting of my conscious wit
Me and the TV are enemies
Sickening static surrounds my mind
I'm losing time, and realizing that
After days of thought that I'm
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm stuck self-torturing
My meds are failing me
Internal clock in smithereens
Can't fix this, I'm hopeless
[Chorus]
My eyes are stapled open wide
As I lay down on my side
I am bouncing off these walls
As I focus on the clock
Time stands still, but I cannot
I should strap myself in bed
I guess I'll sleep when I am dead
[Bridge]
Talk to myself, lie in the darkness so content
As the sun begins to rise, I can barely shut my eyes
This crazed, delirious mess; laughing at everything I see
My sanity is spent, just tell me where my time went
I'm losing it
[Spoken]
Attention: All insomniacs, please raise your right hand
And kindly, repeat after me:
"I guess I'll sleep when I am dead!"
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm stuck self-torturing
My meds are failing me
Internal clock in smithereens
Can't fix this, I'm hopeless
[Chorus]
My eyes are stapled open wide
As I lay down on my side
I am bouncing off these walls
As I focus on the clock
Time stands still, but I cannot
I should strap myself in bed
I guess I'll sleep when I am dead
No, no, no
I guess I'll sleep when I am
