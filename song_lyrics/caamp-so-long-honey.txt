[Verse 1]
We sit with the fools and the sinners
The jokers and the killers
It’s just our way
Toss a rock and you break a window
And toss a feather up
And watch the wind blow
It away
[Chorus]
And you can float on the wind for so long
But someday, honey
You’ve got to come back down
And when you do, I'll be hanging around
[Verse 2]
It smells like smoke in here
And the piano does not play
It never did
And there’s this feeling I get
When you’re in the room
I want you to stay
[Chorus]
And you can float on the wind for so long
But someday, honey
You have to come back down
And when you do, I'll be hanging around
And you can float on the wind for so long
But someday, honey, you’ve have to come back down
And when you do, I'll be hanging around[Guitar Instrumental]
[Bridge]
Be good to your mothers
Oh, they did the best they could
And bleed for your brothers
'Cause Lord knows that they would
And be good to your mothers
Oh, they did the best they could
(Ooh, ooh)
And you better bleed for your brothers
'Cause Lord knows that they would
[Outro]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
