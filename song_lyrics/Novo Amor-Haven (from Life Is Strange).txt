[Verse 1]
I'll be late, but I could make it all up to you
I'll count down the days, don’t say that you wouldn’t too
'Cause I heard the rain, as I felt you coming loose
And I heard my name, it broke my head in two
[Verse 2]
I'll celebrate on the day that I get the news
I'll count down the ways, I'll be wishing that I was you
But I can't correlate the way you move
So I'll stay half away, and I'll guess that it'll do
