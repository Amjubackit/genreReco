[Chorus]
I won't wait for you
If all you want is my money
Gotta get away from you
If all you want is my money (If all you)
[Verse]
Sit back and ride a wave, a tidal wave (Yeah)
Relax, don't fight the wave, light the way
Oh, you want a piece of it all?
Look, fuck 'em, I gotta get the money too
I got three to protect, I need a money tree
Like, what you need the money for?
If you got a reason, you need a couple more, 'cause
I can't wait around for you no more
[Chorus]
I won't wait for you
If all you want is my money
Gotta get away from you
If all you want is my money (If all you)
[Bridge]
No
Now, I can't wait for you, no
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh, woah-oh
Woah-ooh, woo, ooh[Instrumental Break]
[Outro]
If all you want is my money
