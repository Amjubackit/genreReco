[Chorus]
'Cause I'm useless when you're stuck in my mind
I've been foolish, think of you all the time
Play some music like a harp in the sky
I'ma lose it if you're not by my side
[Verse 1]
I've been watchin' you and I've been tryna decide
If I could ever remind you of what you really liked
And I know it's not possible, but I wish you would try
'Cause it keeps on playing back in my head a million times
[Chorus]
'Cause I'm useless (Oh) when you're stuck in my mind
I've been foolish (Oh), think of you all the time
Play some music (Oh) like a harp in the sky
I'ma lose it (Oh) if you're not by my side (Side, yeah)
[Verse 2]
I've been losin' sleep and I've been thinking 'bout why
You used to tell me that I'm all that you need in your life
And you said I was your soulmate, but that was just a lie (Ooh)
It's alright, we're way too young to be givin' out advice
[Chorus]
'Cause I'm useless (Oh) when you're stuck in my mind
I've been foolish (Oh), think of you all the time
Play some music (Oh) like a harp in the sky
I'ma lose it (Oh) if you're not by my side (Side, yeah)[Outro]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
