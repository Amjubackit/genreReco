[Verse 1]
I've been lost before and I’m lost again, I guess
But I never lost this feeling or this pounding in my chest
I have travelled many miles, I don't wanna to walk no more
Every road and every highway led me right back to your door
[Chorus]
Love me like you used to 
and I'll praise you like I should
Love me if you choose to, though you say that I’m no good
I dream most every night that I never left you
[Verse 2]
Do you love me anymore? Does my memory remain?
Lord, I know I made mistakes, but I am different now, I'vе changed
When I open up your door, will you know mе from the rest?
Will you let me lay beside you? Will you grant me my request?
[Chorus]
Love me like you used to and I'll praise you like I should
Love me if you choose to, though you say that I'm no good
[Bridge]
I swear this time around I'm gonna stay
When I dream, I'll only dream of you
I curse the goddamn day that I went and left you[Chorus]
Love me like you used to and I'll praise you like I should
Love me if you choose to, though you say that I'm no good
Love me like you used to and I’ll praise you like I should
I don’t wanna to lose you, I would change it if I could
I can't erase the day that I went and left you
