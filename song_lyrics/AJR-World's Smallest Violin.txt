[Verse 1]
My grandpa fought in World War II
He was such a noble dude
I can't even finish school
Missed my mom and left too soon
His dad was a fireman
Who fought fires so violent
I think I bored my therapist
While playing him my violin
[Pre-Chorus]
(Oh my god) That's so insane
(Oh my god) That's such a shame
Next to them, my shit don't feel so grand
But I can't help myself from feeling bad
I kinda feel like two things can be sad (One, two, three, four)
[Chorus]
The world's smallest violin
Really needs an audience
So if I do not find somebody soon (That's right, that's right)
I'll blow up into smithereens
And spew my tiny symphony
Just let me play my violin for you, you, you, you
[Instrumental Break]
