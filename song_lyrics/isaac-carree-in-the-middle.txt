[Intro]
Hello
Am I on?
Okay go
Ladies and gentlemen thank you for coming tonight
I got a young man I'd like to introduce you to
We call him "Ike Nice" (Ike Nice)
[Verse 1]
Tears rolling down your face
And your heart feelin' like it's gon' break
And your earth feels like it's 'bout to shake
And you've taken all that you can take
Just remember where your help comes from
Realizing you got somewhere to run
Don't worry 'bout what you're going through
Instead of worrying, here's what you can do
[Chorus]
Praise him anyway
In the middle of it
In the middle of it
In the middle of it
You should praise him anyway
In the middle of it
In the middle of it
In the middle of it
[Verse 2]
Listen
I'm just like you
If you cut me I'm 'gon bleed
I got wants just as well as I got needs
I've been hungry and not had no food to eat
And been knocked down as soon as I got on my feet
Lord it was You that helped me understand
And it was You that never let go of my hand
I promise that I'll always give you praise
No matter what this world brings my way
[Chorus]
I'll praise you anyway
In the middle of it (Oh yeah)
In the middle of it
In the middle of it
I'm gonna lift my hands
In the middle of it
In the middle of it
In the middle of it
I'm gonna do my dance (Right there)
In the middle of it
In the middle of it
In the middle of it
I'm gonna shout for joy
In the middle of it
In the middle of it
In the middle of it
[Post-Chorus]
Now clap your hands now
Oooh, you've got that right
And do your dance now
Right in the middle of it
You oughta praise Him anyway
Whatever your situation is
Put Him in the middle of it
No matter what you're going through
The battle is not yours, it's the Lord's
[Bridge]
If you're sick you should praise
If you're hurt
If you're broke
If you're down you should praise
Whatever you're going through
Just praise
He knows what you're going through
Praise
Praise
Comm'on clap your hands
Right there
Right there
[Outro]
Comm'on and do  your dance
Believe it or not
God in Heaven's throne is waiting for all this people
Ooooh ye, oohohoh yee
Clap your hands now
