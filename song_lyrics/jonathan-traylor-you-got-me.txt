[Verse 1]
When my mind is under attack, be my peace
And when my life seems a little off track, shepherd me
You know every twist and turn that this life brings
When my heart beats a little too fast, calm my sea, shh
[Chorus]
You got me
You got me
I know, I know, I know
I know You got me
You got me
Yes, You do
I know You got me
[Verse 2]
When doing the right thing is hard to do, strengthen me
And when I feel I have something to prove, affirm me
You know every secret war that I'm fighting
And when my heart is under attack, rеmind me (Please, rеmind me)
[Chorus]
You got me, oh
You got me
I know, I know, I know
I know You got me
You got me
[Bridge]
You're the only one that knows me in and out
And there's never been a day you've let me down
And when fear tries to convince otherwise
You remind me that You've never left my side
[Chorus]
Yeah, You got me
You got me, You got me
You got me
I know you got me
You never let me go
You never let me go
You got me, You got me, You got me
I know you got me
