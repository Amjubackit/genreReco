[Verse 1]
I don't wanna fight
My money's in a bag in the back for you
The future's overdue
Yeah, I know that
Turn the engine on
Our song blaring out a 
dead radio
Singing "
I Need To Know
"
No turning back
[Chorus]
I've been thinkin', babe, maybe you're right
When you said the pain weathers in time
We're just waitin' for a change to follow
We don't always get all that we want
Redefine the pain to something more
And we shall overcome as we've done before
[Verse 2]
Scrolling through a life
I barely rеcognised from a hotel room
Took in the lonеly view
Got unattached (Hey)
Bringer of the calm
Your arms wrapped around when the fever took
Thought I was gone for good
You brought me back[Chorus]
I've been thinkin', babe, maybe you're right
When you said the pain weathers in time
We're just waitin' for a change to follow
We don't always get all that we want
Redefine the pain to something more
And we shall overcome as we've done before (Oh)
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge]
It's when we lean in, into the moment
It's when we're reachin' through the divide
It's when we begin feelin' the open
It's when the stranger's fallen behind
When we shake off the darkness and harness the light
[Chorus]
I've been thinkin', babe, maybe you're right
When you said the pain weathers in time
We're just waitin' for a change to follow
We don't always get all that we want
Redefine the pain to something more
And we shall overcome as we've done before
And we shall overcome as we've done before
And we shall overcome as we've done before
