[Verse 1]
We walk the streets at night, 
we go where eagles dare
They pick up every movement, they pick up every loser
With jaded eyes and features, you think they really care
[Chorus]
I ain't no goddamn son of a bitch
You better think about it, baby
I ain't no goddamn son of a bitch
You better think about it, baby, babe
[Verse 2]
An omelet of disease awaits your noontime meal
Her mouth of germicide seducing all your glands
[Chorus]
I ain't no goddamn son of a bitch
You better think about it, baby
I ain't no goddamn son of a bitch
You better think about it, baby, babe
[Verse 3]
Let's test your threshold of pain, let's see how long you last
That tie pin in your retina unbosoms all your past
With jaded eyes and features, you think they really care
Let's go where eagles dare, we'll go where eagles dare[Chorus]
I ain't no goddamn son of a bitch
You better think about it, baby
I ain't no goddamn son of a bitch
You better think about it, baby
I ain't no goddamn son of a bitch
You better think about it, baby
I ain't no goddamn son of a bitch
You better think about it, baby, ba- ba- ba-
