[Intro]
Loud thunder heavy rain
Thin line between joy and pain
It's a long strange trip it's all insane
You ain't never gonna be the same
Living life through the night
Thin line of a lightning strike
Sometimes the only light
When the moon is tucked away
[Verse 1]
Pistons pumping
Minds are racing
It's hard to sleep man
When I'm shaking
Bad news surrounds me
Its always found me
Creeping up when things are good
Yeah the dark days find a way
[Chorus]
Loud thunder heavy rain
Thin line between joy and pain
It's a long strange trip it's all insane
You ain't never gonna be the same
Living life through the night
Thin line of a lightning strike
Sometimes the only light
When the moon is tucked away
