[Intro: Nicki Minaj]
Queen
[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj & 
Lumidee
]
Only on them C's if it's breeze,
 
Red Ruby Da Sleeze
  (
Uh-oh, uh-oh
)
Chinese on my sleeve
, 
these wannabe Chun-Lis
Anyway, 你好 (你好, 
uh-oh
)
Who the fuck told bitches they was me now? (
Uh-oh
, ooh)
I knew these bitches was slow, I ain't know these bitches senile (Ooh)
Married a shooter case you niggas tried to breathe loud (Brr-brr)
Boom your face off, then I tell him, "Cease fire"
I'm the A, B side
Seven-hundred on them horses when we fixin' to leave (
Uh-oh
)
But I don't fuck with horses since Christopher Reeves (
Uh-oh
)
(
Uh-oh, uh-oh
)
Gotta be careful when I dip, it's flips all in the whip
It's 40s with 30 clips, FN's with the switch
Guacamole with the taco, waitin' on El Chapo
Came in the Rolls and left low in a Tahoe
[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Bad gyal don't die-die-die (Brr)
Hundred rounds on that grrah-ta-ta
Real one lick a shot-ta-ta
She my lil' vibe, my lil' ah-ah-ah
Bad gyal don't run from nobody, like ah
Rude boy want me touchin' on his body, like yah
Boy affi dead if he ever diss me
And he know what to do if he ever miss me
