[Intro: Alicia Keys]
Yeah
It's crazy
It's crazy
Come on, come on yeah
I wanna tell you really
Oh yeah, all I know yeah
Hey
I wanna know yeah
[Verse 1: Alicia Keys]
Hey baby, how you doin' tonight?
I wanna let you know
I wanna tell you just how I feel
I wanna love you, baby
And it's going so right
I wanna burn a candle
Turn the darkness to light
[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
With the fire we make
It's getting hotter and hotter
Like a moth to a flame
I can't stay away
From the fire we make
It's getting higher and higher
Like the night to the day
I can't stay, I can't stay away
No, no, no, no
Stay away
