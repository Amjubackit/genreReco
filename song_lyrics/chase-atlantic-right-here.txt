[Verse 1: Mitchel Cave]
I'm so far from the line, yeah
I'm too deep in my mind, yeah
If she calls, I'll be right there
That's three calls in a night, yeah
[Pre-Chorus: Mitchel Cave]
Well tell me what you think about
Staying right here instead?
I didn't hear a word she said
I wasn't that high, I swear
Well girl, what do you think about
Staying right here in bed?
I didn't hear a word you said
I wasn't that high, I swear it
[Chorus: Mitchel Cave]
It's happenin' again
Well, 
I don't give a fuck about your friends
I'm right here, here
Oh, baby, take a look around
I'm the only one that hasn't walked out
I'm right here, here
(I'm right here, here)
[Verse 2: Christian Anthony]
One draw at a time, yeah
One more, you'll be fine, yeah
And I swore she was right there
The blue glow and the nightwear[Pre-Chorus: Christian Anthony]
Tell me what you think about
Staying right here instead?
I didn't hear a word she said
Wasn't that high, I swear it
She don't wanna fuck around
And I don't wanna leave this bed
I didn't hear a word she said
Wasn't that high, I swear
[Chorus: Mitchel Cave]
It's happenin' again
Well, I don't give a fuck about your friends
I'm right here, here
Oh, baby, take a look around
I'm the only one that hasn't walked out
I'm right here, here
[Bridge: Mitchel Cave]
I'm always ready to go
I'm calling you, pick up your phone
I'm on my own
Girl, I'll be takin' it slow
You know, I'll be takin' it slow
(You're sitting alone, why are you sitting alone?
Baby just pick up your phone, oh)
'Cause I've been rollin' all day and night, whoa[Chorus: Mitchel Cave]
It's happenin' again
Well I don't give a fuck about your friends
I'm right here, here
Oh, baby, take a look around
I'm the only one that hasn't walked out
I'm right here, here
[Solo]
(I'm right here, here)
(I'm right here, here)
