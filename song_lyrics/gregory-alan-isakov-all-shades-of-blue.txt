[Verse 1]
When the 
wine stops working
 and you're all run out
And all of your high hopes have all headed south
And the 
songs left the stable
 and they never came home
And there ain't no forgetting that you're out on your own
[Verse 2]
Turned the scrub oaks to timber
 and you're left without friends
And you don't put your book down even after it ends
Smoke curls up from the table in your quiet little room
And your heart's worn the handle of an old pushing broom
[Chorus]
Broken bottles shine just like stars
Make a wish anyway
Just your smile lit a 
sixty-watt bulb
 in my house
That was darkened for days
Been thinking you probably should stay
[Verse 3]
When the going is long gone and the kick drum won't kick
When you fumble with your fiddle, are you fresh out of tricks?
And the horseflies are biting but the fish never do
And your heart's a thousand colors but they're all shades of blue
[Chorus]
Broken bottles shine just like stars
Make a wish anyway
Just your smile lit a sixty-watt bulb in my house
That was darkened for days
I been thinking you probably should stay
Yeah, I think that you probably should stay[Outro]
And our dreams on the windowsill
See those 
trees turning gold in the hills
