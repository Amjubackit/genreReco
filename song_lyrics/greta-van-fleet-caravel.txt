[Verse 1]
Crash against wave upon wave, woah
To strange horizons, ooh
Heel to the mist and the wind, yeah
You wake the movement, ooh
[Chorus]
Woah, as you can tell
This was the age of the caravel
Woah, as you can tell
These are the times you'll remember well
[Verse 2]
Sail to the end of the world, woah
For death or glory, ooh
Bow with your face to the sky, yeah
We are the movement, ooh
[Instrumental]
[Chorus]
Woah, as you can tell
This was the age of the caravel
Woah, as you can tell
These are the times youâ€™ll remember well
[Instrumental]
Woah
