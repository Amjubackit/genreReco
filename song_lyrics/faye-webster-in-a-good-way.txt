[Verse 1]
I didn't know that I was capable of being happy right now
But you showed me how
I didn't know that you were right in front of me
Until I looked out
[Chorus]
You make me wanna cry in a good way
You make me wanna cry in a good way
You make me wanna cry in a good way
You make me wanna cry in a good way
[Verse 2]
You weigh just as much as me, don't you (ah)
I can feel it when we touch
I know you've been having nightmares lately
And I'm sorry I fall asleep first
[Chorus]
You make me wanna cry in a good way
You make me wanna cry in a good way
You make me wanna cry in a good way
You make me wanna cry in a good way
[Verse 3]
I didn't know that I was capable of being happy right now
But you showed me how
I didn't know that you were right in front of me
Until I looked out
