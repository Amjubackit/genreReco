[Verse 1]
I don't wanna call and talk too long
I know it was wrong, but never said I was sorry
Now I've had time to think it over
We're much older and the bone's too big to bury
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, isn't it a shame that it ended like that?
Said goodbye forever, but you never unpacked
We went to Hell, but we never came back
[Chorus]
I'm sorry that you're jaded
I could've taken you places
You're lonely now and I hate it
I'm sorry that you're jaded
[Verse 2]
You're not even willin' to look at your part
You just jump in the car and head down to thе bar 'til you're blurry
Don't know when to stop, so you take it too far
I don't know whеre you are and I'm left in the dark 'til I'm worried
Ooh, and it hurts me
[Pre-Chorus]
And it's a fuckin' shame that it ended like that
You broke your own heart, but you'd never say that
We went to Hell, but we never came back
