[Verse 1]
Help me Holy Ghost
I need You more than anything
All my best ideas are Yours
What am I but what You make of me
[Chorus]
So help me God
Breathe on my weakness
For all I want is to be like Jesus
I don’t have much
But what I have is Yours to use
So make my whole life Your upper room
[Verse 2]
Help me Holy Ghost
I need You more than I can say
May Your thoughts become my own
Till the Father’s will be done in me
[Chorus]
So help me God
Breathe on my weakness
For all I want is to be like Jesus
I don’t have much
But what I have is Yours to use
So make my whole life Your upper room[Instrumental]
[Chorus]
So help me God
Breathe on my weakness
For all I want is to be like Jesus
I don’t have much
But what I have is Yours to use
So make my whole life Your upper room
[Instrumental]
