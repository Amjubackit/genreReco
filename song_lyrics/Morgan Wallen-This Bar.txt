[Chorus]
I found myself in this bar
Makin' mistakes and makin’ new friends
I was growin' up and nothing made sense
Buzzin' all night like neon in the dark
I found myself in this
[Verse 1]
Couldn’t wait to turn 21
The day I did, I got too drunk
Spin around dizzy on the patio
Found out real quick how to take it slow
Got whiskey bent on whiskey sours
Ran my mouth to an out-of-towner
Learned a big lesson when I met the bouncer
[Chorus]
I found myself in this bar
Makin' mistakes and makin' new friends
I was growin' up and nothing made sense
Buzzin' all night like neon in the dark
I found myself in this bar
[Post Chorus]
Ooh-woah-ooh
Ooh-woah-ooh
Ooh-woah-ooh
I found myself in this bar
