[Verse 1]
Meet me when the sun goes down
Ring ring once you get downtown
In so deep, baby can't fix this
Like a user, baby I'm addicted to it
You get in my backseat
See you gettin naked in the rearview
Oh, I'm up here trippin' off you
Glance at the thought I want you
Blood is on my hands, but that never stopped me before, baby
Yeah, you know it's alright with me, with me, yeah
[Hook]
And I hit it, like it's all mine
Should've paid that, woman, more mind
Tell me, did you get the news?
She ain't fuckin' with you no more
And I hit it, like it's all mine
Should've paid that, woman, more mind
Tell me, did you get the news?
She ain't fuckin' with you no more
[Verse 2]
All, it's all mine, it's all mine
I gotta live by this, can't trust what these women do
He shoulda' never trusted you
You had me touchin' on your body
Tellin' me you belong to nobody
I know, everybody's playin' games
They all caught up in the blame, I know baby
So when you come around looking like this
Don't think I don't recognize that shit
But every now and then I see a woman that gets me higher
Put it all on me like that
So weak when you move like that
