[Verse 1: Leon Bridges]
You're speaking a language no one speaks
In a room that don't exist
I'm just gonna shut up
And bear witness
You are everything
[Chorus: Leon Bridges]
Wanna feel you all around
Baby, let your summer rain
Keep coming down
Don't stop now
Don't stop now, now, now
[Verse 2: Jazmine Sullivan, 
Jazmine Sullivan & Leon Bridges
]
Forty days and forty nights
Wrapped in covers drenched in white
And it's getting warmer like a sauna
I don't wanna make it out alive
'Cause you, 
you are everything
[Chorus: Jazmine Sullivan & Leon Bridges, 
Leon Bridges
, 
Jazmine Sullivan
]
Wanna feel you all around
Baby, let your summer rain
Keep coming down, down, down
Baby, let your summer rain
Keep coming down
Baby, let your summer rain
Keep coming down
Don't stop now
Don't stop now
 (
Now
), 
now
 (
Now
), 
now
Keep it coming down
Don't stop now
Wanna feel you on me
Don't stop now, now, now
 (
Don't stop, don't stop please
)
