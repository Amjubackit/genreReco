[Verse 1]
If you could only feel the way that I feel
Ready for the war to come my way
Yeah, I struggled so I know what it takes
The pressure only builds 'til it breaks
If you could only feel the way that I feel
[Pre-Chorus]
You may think it's something spiritual
[Chorus]
But I'm betting on the right here, right now
To hell with all the someday, somehow
I've waited long enough
Waited long enough
(Don't need a miracle!)
Right here, right now
To hell with all the someday, somehow
I've waited long enough
Waited long enough
(Don't need a miracle!)
[Post-Chorus]
You might think it's something spiritual
But I don't need a fucking miracle, ay!
