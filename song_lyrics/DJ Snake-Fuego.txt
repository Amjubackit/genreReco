[Intro: Anitta]
Don't make me crazy
Your  bed won't take it
Don't  start that fuego
I can't fight my DNA
Loca (Ahh)
[Verse 1: Sean Paul]
Alright  then
Just  one touch weh mi gi di likkle miss
And she start fi go loopy
Mi  tell her me loving
Don't miss on the ride back home
Taking her home
Like she feel man a joke
She  fall inna love wid di way how I do it
And I must love the way how she just can't leave me alone
Crazy because she a pick up the phone
She nuh stop call Simone
And a tell her she moan and groan in the zone
Think me a clown then mi give her the bone
Now she have to turn around, give me the crown
You see?
