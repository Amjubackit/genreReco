Sweet Dionysus
She never really liked us
Hangs on and stays too long
And then supplies us all with vices
Sweet Pasadena
Sure would like to see ya
After a drink or two
Her engine's humming sweeter
I drove a miracle mile
I drove a miracle mile
It's cold in San Fernando
But only for a little while
Hey ma, don't ya be sad
I never knew nothing
But I got more than I owe
Mister Arkansas
He's gonna kill us all
A gold chain, an open flame
And a can of aerosol
I'm going down the river
Sweet Mary Queen
All eyes are fixеd upon
Her Dixieland machineI drovе a miracle mile
I drove a miracle mile
It's cold in San Fernando
But only for a little while
Hey ma, don't ya be sad
I never knew nothing
But I got more than I owe
Hey ma, oh don't ya be mad
I'm coming up light in my right hand
But I got more than I owe
