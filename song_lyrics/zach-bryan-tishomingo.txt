[Verse 1]
Well, I don't think that the city moves slow enough for me
So I'm gonna leave now and I ain't showin' no warnings
And I know that mama said her love will always lead you home
But I've been followin' this lonely road for way too long
[Chorus]
So won't you pray for me tonight?
I've been headin' down a dark, cold road
I've been dreamin' of a porch swing with some lights
Hopin' I can find myself back home
[Verse 2]
Now I'm breakin' horses out in Tishomingo
And every night I lie there and wonder where good men's dreams go
And most nights I wonder how far train cars can travel
Or how far a man can go before one's truly unraveled
[Chorus]
So won't you pray for me tonight?
I've been headin' down a dark, cold road
And I've been dreamin' of a porch swing with some lights
Hopin' I can find myself back home
[Verse 3]
Don't jump in so quick, kid, you're gonna wind up hurt
She's with a new man in New York the last time I heard
And I know that mama said her love will always lead me home
But I've been followin' a lonely road for way too long
[Chorus]
So won't you pray for me tonight?
I've been headin' down a dark, cold road
I've been dreamin' of you by my side
Prayin' I can get myself back home
