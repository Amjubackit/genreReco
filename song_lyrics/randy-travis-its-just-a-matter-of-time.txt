[Verse 1]
Someday, someway
You'll realize that you've been blind
Yes, darlin', you're gonna need me again
It's just a matter of time
[Verse 2]
Go on, go on
'Til you've reached the end of the line
'Cause I know, you'll pass my way again
It's just a matter of time
[Chorus]
After I gave you, everything I had
You laughed and called me a clown
Remember, in your search, for fortune and fame
What goes up, must come down
[Verse 3]
I... I know, I know
That one day you'll wake up and find
That my love is a true love
It's just a matter of time
[Bridge]
Someday, in some way
Girl, you'll realize that you've been blind
Yes, darlin', I know you're gonna need me again
It's just a matter of time
[Chorus]
After I gave you everything I had
You laughed and you called me a clown
But remember, in your search, for fortune and fame
What goes up, must come down
[Verse 4]
I... I know, I know
That one day you'll wake up and find
That my love was a true love
It's just a matter of time
