[Intro]
(Baby, I'm yours, yours, yours)
(Baby, I’m yours, yours, yours)
[Verse 1]
I know that you love me
Darling, you don't have to say it
You know you can trust me
It's okay, it’s complicated
[Pre-Chorus]
Nervous, trip over my words
You're so pretty it hurts
[Chorus]
Baby, I'm yours
Baby, I'm yours
Baby, I'm yours
I need something more
I'll pray to the Lord
That baby, I'm yours
[Verse 2]
Is it too late to see you?
I love the view of your headlights
Wanna get to know you (Know you)
Brought you to my house for the night
[Pre-Chorus]
Nervous, trip over my words
You're so pretty it hurts
[Chorus]
Baby, I’m yours
Baby, I’m yours
Baby, I'm yours
I need something more
I’ll pray to the Lord
That baby, I'm yours
[Bridge]
We're gettin' closer, inches away
Lose composure, favorite mistake
Friendship’s over, won't be the same
(Baby, I'm yours, yours, yours)
(Baby, I'm yours, yours, yours)
(I need something more)
(But baby, I'm yours)
[Chorus]
Baby, I'm yours
Baby, I'm yours
Baby, I'm yours
I need something more
I'll pray to the Lord
That baby, I'm yours
