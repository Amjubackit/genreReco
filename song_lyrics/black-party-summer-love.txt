[Verse]
Seatin' room clouds, puffin' on loud
We won't come down for later on
Watching the world spinnin' around
Bring you closer like tides to the moon
Take a walk around the beach (Yeah, yeah)
Put your feet in the sand (Yeah, yeah)
Don't you be scared (No, no)
I'll hold your hand (Yeah, yeah)
Nothin' can describe the feeling that I feel when I'm with you
Forevermore, I'll never forget you
[Chorus]
Baby, you can be my summer love
Wanna vibe with you, wanna get high with you
Get in the car and drive with you
Baby, you can be my summer love
Baby, can you be my summer love?
