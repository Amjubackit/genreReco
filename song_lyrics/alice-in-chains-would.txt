[Intro: Jerry Cantrell]
Would
[Verse 1: Jerry Cantrell, Jerry Cantrell & Layne Staley]
Know me, broken by my master
Teach thee on child of love hereafter
[Chorus: Layne Staley]
Into the flood again
Same old trip it was back then
So I made a big mistake
Try to see it once my way
[Verse 2: Jerry Cantrell, Jerry Cantrell & Layne Staley]
Drifting body, it's sole desertion
Flying not yet, quite the notion
[Chorus: Layne Staley]
Into the flood again
Same old trip it was back then
So I made a big mistake
Try to see it once my way
[Instrumental Break 02:05-02:22]
[Guitar Solo: Jerry Cantrell]
[Chorus: Layne Staley]
Into the flood again
Same old trip it was back then
So I made a big mistake
Try to see it once my way, yeah
[Outro: Layne Staley]
Am I wrong?
Have I run too far to get home?
Have I gone?
Left you here alone
Am I wrong?
Have I run too far to get home? Yeah
Have I gone?
Left you here alone
If I would, could you?
