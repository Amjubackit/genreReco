[Verse 1]
Been looking for You in the still and safe
But I feel You most in the wildest place
In the chaos, the madness, in the afraid
We uncover the reason
The greatest price You paid
[Pre-Chorus]
Let's go recklessly
Where the light has ceased
With a life let go I will let them know
[Chorus]
You can find me with the sinners
The rebels and the dreamers
Those hidden in the darkness
A glimpse of light
Take me where it hurts the hardest
How dangerous Your love is
You can find me with the sinners
Where You gave Your life
[Verse 2]
You knelt in the sand and You drew the line
But one without sin they could not find
For the broken rejected and the saved
You uncovered the reason
The greatest price you paid[Pre-Chorus]
Let's go recklessly
Where the light has ceased
With a life let go I will let them know
[Chorus]
You can find me with the sinners
The rebels and the dreamers
Those hidden in the darkness
A glimpse of light
Take me where it hurts the hardest
How dangerous Your love is
You can find me with the sinners
Where You gave Your life
[Bridge]
Take me where the hurting heart is
A hunger for the one that's starving
Show me the one that needs You
The silenced, the see-through
You go running out before me
I'm armored in all Your victory
To bring back Your long-lost family
To the shadows we go
To the shadows[Chorus]
You can find me with the sinners
The rebels and the dreamers
Those hidden in the darkness
A glimpse of light
Take me where it hurts the hardest
How dangerous Your love is
You can find me with the sinners
Where You gave Your life
You can find me with the sinners
Where You gave Your life
