Ah
[Verse 1]
Right in this moment I just feel so far from you (Mmm, ah)
Running out of options and I don't know what I'm gon' do
It's my own fault, Imma take the blame
Tried some new things, they just ain't the same
So I, I'm deciding to leave the door open, walk through (through)
[Pre-Chorus]
I've let this issue take too much of my time (take too much time away)
I've been stuck here in my own mind
Now I need to make a way for you to
[Chorus]
Come in (I need you to)
Come in (I need more of you)
Come in (Don't wanna be in here all alone)
