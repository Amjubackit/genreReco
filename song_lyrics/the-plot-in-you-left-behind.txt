[Verse 1]
Time has hit you different
But I don't think you've changed
Craving me was useless
All excuses drained
[Pre-Chorus]
Just know, all the sacrifice had robbed me of my time
Believe me, I don't look back, and I left with my pride
[Chorus]
I left behind everything you killed inside
Left you behind
You'd keep me down, I know better now
Won't bring me down again
[Verse 2]
I still keep your secrets
Know your worst mistakes
Played into my weakness
Stripped away my strength
[Pre-Chorus]
Onе day, you will see this all for how it truly was
Repeat evеry memory, it's all that's left of us[Chorus]
I left behind everything you killed inside
Left you behind
You'd keep me down, I know better now
Won't bring me down again
[Bridge]
Time has hit me different
I don't feel the same
Know I feel this distance
But I don't share the pain
I don't share the pain
No more
[Chorus]
I left behind everything you killed inside
Left you behind
You'd keep me down, I know better now
Won't bring me down again
