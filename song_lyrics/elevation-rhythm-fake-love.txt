[Chorus: Nate Diaz]
Never was enough 'til I met Ya
Got the real thing, found the real one
You can tell the world, "Keep the fake love"
'Cause I've been brand new since I woke up, hey
[Verse 1: Nate Diaz]
Yesterday, I met a man
He knew everywhere I'd been
He asked if we could be best friends
I took His hand, He took a chance
He showed me a different way
And gave me a brand new name
Now, I'll never be the same
Since I took His hand and took a chance
[Pre-Chorus: Brittany Diaz & Nate Diaz]
Didn't know how lost I was, but knew I couldn't measure up
Then You came around and You showed me
You were rewriting my story (Let's go)
Didn't know how lost I was, but knew I couldn't measure up
Then You came around and You showed me
You were rewriting my story (Let's go)
[Chorus: Nate Diaz & Brittany Diaz]
Never was enough 'til I met Ya
Got the real thing, found the real one
You can tell the world, "Keep the fake love"
'Cause I've been brand new since I woke up
[Post-Chorus: Nate Diaz & Brittany Diaz]
Since I woke up, since I woke up
[Verse 2: Nate Diaz & Brittany Diaz]
Living in a brand new day
All illusions fade away
And Your love's all that remains, You took my hand
[Pre-Chorus: Brittany Diaz & Nate Diaz]
Didn't know how lost I was, but knew I couldnâ€™t measure up
Then You came around and You showed me
You were rewriting my story (Let's go)
[Chorus: Nate Diaz & Brittany Diaz, Nate Diaz]
Never was enough 'til I met Ya
Got the real thing, found the real one
You can tell the world, "Keep the fake love"
'Cause I've been brand new since I woke up
(I said, "I never was enough...") Never was enough 'til I met Ya
Got the real thing, found the real one
You can tell the world, "Keep the fake love"
'Cause I've been brand new since I woke up
[Post-Chorus: Nate Diaz & Brittany Diaz, Brittany Diaz, Nate Diaz]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I've been brand new since I woke up
Who the Son sets free is free indeed (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I've been brand new since I woke up
[Chorus: Nate Diaz & Brittany Diaz, Nate Diaz]
Never was enough 'til I met Ya
Got the real thing, found the real one
You can tell the world, "Keep the fake love"
'Cause I've been brand new since I woke up
(One, two, one, two, three, let's go)
Never was enough 'til I met Ya
Got the real thing, found the real one
You can tell the world, "Keep the fake love"
'Cause I've been brand new since I woke up
(Said "I never was enough...") Never was enough 'til I met Ya
Got the real thing, found the real one
You can tell the world, "Keep the fake love"
'Cause I've been brand new since I woke up
[Outro: Nate Diaz & Brittany Diaz, Nate Diaz]
I've been brand new since I woke up
Who the Son sets free is free indeed
I've been brand new since I woke up
