I’m not in a hurry
I have no agenda but You
I’m only here for You
I long for Your presence
An imprint of Heaven its true
I’m only here for You
Let it rain down
Let it rain down
Pour over me
Pour over me
The river is coming
The dry and the barren will bloom
God is on the move
An army is rising
A wave of revival, it’s true
God is on the move
Living waters are rising
Bringing all things back to life
Living waters are rising up
‘Cause we wanna see You, show us Your glory
We wanna know You, oh Lord
We wanna see You, show us Your glory
We wanna know You, oh Lord
