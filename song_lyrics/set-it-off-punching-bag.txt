[Verse 1]
This empty feeling sets in my chest and I start to worry
Try to push it down, cast it out, but I can't control it, ah
Hanging on by the strings that you're pullin'
So you cut me down just to push me around like I'm your
[Pre-Chorus]
Punching bag
Just another pot calling the kettle black
Take it out on someone who won't hit you back
'Til we're all as broken as you
Oh, yeah
[Chorus]
So say goodbye to your Mr. Nice Guy
You got your wish, he's rotting in hell
I'm up all night when you think I'm sleeping
People-pleasing's never good for your health
So go fuck yourself
[Verse 2]
On this episode of "Friend or Foe?", you're throwing stones
And hope I'd tie a rope 'round my throat 'til I start to choke
You're a sick, persistent virus under my skin
Rather set myself on fire than let you win
I could give you the world, but you'd poison the seas
I could let down my guard, but then all that I'd be is just your
[Pre-Chorus]
Punching bag
Just another pot calling the kettle black
Take it out on someone who won't hit you back
'Til we're all as broken as you
Oh, yeah
[Chorus]
So say goodbye to your Mr. Nice Guy
You got your wish, he's rotting in hell
I'm up all night when you think I'm sleeping
People-pleasing's never good for your health
So go fuck yourself
[Chorus]
So say goodbye to your Mr. Nice Guy
You got your wish, he's rotting in hell
I'm up all night when you think I'm sleeping
People-pleasing's never good for your health
Say goodbye to your Mr. Nice Guy
You got your wish, he's rotting in hell
I'm up all night when you think I'm sleeping
People-pleasing's never good for your health
So go fuck yourself
