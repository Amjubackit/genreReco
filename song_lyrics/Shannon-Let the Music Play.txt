[Verse 1]
We started dancing
And love put us into a groove
As soon as we started to move
The music played
While our bodies
Displayed through the dance
Then love picked us out for romance
I thought it was clear
The plan was we would share
This feeling just between ourselves
But when the music changed
The plan was rearranged
He went to dance with someone else
[Pre-Chorus]
We started dancing
And love put us into a groove
But now he's with somebody new
What does love want me to do?
Love said
[Chorus]
Let the music play
He won't get away
Just keep the groove
And then he'll come back to you again
(Let it play)
