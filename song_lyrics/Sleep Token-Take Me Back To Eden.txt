[Verse 1]
I dream in phosphorescence
Bleed through spaces
See you drifting past the fog
But no one told you where to go
We dive through crystal waters
Perfect oceans
But no one told me not to breathe
And now the weightlessness recedes
[Chorus]
My, my, those eyes like fire
I'm a winged insect, you're a funeral pyre
Come now, 
bite through these wire
s
I'm a waking hell and thе gods grow tired
Reset my patiеnt violence along both lines of a pathway higher
Grow back your sharpest teeth, you know my desire
[Refrain]
I will travel far beyond the path of reason
Take me back to Eden
Take me back to Eden
Take me back to Eden
[Verse 2]
Well, yeah, I spit blood when I wake up
Sink porcelain stained, choking up brain matter and make-up
Just two days since the mainframe went down and I'm still messed up
Room feels like a meat freezer I dangle in like cold cuts
Missed calls, answer phones from people I just don't trust
Mirror talk, fake love
But I'll take a pound of your flesh before you take a piece of my paystub
White roses, black dove
s
Godmother, rise up
I need you to see me for what I have become
