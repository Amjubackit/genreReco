[Verse 1]
I've should've known better
Than to give that girl a chance
I wish I never met her
'Cause now she's with another man
Maybe he can dance better than I can
Maybe he's got them softer bitch boy hands
Maybe he can keep you out this town
[Chorus]
And maybe stay on your side of that county line
'Cause you've got your friends, darlin', I've got mine
I heard you're in town, been ridin' around
With somebody new and probably burnin' it down
You don't wanna be seen rollin' in my bar
'Cause everybody here knows how you broke my heart
Stay out of dodge, stay out of my life
Stay out of this town and stay on your side of that county line
[Post-Chorus]
You prolly think it's funny
What you're doin' to me
I'm really dyin' inside
Look what you're doin' to me
You prolly think it's funny
What you're doin' to me
I'm really dyin' inside
Look what you're doin' to me
[Verse 2]
I thought we'd be forever
But you couldn't make up your mind
And maybe you'll remember when you kiss him
You used to sleep here every night
Maybe he's makin' more money than I can
Maybe he's got more followers on Instagram
Maybe he can get you off my mind
[Chorus]
And maybe stay on your side of that county line
'Cause you've got your friends, darlin', I've got mine
I heard you're in town, been ridin' around
With somebody new, you're probably burnin' it down
You don't wanna be seen rollin' in my bar (In my bar)
'Cause everybody here knows how you broke my heart
Stay out of dodge, stay out of my life
Stay out of this town and stay on your side of that county line
[Post-Chorus]
You prolly think it's funny
What you're doin' to me
I'm really dyin' inside
Look what you're doin' to me
You prolly think it's funny
What you're doin' to me
I'm really dyin' inside
Look what you're doin' to me
[Chorus]
You can stay on your side of that county line
You've got your friends, darlin', I've got mine
I heard you're in town, riding' around
With somebody new, you're probably burnin' it down
You don't wanna be seen rollin' in my bar
'Cause everybody here knows how you broke my heart
Stay out of dodge, stay out of my life
Stay out of this town and stay on your side of that county line
[Post-Chorus]
You prolly think it's funny
What you're doin' to me
I'm really dyin' inside (And stay on your side of that country line)
Look what you're doin' to me
You prolly think it's funny
What you're doin' to me
I'm really dyin' inside
Look what you're doin' to me
[Outro]
You prolly think it's funny
What you're doin' to me
I'm really dyin' inside
Look what you're doin' to me
