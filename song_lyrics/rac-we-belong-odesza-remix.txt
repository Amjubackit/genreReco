[Verse 1: Katie Herzig]
There's a way that you look me straight in the eyes
Only last for a moment, it last through the night
It's so easy to hold you
You're so easy to mold to
It's a dream to be close to you
Didn't know you were meant for me
[PreChorus: Katie Herzig]
Until you came to me
Until it came to be
Until I came to see
Until you came to be
[Chorus: Katie Herzig]
We belong to where we're going
Where we're going
We belong to where we're going
Where we're going
We belong to where we're going
Where we're going
We belong to where we're going
Where we're going
[Chorus: Katie Herzig]
We belong to where we're going
Where we're going
We belong to where we're going
Where we're going
We belong to where we're going
Where we're going
We belong to where we're going
Where we're going[Outro: Katie Herzig]
