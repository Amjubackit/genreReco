[Verse 1]
You've got this new head filled up with smoke
And I've got my veins all tangled close
To those jukebox bars you frequent
The safest place to hide
A long night spent with your most obvious weakness, you start shaking at the thought
You are everything I want
'Cause you are everything I'm not
[Pre-Chorus]
And we lay, we lay together
Just not too close, too close
(How close is close enough?)
And we lay, we lay together
Just not too close, too close
[Chorus]
I just wanna break you down so badly
Well I trip over everything you say
I just wanna break you down so badly
In the worst way
[Verse 2]
My inarticulate store-bought hangover hobby kit it talks
And it says "You, oh, you are so cool"
Scissor-shaped across the bed
You are red, violent red
You hollow out my hungry eyes
You hollow out my hungry eyes
