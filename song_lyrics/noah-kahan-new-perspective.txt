[Verse 1]
Ooh, silence is making me nostalgic
Two sizes big your shirt in my apartment
Oh, we were kids, but that don't make this less hard
If I could fly I doubt I'd even do it
I'd probably get high and crash or something stupid
You made Ohio feel just like Central Park
[Pre-Chorus]
Liberal rednecks get drunk on a dirt road
Attention deficit kids in their gym clothes
Paper bags drift wherever the wind blows
And mine's full of receipts
[Chorus]
Ooh, this town's for the record now
The intersection got a Target
And they're calling it downtown
You and all of your new perspective now
Wish I could shut it in a closet
And drag you back down
[Verse 2]
Gave me your word and now I can't pronounce it
No thing so sure that I can't learn to doubt it
Now the state bird, it sings our song so out of key
[Pre-Chorus]
Liberal rednecks get drunk on a dirt road
Attention deficit kids in their gym clothes
Paper bags drift wherever the wind blows
And mine's full of receipts
[Chorus]
Ooh, this town's for the record now
The intersection got a Target
And they're calling it downtown
You and all of your new perspective now
Wish I could shut it in a closet
And drag you back down
[Bridge]
And drag you back down
[Pre-Chorus]
Liberal rednecks get drunk on a dirt road
Attention deficit kids in their gym clothes
Paper bags drift wherever the wind blows
And mine's full of receipts
[Chorus]
Ooh, this town's for the record now
The intersection got a Target
And they're calling it downtown
You and all of your new perspective now
Wish I could shut it in a closet
And drag you back down
And drag you back down
And drag you back down
