[Verse 1]
I saw you standing there
Sandy blonde hair, the way it came tumbling down
Just like a waterfall
And if you need a light
I'll be the match to your candle
My darling, I'm ready, to burst into flames for you
[Pre-Chorus]
I was just coasting till we met
You remind me just how good it can get
[Chorus]
Well I've been on fire, dreaming of you
Tell me you don't
It feels like you do
Looking like that, you'll open some wounds
How does it start?
And when does it end?
Only been here for a moment, but I know I want you
But is it too soon?
To know that I'm with you
There's nothing I can do
[Verse 2]
And sometime around one
We fell asleep to escape from the sun
And we woke up to the sound of a storm outside
We stood at your front door
You looked at me and said "Baby, this rain changes everything"
And my heart ran away from me
