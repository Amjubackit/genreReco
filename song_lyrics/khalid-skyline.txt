[Intro]
It's a Wednesday night
 and we're running out of time
Won't you take my hand, hop into my skyline?
It's only just a rebuild, but I swear it feels real
When you take my hand in my passenger side
[Verse 1]
All lights, all on you
City lights fall on you
Such a beautiful world
We're so high, I'm with you
Hypnotized, I'm with you
Such a beautiful world
[Pre-Chorus]
It's like I'm livin' my dream out, dream out, yeah
Feels like we're on LSD, all day out, yeah
[Chorus]
It's a Wednesday night and we're running out of time
Won't you take my hand, hop into my skyline?
It's only just a rebuild, but I swear it feels real
When you take my hand in my passenger side
It's a Wednesday night and we're running out of time
Won't you take my hand, hop into my skyline?
It's only just a rebuild, but I swear it feels real
When you take my hand in my passenger side[Verse 2]
Leave it all in our rearview as we pass the finish line
It's just us, yeah, it's you and I racin' under the green light
Feel the rush intensify, lately I feel so alive
Such a beautiful world, oh
[Pre-Chorus]
It's like I'm living my dream out, dream out, yeah
Feels like we're on LSD, all day out, yeah
[Chorus]
It's a Wednesday night and we're running out of time
Won't you take my hand, hop into my skyline?
It's only just a rebuild, but I swear it feels real
When you take my hand in my passenger side
It's a Wednesday night and we're running out of time (Time)
Won't you take my hand, hop into my skyline? (Skyline)
It's only just a rebuild (Yeah), but I swear it feels real
When you-
[Outro]
When you, when you
Yeah
Take my hand
Take my hand
Take my hand
Take my hand
