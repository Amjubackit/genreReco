You're a bitter kind
I love you so
Sour is my mind
From what you sow
How I let it grow
Call them radiant
Call them mother's eyes
Home's a narrow space for me to find
Your beguilling state in endless heights
I'm just not moving right
Just not moving right when its just not you
Under neon lights
Where I wake
I'm not feeling right
So they say
Rough kind of a day
Don my clothing, robes of ancient white
Rattled windows on the old green line
Do you feel it like I hope you might?
I'm just not seeing right
Just not seeing right
When it's just not you
