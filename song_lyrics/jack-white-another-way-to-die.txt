[Verse 1: Jack White & 
Alicia Keys
]
Another ringer with the slick trigger finger for Her Majesty
Another one with the golden tongue poisoning your fantasy
Another bill from a killer, turned a thriller to a tragedy
[Chorus: Jack White & Alicia Keys]
Yeah, a door left open, a woman walking by
A drop in the water, a look in your eye
A phone on the table, a man on your side
Or someone that you think that you can trust
It's just another way to die
[Verse 2: Jack White & 
Alicia Keys
]
Another tricky little gun giving
 
solace
 to the one
That'll never see the sun shine
Another inch of your life sacrificed for your brother, in the nick of time
Another dirty money, heaven sent honey, turning on a dime
[Chorus: Jack White & Alicia Keys]
Well, a door left open, a woman walking by
A drop in the water, a look in your eye
A phone on the table, a man on your side
Or someone that you think that you can trust
It's just another way to die
[Bridge: Jack White & Alicia Keys]
It's just another
Hey!
It's just another
You're nothing to me, die
It's just another
Shoot 'em, bang, bang![Verse 3: Jack White & 
Alicia Keys
, 
Both
]
Another girl with her finger on the world
Singing to you what you wanna hear
Another gun thrown down in surrender took away your fear, hey
Another man there, he stands right behind you looking in the mirror
[Chorus: Jack White & Alicia Keys]
A door left open, a woman walking by
A drop in the water, a look in the eye
A phone on the table, a man on your side
Or someone that you think that you can trust
It's just another way to die
[Outro: Jack White & 
Alicia Keys
]
It's just another
It's just another
It's just another way!
Shoot 'em up, bang, bang
Hey! Hey!
It's just another
Yeah! Yeah!
It's just another
It's just another
It's just another
It's just another day!
Bang, bang, bang, bang
