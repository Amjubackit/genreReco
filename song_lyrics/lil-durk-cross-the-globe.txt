[Intro: Lil Durk & 
Juice WRLD
]
Oh, oh

(Out of here, out of here)
Wheezy, out of here

Ayy, Wheezy, we out of here
 (Out of here, out of here)

 (Out of here, out of here)
[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
Uh, fell in love with her tongue, yeah, told bro he gotta try some
She say, "Nigga, is you dumb? I ain't fuckin' both of y'all, only just one"
Then she seen that money come, me countin' up Benjamin Franklins
Yeah, when she seen that, she took my brother to the room and said, "I'll be right back"
[Verse 1: Juice WRLD]
Little bit of rock, little bit of rap
Sold a lot of rock, I don't gotta cap
I was in the trap totin' on the Glock
Whippin' on the stove, cookin' up the pot
Whole world in my hands, keep it on lock
Been through a lot shit, still shell-shocked
I got the juice, feel like 2Pac
They tryna kill me in the black Bimmer like 2Pac
I'm finna feed 'em the rounds
Finger-fuck the glizzy
, I ain't fuckin' around
She fuckin' on me when her man out of town
We get up off them uppers, it go down
Smoke 'til my eyes look Ming, no Yao
I'ma ball on these niggas like Ming, no Yao
How you want beef, but you a pussy?
Never seen a kitty act like a cow[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
Uh, fell in love with her tongue, yeah, told bro he gotta try some
She say, "Nigga, is you dumb? I ain't fuckin' both of y'all, only just one"
Then she seen that money come, me countin' up Benjamin Franklins
Yeah, when she seen that, she took my brother to the room and said, "I'll be right back" (Uh)
[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
Deep in her guts, she screamin' out facts (Facts)
Screamin', "Free Thug," I'm screamin', "Free Slatt" (Slatt)
Let Melly out, I'm sorry 'bout X (X)
I know the owner, I took her to Catch (Oh)
Baby got off of Amiri, sayin' he all Chrome, but I'm bringin' him back
I hate the trollin' they do when you die
Honestly, them niggas really be foul (Yeah, yeah)
50 want to shoot a movie, but I was just tellin' him this real
On set in Chicago, anybody can get killed
The internet thinkin' they hurtin' me, stop it
I'm Smurkio, I gave out scholarships
The biggest before I was positive
[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
Uh, fell in love with her tongue, yeah, told bro he gotta try some
She say, "Nigga, is you dumb? I ain't fuckin' both of y'all, only just one"
Then she seen that money come, me countin' up Benjamin Franklins
Yeah, when she seen that, she took my brother to the room and said, "I'll be right back
"
