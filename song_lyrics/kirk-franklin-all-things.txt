[Intro]
Can I talk to ya?
I know you got some questions
What's the hardest thing you're going through?
Let's talk about it
[Chorus]
Talkin' 'bout mountains, talkin' 'bout pain
Talkin' 'bout my life, when will it change?
Talkin' 'bout all things
God can do all things
Talkin 'bout night time, lose my way
And my dreams that have been erased
Talkin' 'bout all things
I said God can do all things
I understand
I know days, it won't always be easy
Yeah
So it's good to know I'II never let You down
Talkin 'bout all things
All the big and the small things
I'm so sure
God can do all things
Talkin' 'bout doubts that flood my mind
I'm out of funds and l'm out of time
I need a blessing
I need You to do all things
See, I understand that
I know days it won't always be easy
And just in case I fall
So it's good to know I'II never let You down
Yeah
Talkin' 'bout all things
All things
All the big and the small things
Yeah
God can do all things
Say it again, yeah
Talkin' 'bout all things
All the big and the small things
Let's go
God can do all things
[Verse 1]
Just bеcause He's silent
Doеsn't mean that He's still
He's not only preparing it for you
He's preparing you for it
Let's go
[Chorus]
Talkin 'bout all things (Woo)
All the big and the small things (Hallelujah)
Talkin' 'bout doors you've never seen (Yeah)
Blessings on blessings for you to receive
Talkin 'bout all things (Ha-ha)
All the big and the small things (He sees You)
Talkin' 'bout doors you've never seen (Yes)
Blessings on blessings for you to receive
Talkin' 'bout all things (See the blessing's coming)
All the big and the small things (But He had to get you ready for it)
Talkin' 'bout doors you've never seen (Yessir)
Blessings on blessings for you to receive (What we talkin' 'bout?)
