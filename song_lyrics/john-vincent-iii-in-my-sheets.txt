Walking through the lonesome river valley
Where my mother said that I would be
Wondering what kind of man I will be
Maybe like my father back when he was young
So will you carry me to the delta where the water will touch my skin?
And the oxygen will give me life
Will you take me there, my lover? I don't think I'll make it out
Of the hell I created in my mind
Maybe somewhere like Virginia, love
Maybe somewhere like Virginia, babe
Maybe one day I'll be all alone in my sheets
But when I wake, I pray that I see you
I see you one more time
My bloodshot eyes are blinding me
Oh, they're only masking the feelings inside of me
Boy, on the river I see in front of me, oh yeah
Oh, it's never enough to fill my needs
So will you carry me home, my dear?
Where I first felt love and fear
Where I smoked a cigarette, you coughed a lung
Will you take me there, my lover? I don't think I'll make it out
Of the hell I created in my mind
Maybe somewhere like Ohio, love
Maybe somewhere like Ohio, babe
And I, I need some time
To breathe, to escape my head
Oh, and the photos, they hang
On my wall now, baby
And I can't take them down 'cause they're all I have now
Maybe one day I'll be all alone in my sheets
But when I wake, I pray that I see you
One more time
And I been trying, I been crying
I been dying just to see you
One more time
And I, I, I
No, no, no
