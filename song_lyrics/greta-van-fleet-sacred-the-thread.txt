[Verse 1]
The sequins, mmm
Tripping on the light
Oh
I feel it, ah
Hugging me so tight
Woah-woah, woah-woah
Woah-woah, woah-woah
[Pre-Chorus]
I've seen it in the stars
To dress up a wound, heal a scar
[Chorus]
I've caught the wind
In a kite of dreams, in a flight of seams
Like freedom sewn
And the people roar, and the people soar
Sacred the thread, sacred the thread
I've caught the wind
In a kite of dreams, in a flight of seams
[Verse 2]
I see me
Through colors, gems and trim
Oh
Unraveled, uh
The glow that was once dim
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[Pre-Chorus]
I've seen it in the stars
To dress up a wound, heal a scar
[Chorus]
I've caught the wind
In a kite of dreams, in a flight of seams
Like freedom sewn
And the people roar, and the people soar
Sacred the thread, sacred the thread
I've caught the wind
In a kite of dreams, in a flight of seams
[Bridge]
Oh-woah, oh-woah
Oh-woah, oh-woah
Ooh, ooh
Ah
[Chorus]
I've caught the wind
In a kite of dreams, in a flight of seams
Like freedom sewn
And the people roar, and the people soar
Sacred the thread, sacred the thread
I've caught the wind
In a kite of dreams, in a flight of seams
[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh
Sacred the thread, sacred the thread
I've caught the wind
In a kite of dreams, in a flight of seams
