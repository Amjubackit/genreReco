[Intro]
Yeah
[Verse 1]
Sink until you're unimpaired
Slow motion like a rolling eye
We can hear you loud and clear
Suicide season is upon and high
Why you always saying, "Let the good times roll"?
Kick your mind open like a punk rock show
Uppercut, bleeding through the soffit nose
If you didn't come home injured, would you say it was a good show?
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause every single fucking day
I try to roll my eyes and breathe
[Chorus]
One hit, now I'm off this shit
Give up, give up, give up, give up
Give up, give up, I can't hear you
Through the tension, through the tension
Through th–µ tension, right now
[Interlude]
This is only a distraction
