[Intro: MNDR and 
Kele
]
Oh, oh, oh, yay
Oh, oh, oh, yay
Oh, oh, oh, yay 
(
You are golden, you are pure
)
Oh, oh, oh, yay 
(
You are golden, you are pure
)
[Verse 1: Kele]
Tell me, tell me, tell me your problems
I’m here for you
Just try, just try, just try to stay sober
It’s eating you
And they say you are a monster, but what I see’s a child
Your eyes, your eyes are glowing red
And your tongue has caught on fire
[Pre-Chorus: Kele and 
MNDR
]
You are golden, you are pure
 (
Oh, oh, oh, yay
)
You are golden, beautiful (
Oh, oh, oh, yay
)
[Chorus: MNDR]
So let go, let go of your fire
Let it go, let go of your fire
Live it up ‘til we crash and there’s smoke in the air (Oh, oh, oh, yay)
Let it go, let go of your fire
[Post-Chorus: MNDR]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
