[Verse 1: Howard Hewett]
It's got to be real
Girl, I could write a book on how you're making me feel
I know I'll never find
Another who could match the love you've given to me
So
[Chorus: Shalamar, 
Howard Hewett
]
This is for the lover in you
This ring 
means I'll always be true
This is 
how we'll start love anew
This time, it's gonna last forever
[Verse 2: Howard Hewett]
I trust you, yes, I do
And girl, you're not the kind a guy could easily charm
'Cause the meaning of love
Is always shown to me when you are wrapped in my arms
Oh baby
[Chorus: Shalamar, 
Howard Hewett
]
This is for the lover in you
This ring (
This ring means I'll always be true
)
This is 
how we'll start love anew
This time, it's gonna last forever
(
I don't wanna, I don't want to give you up
)
This is for the lover in you (
I love you, baby
)
This ring (
Ooh
)
This is (
For the lover in you, girl
)
This time, it's gonna last forever[Bridge: Howard Hewett]
I could say I never met a girl, no, no
Who satisfies my mental and my physical thing
When I lay me down to sleep
I'm rest assured with the thought that you are right next to me
My baby
[Chorus: Shalamar, 
Howard Hewett
]
This is for the lover in you (
Take this ring
)
This ring (
It means I'll always be true
)
This is 
how we'll start love anew
This time, it's gonna last forever
This is for the lover in you (
Take my ring
)
This ring (
Oh, oh, oh
)
This is (
Sweet baby
)
This time, we're gonna be together
[Outro: Howard Hewett, 
Shalamar
]
Oh, so much love between us
I'll be the one to come running (
Be the one to come running
)
Oh, home to you (
Home to you
)
You give me sweet love
With a woman like you, I don't need to play around
Oh, you're more than just one woman
You're blowing my mind with the love that you're giving
That's what you hear me say
Girl, every day
(
This is
)
It's for the lover in you, baby
(
For the lover in you
)
With this ring (
This ring
), I'll show you that there ain't no maybes
(
This is
)
It's for the lover in you, baby
And this time
, we're gonna last 
forever
(
This is
)
It's for the lover in you, baby
(
For the lover in you
)
With this ring (
This ring
), I show you that there ain't no maybes
(
This is
)
It's for the lover in you, baby
And this time
, we're gonna be 
together
(
This is
)
It's for the lover in you, baby
(
For the lover in you
)
With this ring (
This ring
), I show you that there ain't no maybes
(
This is
)
It's for the lover in you, baby
And this time
, we're gonna last 
forever
