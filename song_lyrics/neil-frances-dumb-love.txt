[Chorus]
Dumb love and I do
Love to be lied to
Dumb lovin', sane lovin'
I know we'll meet again
[Verse 1]
I could feel alri-ight
This is where my lips open
Every time I walk away
I find it, a real love, no friend of mine
Thinking that I should have known
I find a new way on my own
Must be the way your love is sho-o-own
Makes me feel so dumb
I gotta get somethi-i-ing
[Chorus]
Dumb love and I do
Love to be lied to
Dumb love, sane lovin'
No, there will be no day
[Verse 2]
Some love and I know
There's skill, a mile, Lou
Some lovin', say something
I know we'll be okay[Verse 3]
Day I'll be thick like a pig with no heart
Race to the finish before we start
Woah oh-oh
Woah oh-oh
[Verse 4]
Looking for sparks in the dead of the dark
You'll leave no fire, and I've known more
Woah oh-oh
Woah oh-oh
[Chorus]
Dumb love and I do (Woah oh-oh)
Love to be lied to (Woah oh-oh)
Dumb love, sane loving
No, there will be no day
Some love, and I know (Woah oh-oh)
They skip a mile, Lou (Woah oh-oh)
Some love
Say something
I know we'll be okay
[Bridge]
Woah, woah oh-oh
Woah, woah oh-oh[Instrumental]
Woah-ah, woah-ah
Woah-ah, woah-ah
Woah-ah, woah-ah
Woah-ah, woah-ah, oh-oh
Woah-ah, woah-ah
Woah-ah, woah-ah
Woah-ah, woah-ah
Woah-ah, woah-ah
Woah-ah, woah-ah
Woah-ah, woah-ah
Woah-ah, woah-ah
Woah-ah, woah-ah, oh-oh
[Outro]
Dumb love, and I do (Woah oh-oh)
Love to be lied to (Woah oh-oh)
Done lovin', sayin' nothin'
Now, there will be no day
Sun, love and I know
They skip a mile, Lou
Sun, love, say somethin'
I know we'll be okay
