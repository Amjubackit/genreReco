[Verse 1]
If living’s got it’s options
Find me on the side that’s all in
If faith requires actions
Even if it’s blind, I’m going
[Pre-Chorus]
To every question
You are what I believe
Wherever You’re going
God, that's where I wanna be
[Chorus]
You dare me to move where I can’t see
Ready to do what used to scare me
Faith is a step into eternity
If you want Him, say you’re all in
Dare me to move where I can’t see
Ready to do what used to scare me
Faith is a stеp into eternity
If you want Him, say you’re all in
[Post-Chorus]
If you want Him, say you’rе all in
If you want Him[Verse 2]
One moment in Your presence
This is where the life change begins
It’s like a chain reaction
All it takes is one spark to spread
[Pre-Chorus]
To every question
You are what I believe
Wherever You’re going
God, that's where I wanna be
[Chorus]
You dare me to move where I can’t see
Ready to do what used to scare me
Faith is a step into eternity
If you want Him, say you’re all in
Dare me to move where I can’t see
Ready to do what used to scare me
Faith is a step into eternity
If you want Him, say you’re all in
[Post-Chorus]
If you want Him, say you’re all in
If you want Him[Bridge]
I believe it
I receive it
I believe in You
I believe it
I receive it
I believe in You
(One, two, three, go)
[Interlude]
If you want Him, say you’re all in
If you want Him, say you’re all in
[Chorus]
You dare me to move where I can’t see
Ready to do what used to scare me
Faith is a step into eternity
If you want Him, say you’re all in
Dare me to move where I can’t see
Ready to do what used to scare me
Faith is a step into eternity
If you want Him, say you’re all in
