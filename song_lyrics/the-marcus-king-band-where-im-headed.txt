Hangin’ out of my window
Leaning over my railing
Trying to see what she's found as she goes
What she found as she goes
Hear the sound of my highway
I get stoned as I pray
Think I’ll just fade away
Who’s gonna care now
Lord who’s gonna care
'Cause I don’t know where I’m headed, babe
But I know I’ll see you there
'Cause I don’t where I’m headed, babe
But I know I’ll see you there
She came down from the mountain
Singing songs to me
Always left me wondering where she may be
All the places that she’s seen
Hear the thunder in the sky
See the pain in her eyes
You’re always safe here with me
But your heart is somewhere else
And I don’t know where I’m headed, babe
But I know I’ll see you there
And I don’t where I’m headed, babe
But I know I’ll see you there
Hanging out of my window
Leaning over my railing
Trying to see what she's found as she goes
What she's found as she's going
She came down from the mountain
Singing songs to me
Always left me wondering where she may be
All the places that she’s seen
’Cause I don’t know where I’m headed, babe
But I know I’ll see you there
'Cause I don’t where I’m headed, babe
But I know I’ll see you there
