[Verse 1]
Fuck your mind up, waste time
Iâ€™m prone to that, do it all the time
Keep your guard up or wait in line
You don't need me, please believe me
This ain't easy, you know I've been feindin'
Let me unleash my demons on you
[Chorus]
What's the word? Tell me what you've heard
Don't tell me what to do, just tell me when it hurts
When I get you to myself, it's murder
What's the word? Tell me what you've heard
Don't tell me what to do, just tell me when it hurts
When I get you to myself, it's murder
[Verse 2]
What you mean, you and me? I'm here all by myself
You around, she's around, let's be polite and not leave her out
What the fuck you call this? Hopeless, not romantic
I ain't got no kids, so don't be so childish
You be wildin', I be wildin', too
But not like you, shit, maybe a little like you
Maybe we ain't so different, maybe I be trippin', too
[Chorus]
What's the word? Tell me what you've heard
Don't tell me what to do, just tell me when it hurts
When I get you to myself, it's murder
What's the word? Tell me what you've heard
Don't tell me what to do, just tell me when it hurts
When I get you to myself, it's murder[Verse 3]
If he was a winner
Girl, you wouldn't have to worry 'bout a damn thing
If I was up in it, shit, I bet a pound that I'd put it down
Make you forget that you was ever with him
And I hate talking 'bout my stroke game
But girl, I'm giving you the whole thing
I could put like 25 on your finger, five for your shades
So you can't see these other niggas
They won't call you again, that's enough
I could see you're wasting time
Would you pay it out to me? You're in the wrong hands
I just want to clock in, night and day, I'll stay
I'll be more open if you keep it open
[Outro]
Let me hear that
