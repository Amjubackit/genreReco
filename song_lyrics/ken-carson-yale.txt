[Verse]
Uh, I keep your ho upstairs
When she wanna fuck, I just tell her, "Ring the bell"
Hit her from the back, she can't do nothing but yell
And she smart as fuck, I got this bitch straight out of Yale
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And you know I'm high as fuck, my eyes just red, but they was just pale
If it's up, then nigga, it's stuck, don't come outside, not even for air
Got a Glocky on my hip and I'll blow this bitch just like a ref'
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Niggas thinking this shit sweet 'til one of they partners disappear
Give a fuck 'bout your mama crying, give a fuck 'bout that lil' bitch shedding tears
Gotta keep the fire by your side because the opps is always near
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Double cup, ho, I sip lean, know all these old niggas sip beer
All I do is just lead and all these lil' niggas just cheer
20/20 my vision, but I swear this shit ain't been clear
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
