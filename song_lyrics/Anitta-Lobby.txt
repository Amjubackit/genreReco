[Intro: Missy Eliott]
This is that new Anitta, suckers
Hmm, let's go
[Chorus: Anitta]
Kiss me from the roof to the lobby
Your lips on my body
They work like a hobby
Wanna see you kiss me from the roof to the lobby
Your lips on my body
Then talk till you've got me
Wanna see you
[Verse 1: Anitta & 
Missy Elliott
]
Baby, I ain't tryna wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
I know that you know this (
Woo
)
Two sips in, you've gone straight to my head (
Okay
)
Lately, I've been on the way, way, way, way, way
I know that you know this (Know this)
Three nights in, you can't leave my bed
[Pre-Chorus: Anitta & 
Missy Elliott
]
There's a golden door that leads to paradise, 'dise
I gave you all my keys, so let yourself inside, inside (
Woo
)
[Chorus: Anitta & 
Missy Elliott
]
Kiss me from the roof to the lobby (
Ayy
)
Your lips on my body (
Ayy
)
They work like a hobby
Wanna see you kiss me from the roof to the lobby
Your lips on my body
Then talk till you've got me (
Anitta
)
Wanna see you (
Let's go, let's go
)
