[Verse 1]
Break through
Break through
Through (You need to break that shell)
Break through
Break it, baby, break it
Break through
I can see you're dancin' now (Break through)
I can see you're dancin' now
My phantom
Break through (Baby)
[Chorus]
Baby, baby, it's alright
Oh, get on up and shake it tonight
Baby, baby, I can tell
You wanna break through your shell (So break)
Baby, baby, it's alright
Oh, get on up and shake it tonight
Baby, baby, I can tell
You want, you want, you want
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 2]
Break through
You need to break that shell
Break through
Break it, baby, break it
Break through
I can see you're dancin' now (Break through)
I can see you're dancin' now
My phantom (Woo)
Break through (Baby)
