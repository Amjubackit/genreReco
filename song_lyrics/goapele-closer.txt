[Intro]
Closer to my dreams
It's coming over me
I'm getting higher
Closer to my dreams
I'm getting higher and higher
Feel it in my sleep
[Verse 1]
Sometimes it feels like I'll never go past here
Sometimes it feels like I'm stuck forever, ever
 (Like I'm stuck forever)
[Chorus]
But I'm going higher
Closer to my dreams
I'm going higher and higher
I can almost reach
[Verse 2]
Sometimes you just have to let it go (Let it go, let it go)
Leaving all my fears to burn and die
Push them all away so I can move on
Closer to my dreams
Feel it all over my being, in my being
Close your eyes and seek what you believe[Chorus]
I'm moving higher, higher, oh, oh
I'm going higher and higher and higher and higher
Closer to my dreams
(Higher and higher, oh, oh)
[Verse 3]
I'm moving upward and onward and beyond all that I could see
(Stretching out my arms so I can reach)
I'm so close it's like I can just reach
I can feel my dreams
Closer to my dreams
I'm moving closer to my dreams
Ooh
[Outro]
Sometimes it feel like you'll never gonna change
(Never gonna change)
But you never choose to walk away
