[Verse 1]
Girl, when I'm gone I know you'll miss me
Sing our songs when you get tipsy
Well I found home beside the whisky
I still get stoned from your memories
[Chorus]
No I don't need you
To tell me that I'm wrong
Did it dong for you
Missed calls in my phone,  don't tell me
You moved on, that ain't grown of you
[Verse 2]
Rain drops falling like the day I left you bawling
Don't you sell it short my darling
Them lies will come right back on you
You won't catch me squealing
Or find me breaking my nails crawling
I bet you heard I found my calling
With that six string I played for you
So fire away
I'm tired today
So you know I won't fight you back
My mind is in a race
I give and you take
And I gave everything I had
[Chorus]
No I don't need you
To tell me that I'm wrong
Did it dong for you
Missed calls in my phone,  don't tell me
You moved on, that ain't grown of you
[Verse 3]
Styrofoam singing along
I'm pouring it strong oh lord I am
Now that I'm gone, I'll get along
But if I look back, I'll be damned
I'll find myself with somebody else
I hope you find a better man
We're killing ourselves going through hell
Girl, that blood ain't on my hands
Girl, when I'm gone I know you'll miss me
You'll sing our songs when you get tipsy
Well I found home beside the whiskey
I still get stoned off your memories
[Chorus]
No I don't need you
To tell me I'm wrong
Did it dong for you
Missed calls in my phone, don't tell me
You moved on, that ain't grown of you
