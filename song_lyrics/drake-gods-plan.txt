[Intro]
And they wishin' and wishin'
And wishin' and wishin', they wishin' on me
Yeah
[Verse 1]
I been movin' calm, don't start no trouble with me
Tryna keep it peaceful is a struggle for me
Don't pull up at 6 AM to cuddle with me
You know how I like it when you lovin' on me
I don't wanna die for them to miss me
Yes, I see the things that they wishin' on me
Hope I got some brothers that outlive me
They gon' tell the story, shit was different with me
[Chorus]
God's plan, God's plan
I hold back, sometimes I won't, yeah
I feel good, sometimes I don't (Ayy, don't)
I finessed down Weston Road (Ayy, 'nessed)
Might go down a G.O.D. (Yeah, wait)
I go hard on Southside G (Yeah, wait)
I make sure that north-side eat
And still
[Post-Chorus]
Bad things
It's a lot of bad things that they wishin' and wishin'
And wishin' and wishin', they wishin' on me
Bad things
It's a lot of bad things that they wishin' and wishin'
And wishin' and wishin', they wishin' on me
Yeah, ayy, ayy
