[Hook 1: Ali Campbell]
Red, red wine
Goes to my head
Makes me forget that I
Still need her so
Red, red wine
It's up to you
All I can do, I've done
Memories won't go
Memories won't go
[Verse 1: Ali Campbell]
I'd have sworn, that with time
Thoughts of you would leave my head
I was wrong, now I find
Just one thing makes me forget
[Hook 2: Ali Campbell]
Red, red wine
Stay close to me
Don't let me be in love
It's tearing apart
My blue, blue heart
[Verse 2: Ali Campbell]
I'd have 
sworn
, that with time
Thoughts of you would leave my head
I was wrong, now I find
Just one thing makes me forget
