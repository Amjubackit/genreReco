[Verse 1]
Pull the plug in September
I don't wanna die in June
I’d like to start planning my funeral
I've got work to do
Pull the plug, make it painless
I don't want a violent end
Don’t say that you'll always love me
'Cause you know I'd bleed myself dry for you
Over and over again
[Chorus]
Doomsday is close at hand
I'll book the marching band to play as you speak
I'll feel like throwin' up
You'll sit and stare like a goddamn machine
I’d like to plan out my part in this
But you’re such a narcissist
You'll probably do it next week
I don’t get a choice in the matter
Why would I? It's only the death of me
Only the death of me
[Verse 2]
Pull the plug, but be carеful
I don't wanna die too soon
I think there's good in you somеwhere
I’ll hang on 'til the chaos is through
