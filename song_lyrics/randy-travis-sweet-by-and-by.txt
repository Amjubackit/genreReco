[Verse 1]
There's a land that is fairer than day
And by faith we can see it afar
And the father waits over the way
To prepare us a dwelling place there
[Chorus]
In the sweet by and by
We shall meet on that beautiful shore
In the sweet by and by
We shall meet on that beautiful shore
[Verse 2]
To our bountiful father above
We will offer our tributes of praise
For the glorious gift of his love
And the blessing that hallow our days
[Chorus]
In the sweet by and by
We shall meet on that beautiful shore
In the sweet by and by
We shall meet on that beautiful shore
[Instrumental Bridge][Chorus]
In the sweet by and by
We shall meet on that beautiful shore
In the sweet by and by
We shall meet on that beautiful shore
[Outro]
We shall meet on that beautiful shore
