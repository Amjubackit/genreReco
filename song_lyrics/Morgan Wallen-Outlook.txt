[Verse 1]
I used to think that it was me against the world, but it wasn't
Thought drinkin' from a glass half empty made it better, but it doesn't
Funny all the things you realize
When that 20/20 hindsight vision opens up your eyes
[Chorus]
Now my outlook on life is different than it used to be
Yeah, my outlook is someone's up there
Lookin' down and lookin' out for me
[Verse 2]
Something in my ramblin' soul said I had to go toe to toe with the devil
Fell in love with a gypsy girl, said she couldn't risk it on a rebel
At least not one that doesn't have a cause
And I'll admit, I guess back thеn that's all I really was
[Chorus]
Now my outlook on life is differеnt than it used to be
Yeah, my outlook is someone's up there
Lookin' down and lookin' out for me
[Instrumental Break]
[Bridge]
There's so many crossroads you come to
And you can't put your finger on
Why you went the way you did, and then
