[Verse 1]
Oh, You are God, and we lift You up
Weʼll keep singing, Weʼll keep praising
We wonʼt stop, giving all we got
Cause You're worthy, Of all glory
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, there is no other
You are forever, Lord over all
There's nobody like You, no one beside You
[Chorus]
To You, let endless praise resound
Every night and day, and with no delay
Let endless praise resound, yeah
[Verse 2]
Boundless love, light before the sun
Your glory eternal
Never stops, giving all you got
Creation keeps singing
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, there is no other
You are forever, Lord over all (Lord over all)
There's nobody like You, no one beside You
[Chorus]
To You, let endless praise resound
Every night and day, and with no delay
Let endless praise resound
To You, let endless praise resound
Every night and day, and with no delay
Let endless praise resound
[Bridge]
We lift You up, up, up
Weʼre giving You our love, love, love
For everything Youʼve done, done, done
We give you all the praise
We lift You up, up, up
Weʼre giving You our love, love, love
For everything Youʼve done, done, done
We give you all the praise
[Instrumental]
[Chorus]
To You, let endless praise resound
Every night and day, and with no delay
Let endless praise resound
To You, let endless praise resound
Every night and day, and with no delay (Every night and day)
Let endless praise resound
[Outro]
To You
