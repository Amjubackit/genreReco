[Verse 1]
Someone said they left together
I ran out the door to get her
She was holding hands with Trevor
Not the greatest feeling ever
Said, "Pull yourself together
You should try your luck with Heather"
Then I heard they slept together
Oh, the less I know the better
The less I know the better
[Chorus]
Oh, my love
Can't you see yourself by my side?
No surprise
When you're on his shoulder like every night
Oh, my love
Can't you see that you're on my mind?
Don't suppose you could
Convince your lover to change his mind
So goodbye
[Verse 2]
She said, "It's not now or never
Wait ten years, we'll be together"
I said, "Better late than never
Just don't make me wait forever"
Don't make me wait forever
Don't make me wait forever
