[Chorus: Tom Misch]
I know that I need you now
The key that I won't forget
You're lost in Paris
(You're lost in Paris)
Lost in Paris
I hope that you're warm and safe
The memory I can't replace
You're lost in Paris
(You're lost in Paris)
[Verse 1: Tom Misch]
It was over in day
All the things I used to say
You've kept the same
All the places we would go
All the songs we got to know
You held it all
[Chorus: Tom Misch]
I know that I need you now
The key that I won't forget
You're lost in Paris
(You're lost in Paris)
I hope that you're warm and safe
The memory that I can't replace
You're lost in Paris
(You're lost in Paris)
