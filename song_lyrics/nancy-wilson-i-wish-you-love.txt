[Verse 1]
I wish you bluebirds in the spring
To give your heart a song to sing
And then a kiss, but more than this
I wish you love
And in July a lemonade
To cool you in some leafy glade
I wish you health, and more than wealth
I wish you love
[Bridge]
My breaking heart and I agree
That you and I could never be
So with my best, my very best, I set you free
[Verse 2]
I wish you shelter from the storm
A cozy fire to keep you warm
But most of all when snowflakes fall
I wish you love
[Bridge]
My breaking heart and I agree
That you and I could never be
So with my best, my very best, I set you free[Outro]
I wish you shelter from the storm
A cozy fire to keep you warm
But most of all when snowflakes fall
I wish you love
But most of all
I wish you love
