[Intro: James Fortune]
Blessings overflow, You've unchained my soul
I keep on thanking You
[Verse 1: James Fortune]
Favor
Chains were broken from my slaver
Favor (
Yeah, yeah
), Glory
The battles already won for me (
For me
), glory (
Ooh
)
Not by sight but by faith
Weapons may form against me (
Yeah, yeah
)
Your sacrifice sealed my fate
Ain't no chain my God can't break (
Nah-nah-nah-nah
)
[Chorus: James Fortune]
Blessings overflow, You've unchained my soul (
Ooh-ah
)
Whenever I feel lonely, that’s impossible (
Oh
)
When they drag me low, You cut loose my ropes (
Ah, yeah
)
It’s impossible to thank You for my overflow (
Ooh
)
[Post-Chorus: James Fortune]
(
La-la, la, la, la
) I keep on thanking You (
Ah, yeah
)
(
La-la, la, la, la
) You keep on coming through (
Ah, yеah, ooh
)
(
La-la, la, la, la
) I keep on thanking You
(
La-la, la, la, la
) You keep on coming through (
Ah, yeah, ooh
)
