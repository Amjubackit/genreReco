[Intro]
Take my breath away, like know you want to
Say you wanna play, 'cause I know I do
[Verse 1]
Are you everythin' I'm imaginin'
If we do it once, will we go again? Yeah
The colour of your energy is shinin'
Come take me out tonight, mm
[Pre-Chorus]
There's no reason why
Why would you wanna be alone?
'Cause I feel like I don't need to point out all the potential
You should know
[Chorus]
Take my breath away, like I know you want to
Say you wanna play, 'cause I know I do
All day, all day, all day
I've been thinkin' 'bout you
Come take you off my mind
[Verse 2]
Será que você é tudo que eu imaginei
Tudo que sonhei, tudo que pensei
Eu sei que nossa luz já tá brilhando
Come take me out tonight[Pre-Chorus]
There's no reason why
Why would you wanna be alone?
'Cause I feel like I don't need to point out all the potential
You should know
[Chorus]
Take my breath away, like I know you want to
Say you wanna play, 'cause I know I do
All day, all day, all day
I've been thinkin' 'bout you
Come take you off my mind
All day, all day, all day
O dia todo
All day, all day, all day
O dia inteiro
All day, all day, all day
O dia todo
Come take you off my mind
[Bridge]
Quero ter você aqui
Domeu lado bem assim
Quero você só pra mim
Quero ter você aqui
Hurry up and come to me
Countin' days, I'm losin' sleep
Want you right here next to me
Oh, baby, please
Bye[Pre-Chorus]
All day, all day, all day
O dia todo
All day, all day, all day
O dia inteiro
All day, all day, all day
O dia todo
Come take you off my mind
Boom, bye
[Chorus]
Take my breath away, like know you want to
Say you wanna play, 'cause I know do
All day, all day, all day
I've been thinkin' 'bout you
Come take you off my mind
All day, all day, all day
O dia todo
All day, all day, all day
O dia inteiro (Oh)
All day, all day, all day
O dia todo
Come take you off my mind
