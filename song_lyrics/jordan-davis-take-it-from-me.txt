[Verse 1]
I think me and you should blow this off
So much for the after-party
Let's tell everybody we got lost
I think me and you should do
Our own thing, our own way
At my place, why wait?
[Chorus]
Take it from me if you want a T-shirt to sleep in
It's my favorite, but you can keep it
It looks good, baby, you should leave it
Hangin' off your shoulder
Give me them bare feet dancin' down a hall and
Smilin' at me, runnin' your finger down the wall
You know what I want, I got what you need
Take it from me, yeah
[Verse 2]
Baby, you should stop right now, right here
Right where we wanna be
I'll spin you around and let's just see
Where this thing goes
All I know is that I'm all yours, all night
I've got nothin' but time
