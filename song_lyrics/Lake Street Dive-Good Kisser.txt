[Refrain]
If you're gonna tell them everything
Tell 'em I'm a good kisser
Tell 'em all the things you told me
In your desperate whisper
If you're gonna tell them everything
Don't leave out the good part
Tell 'em the way that you broke my heart
When you told me that you missed her
[Hook]
Tell 'em I'm a good kisser
Tell 'em I'm a good kisser
[Verse]
You know I'm not proud of the thing that we did
Didn't walk out, just the way that you wanted it
After it all, I stood up tall
I kept my mouth shut so you wouldn't fall
Now everybody's talking 'bout me
'Cause you would dirty me up just to get yourself clean
Get yourself clean
[Refrain]
If you're gonna tell them everything
Tell 'em I'm a good kisser
Tell 'em all the things you told me
In your desperate whisper
If you're gonna tell them everything
Don't leave out the good part
Tell 'em the way that you broke my heart
When you told me that you missed her
