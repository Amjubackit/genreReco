[Intro: Joshua Roberts]
You make me fucking sick and twisted
You're always taking shots, you missed me
Branded me with blood and lipstick
Can't get you off my tongue, thought we were fucking done
We're misfits
[Verse 1: Joshua Roberts]
You write it on the wall, the silence takes control
Your face just says it all, a death grip on my soul
I'm buried in the ground, a secret safe and sound
I'll never fit your role
[Pre-Chorus: Joshua Roberts]
Yeah, I'm about to lose it
And I just can't refuse it
And, girl, you got a screw loose, screw loose
Do you know that you're abusive?
[Chorus: Joshua Roberts]
You makе me fucking sick and twisted
You're always taking shots, you missеd me
Branded me with blood and lipstick
Can't get you off my tongue, thought we were fucking done
We're misfits
[Verse 2: Taylor Acorn]
Keep hearing your name and I wish I could forget it
You burned a hole in my head, and now I'm falling apart
You say you're sick of the cycle, but you're the one making it spin
Here we go again and again
[Pre-Chorus: Joshua Roberts & Taylor Acorn]
Yeah, I'm about to lose it
And I just can't refuse it
And, girl, you got a screw loose, screw loose
Do you know that you're abusive?
[Chorus: Joshua Roberts]
You make me fucking sick and twisted
You're always taking shots, you missed me
Branded me with blood and lipstick
Can't get you off my tongue, thought we were fucking done
You make me fucking sick and twisted
You're always taking shots, you missed me
Branded me with blood and lipstick
Can't get you off my tongue, thought we were fucking done
[Bridge: Joshua Roberts]
You make me fucking sick and twisted
You're always taking shots, you missed me
Branded me with blood and lipstick
Can't get you off my tongue, thought we were fucking done
We're misfits
[Outro: Joshua Roberts]
We're fucking misfits
We're misfits
