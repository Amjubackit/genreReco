[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
[Verse 1]
You was cruisin' with your top down, fourth of July
I was movin' down the block, we got caught at the light
Out my window, I was shootin' my shot
Watchin' fireworks in the sky
In the summers, we let the top down, soak up the light
All I wanted was just to lock down the love of my life
Nice and simple, like a midnight drive
Watchin' fireworks in the sky
[Chorus]
I'm callin' it now, I'm callin' it now, I'm callin' it now
You'll find love with me somehow, yeah, somehow
I'm callin' it now
[Verse 2]
We was movin' kinda fast, but the feelin' was right
We should cruise out to Nevada, get married tonight
Life is simple, 'long as you're in my life
Watchin' fireworks in the sky
In the summers, we spent the nights makin' love in the park
We was buzzin' off cherry wine, lookin' up at the stars
Soft and blissful, how you feel in my arms
Woke up, you were singin' this song like[Chorus]
I'm callin' it now, I'm callin' it now, I'm callin' it now
You'll find love with me somehow, yeah, somehow
I'm callin' it now
[Bridge]
Ooh-ooh
Every line, every word, every noun and verb can define you
Ooh-ooh
You were shy but you told me to pull over and now I'm right behind you
[Chorus]
I'm callin' it now, I'm callin' it now, I'm callin' it now
You'll find love with me somehow, yeah, somehow
I'm callin' it now
I'm callin' it now, I'm callin' it now, I'm callin' it now
You'll find love with me somehow, yeah, somehow
I'm callin' it now
[Outro]
Fire in the sky, yeah
Now I can see brighter days
Fire in the sky
Now I can see brighter days
Ooh, mate, that's fire
