[Verse 1: Tilian]
Lay my tentacles in the crucible
Just to see the world
As something beautiful again
Melt my sins
[Pre-Chorus: Jon Mess]
He’s losing pounds
Just lay him down
And pop it in its place
Take the scruff
And pull it up
He’ll die another day
[Chorus: Tilian]
Start over
I can't bear to look back
Start over
I always run away
Sweet closure
Cure me of my candors
Shoo, vultures
I'll die another day
[Verse 2: Tilian]
Lay my tentacles in the crucible
Just to see my chores
As something meaningful again
From within
All out of breath from my warpath
Sweating toxicity, begging for amnesty
Make it a song, always a song
Can only tell you the truth in the chant of a tone[Pre-Chorus: Jon Mess]
I'll never bе enough
Unless I finish this sentеnce
Did it come into existence
Or was it invented?
Only getting stuck because I already did it
[Chorus: Tilian]
Start over
I can't bear to look back
Start over
I always run away
Sweet closure
Cure me of my candors
Shoo, vultures
I'll die another day
[Breakdown: Jon Mess]
Pigeon in my vision
Frigid in the kitchen
Blithering committed
Piebald cow
Scummy ballerina
Standing on your femur
Pop your sloppy doggy
Eyeballs out
Started at the finish
Did it in a minute
Living and flip in the breeze
Had to do the did it
Rigid ribbit critic
Making a pinot go grig
God, why'd you have to do that to me?[Bridge: Tilian]
Safe, sound on the other side
Back to devour what I've been denied
Bad track record to be kind
But this time, I'll be paying attention
Can't dwell on my damaged pride
I got moves to make, I got hearts to break through
Manic and erratic, but emphatic about learning the hard way (Learning the hard way)
Need to bite the animal
To get my instincts churning
Shake up my camera roll
Been a minute, it's been a minute
We don't obey
It's all a game
There's no give and take
There's no give and take
There's no talk, but kill the king
No talk, just kill the king
They won't talk, just kill the...
[Outro: Jon Mess]
I'm shakin' the plastic off
Rippin' the wrapper off
Students coming out clean
Devoted to master stroke
Licking the envelope
Sending my bright blue flame
