[Verse 1]
It was always Amsterdam
Where we would put the distance to an end
We had a plan
Gonna lay it out on a queen sized bed
Catching up on twenty-one
Meet all your friends back home
That was not what it was, broke it off on the telephone
[Verse 2]
It was always absolute
Everybody said we were moving fast
Now I'm pretty over school
Switching out my books for the 
Eurail Pass
And all these dreams of Amsterdam
Where you'd surprise me with a yellow bike
With a basket that didn't match it
That I guess I'll never get to ridе
[Chorus]
Oh, oh, calling it a change of plans
Oh, oh, just a building on a postal stamp
Oh, oh, change of plans
[Verse 3]
Might have been a long shot
Bеtter that it's gone if it's gonna go
But, man, you kind of messed me up
'Cause I don't have a place to go back home
Is this just twenty-one and something's gotta give?
Well, I still got a bill for a ticket that I'm stuck with
