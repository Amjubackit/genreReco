[Intro]
One, two
[Verse 1]
All that I want
Is to wake up fine
Tell me that I'm alright
That I ain't gonna die
All that I want
Is a hole in the ground
You can tell me when it's alright
For me to come out
[Chorus]
Hard times
Gonna make you wonder why you even try
Hard times
Gonna take you down and laugh when you cry
These lives
And I still don't know how I even survive
Hard times, hard times
And I gotta get to rock bottom
 
(
Uh
)
[Verse 2]
Walking around
With my little rain cloud
Hangin' over my head
And it ain't coming down
Where do I go?
Give me some sort of sign
You hit me with lightning
Maybe I'll come alive
