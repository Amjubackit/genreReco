[Verse 1]
Fire in my lungs, I'm spun, walking on wire
In delirium, descending higher and higher
Can't live like this forever, running out of lifelines
Going hell for leather for just one last ride
[Pre-Chorus]
This gravity's pulling me down
It's time I got myself found
But just before I turn out the light
[Chorus]
Tonight, I ain't stopping for nothing
My devil is done
Into oblivion (Oblivion)
Yeah, I had it coming
Too close to the sun
Into oblivion (Oblivion)
[Verse 2]
Visions of the future, crystal in sight
My personal apocalypse finally arrived
Just a feather in bad weather, yeah, lost in the wild
Won't live like this forever, putting my world to rights
[Chorus]
Tonight, I ain't stopping for nothing
My devil is done
Into oblivion (Oblivion)
Yeah, I had it coming
Too close to the sun
Into oblivion (Oblivion)
