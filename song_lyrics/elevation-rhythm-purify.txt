[Verse: Elizabeth Rosa]
Wash me in Your blood, in the water of Your love
Only You can baptize me, hmmm
Bring me back to life, Holy Spirit Fire
Only You can baptize me, hmmm
[Chorus: Elizabeth Rosa]
You're enough for me, You're all I need
Purify me, only You can purify
You're enough for me, You're all I need
Purify me, only You can purify

Bring me back to life (Holy Spirit Fire)
Holy Spirit Fire
Only You can baptize me, oh
[Chorus: Elizabeth Rosa]
You're enough for me, You're all I need
Purify me, only You can purify
You'rе enough for me, You're all I need
Purify mе, only You can purify
