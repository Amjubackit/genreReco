[Verse 1]
I want to call you what's your number?
Do you want to meet me the day after?
I saw you look over your shoulder
I need to know now are you gonna come round?
I need to know now are you gonna come round?
[Chorus]
If you wanna come to my place then
We can talk about the weather
If you wanna come to my house then
You can meet my parents
If you wanna come to my bedroom
If you wanna come to my bedroom
[Verse 2]
I thought I saw you on the Leeds train
But you weren't there when I looked back again
I heard you're working in an office too
Maybe we could meet
Just tell me what you wanna do
[Chorus]
If you wanna come to my place then
We can talk about the weather
If you wanna come to my house then
You can meet my parents
If you wanna come to my bedroom
If you wanna come to my bedroom
If you wanna come to my place then
We can talk about the weather
If you wanna come to my house then
You can meet my parents
If you wanna come to my bedroom
If you wanna come to my bedroom[Bridge]
I know you've been feeling quite low lately
But I saw your car on the driveway
And I had to ask
[Chorus]
If you wanna come to my place then
We can talk about the weather
If you wanna come to my house then
You can meet my parents
If you wanna come to my bedroom
If you wanna come to my bedroom
[Outro]
If you wanna come to my
If you wanna come to my bedroom
If you wanna come to my bedroom
I can be there if you want to
If you wanna come to my bedroom
I can be there if you want to
