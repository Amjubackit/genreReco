[Verse 1]
Left my home long ago
To get out of California
The bird she hides, the other side
And I thought, I thought I saw her
Broken homes, rattled bones
White dust from before
Now I know what I've got
What I've got in store
[Pre-Chorus]
And I've seen future hiding beneath the water
And I've seen future and I cannot seem to wander
[Chorus]
And I know what I've got in store
There's no more white stallions at my door
See the stars up from the floor
And I see now
[Verse 2]
Cold nights, sunny skies
Just me, my hazy eyes
I've done it too, once with you
But where is my demise?
I've seen it all
In my ears, once before
It's my life, my job
But not my chore
[Pre-Chorus]
And I've seen future hiding beneath the water
And I've seen future but I cannot seem to wander
[Chorus]
I know what I've got in store
There's no more white stallions at my door, at my door
See the stars up from the floor
And I see now
I see now
[Instrumental Break]
[Outro]
I see now
I see now
I see now (oh, I see)
I see now
