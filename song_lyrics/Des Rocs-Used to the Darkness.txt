[Verse 1]
I've made mistakes, the Lord struck me down
Caught in a landslide, lost underground
I hear them gates, swing open loud
Come close to midnight, hell fade me down
[Pre-Chorus]
And then my eyes got used to the darkness
And everyone that I knew
Was lost and so long forgotten after you
[Chorus]
Now would you pray before you twist the knife?
Yeah, would you take my hand and take a life?
I'm too damn young to give up on the light
I'm used to the darkness, I'm used to the darkness
(Hey)
I'm just a man, I'm only flesh and bone
I can't bring it back on everything I've done
And now there's no one else left to love
I'm used to the darkness, I'm used to the darkness
(Hey)
[Verse 2]
Sweet smell of roses, have come at last
One fist of Earth fights, to come join the rest, rest, rest
