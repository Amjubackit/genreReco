[Intro]
Yeah, this shit right here sound like a love song
(she was in love)
A gangsta love song, you feel me? Check it out
(she was in love, with a THUG, in love!)
(she was in love, with a THUG, in love!)
[Verse 1]
Yeah, gangsta, uh-huh!
Have you ever had a pretty, young saditty
Black female with chips, from the city?
Her momma got ends, and her daddy got ends
And she liked to give me ends when I'm out with my friends
Good girl - why do good girls like bad boys? (I don't know)
When I was a kid, growin up, I never had toys
And I think that she can figure that shit out (why?)
Cause every time she came to pick a nigga up
Shit, she'd take a nigga out
Roll around town, ask the pound, they know, look
Baby was my thang, nah, she was my low-low
Bought my first Rol-o, and then we took a photo together
Man I hope this thang last forever
We been together six months, and we ain't argued yet
She lovin a nigga, steady buyin me shit
And don't say shit when I dip with my click
And understand, when I'm down and out
May need some help with some chips
Her mother approved of me, but her father he don't
He probably won't, shit Pops ain't no punk
Daddy's little girl be in a gangsta's world
Buyin me houseshoes and khaki blues, California curls
No matter what her father say, baby gon' see me
It's like a jungle sometimes, that makes me Wonder like Stevie
Believe me, when I say that baby was in love with a thug
In love with a thug
