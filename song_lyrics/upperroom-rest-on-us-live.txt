Spirit, come move over us
Come rest on us
Come rest on us
As the Spirit was moving over the waters
Spirit, come move over us
Come rest on us
Come rest on us
[Chorus]
Come down
Spirit, when You move, You make my heart pound
When You fill the room
You're here and I know You are moving
I'm here and I know You will fill me
Come down
Spirit, when You move, You make my heart pound
When You fill the room
You're here and I know You are moving
I'm here and I know You will fill me
[Post-Chorus]
We honor You, Holy Spirit
[Verse 2]
And fire and wind, come and do it again
Open up the gates, let Heaven on in
Come rest on us
Come rest on us
And fire and wind, come and do it again
Open up the gates, let Heaven on in
Come rest on us
Come rest on us[Chorus]
And come down
Spirit, when You move, You make my heart pound
When You fill the room
You're here and I know You are moving
I'm here and I know You will fill me
Come down
Spirit, when You move, You make my heart pound
When You fill the room
You're here and I know You are moving
I'm here and I know You will fill me
[Post-Chorus]
Oh, we wait, we wait

You said You would pour out Your Spirit
Just like in the upper room
Just like in the upper room
Just like in the upper room
Just like in the upper room
