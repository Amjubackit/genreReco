Did you say I had a lot to learn?
Well, don't think I'm trying not to learn
Since this is the perfect spot to learn
Trying to find somebody to teach me tonight
We'll start with the A B C of it
Then we'll roll down to the X Y Z of it
Help me solve the mystery of it
Oh, come on and teach me tonight
Well the sky's a blackboard (and I don't mean jungle) high above you
And if a shooting star goes by
I'll use that star to write I love you
A thousand times across the sky
One thing isn't very clear, my love
Should the teacher stand so near, my love?
Graduation's almost here, my love
Yeah, yeah teach me tonight
Well the sky's a blackboard, high above you
And if an astronaut zooms by
I'll reach and grab him real fast
Then write I love you a thousand times across the sky
One thing isn't very clear, my love
I know you're wondering how I switched that key, my love
Graduation's almost here, my love
Teach me
Teach me
Come on
And teach me tonight
