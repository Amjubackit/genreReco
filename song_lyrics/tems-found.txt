[Verse 1: Tems]
People always try to get involved
I feel like I'm dumb, I don't know where to run
People always trying to take a bite out of my mind
If you need a fight, maybe we could start
I feel I might just be coming undone
Tell me why you can't be found?
It's so unreasonable, I know you
Love is a difficult life
Maybe we should take it to the streets
[Pre-Chorus: Tems]
Basically, I might not be weak
Basically, I might not be falling
Basically, I might be used to this
[Chorus: Tems]
Ooh, I found myself, found myself, found
Ooh, I found myself, found myself, found
Oh, oh-oh, oh
[Verse 2: Brent Faiyaz, Tems, Both]
Before this gets out of hand
No more distance, let's just dance (Ooh, ooh-ooh)
I'll mind my mannеrs (I'll do)
Won't take advantage
Trust I can manage that
Can you picturе that? Yeah
I don't know who you been dealing with, but I–
Guarantee that you ain't been with this, because–
If you had you'll forget about the past
Before this gets out of hand (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
No more distance, let's just dance  (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
I'll mind my manners
Won't take advantage
Trust I can manage that (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Can you picture that?
[Pre-Chorus: Tems]
Basically, I might not be weak
Basically, I might not be falling
Basically, I might be used to this
[Chorus: Tems]
Ooh, I found myself, found myself, found
Ooh, I found myself, found myself, found
Oh, oh-oh, oh
[Outro: Tems]
Ee, ee-ee
