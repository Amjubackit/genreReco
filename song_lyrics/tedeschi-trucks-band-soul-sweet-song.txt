[Verse 1]
After the tears and the spate of lonely days
After the noon-born shadows slowly faded
After your heavy stone was rolled away
Rolling, rolling
That's when it finally came to me
[Chorus]
Now, there's no use wishing for your sweet return
'Cause I see you in the morning sun
And I hear you in the whispering wind
And I feel your rhythm moving me
'Cause your soul's sweet songs still singing
[Verse 2]
Isn't it a wonder how things change?
I was cryin' now, I'm laughing through the pouring rain
Everthing that's old is new again, oh that feeling
I can't help but hear the harmony
[Chorus]
Now, there's no use wishing for your sweet return
'Cause I see you in the morning sun
And I hear you in the whispering wind
And I feel your rhythm moving me
'Cause your soul's sweet songs still singing
[Chorus]
Now, there's no use wishing for your sweet return
'Cause I see you in the morning sun
And I hear you in the whispering wind
And I feel your rhythm moving me
'Cause your soul's sweet song's still singing
[Bridge]
In the memory of your melody
When the dawn breaks out, the birds all sing
And I feel your rhythm moving me
[Refrain]
'Cause your soul's sweet song's still singing
(I see you in the morning sun)
'Cause your soul's sweet song's still singing
(You up on the whispering wind)
Ans your soul's sweet song's still singing
(I feel you on moving wind)
And your soul's sweet song's still singing
