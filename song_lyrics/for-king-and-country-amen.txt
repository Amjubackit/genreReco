Count to three and say a prayer
Down for love and up for air
Underwater, overjoyed
Water for a thirsty soul
Water for a thirsty soul

Luke Smallbone

Baptize me into Your love (
No, no, oh-oh

Oh, my spiritâ€™s overcome (
No, no, oh-oh
)
Body, mind, and skin and bone (
Oh, oh
)
Love Him, gonna make it known
Love Him, gonna make it known
[Pre-Chorus: Luke & Joel Smallbone]
Yeah, I'm comin' alive with You
I'm comin' alive with You
I was livin' a lie 'til You
I'm comin' alive with You

Resurrection day is here  (
No, no, oh-oh
)
Bells are ringin' loud and clear  (
No, no, oh-oh
)
Caterpillar to a butterfly
  (
Oh, oh
)
Risen to another life
Risen to another life

You're in my blood, my veins
In every word I pray
You gave it all for me
I'll give it all for You
Oh, I'm in love with You
Overwhelmed by You
And if the world is listenin'
This is my confession
You are my obsession
(
You are my obsession
