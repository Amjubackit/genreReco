[Intro]
Closer to my dreams
It's coming over me
I'm getting higher
Closer to my dreams
I'm getting higher and higher
Feel it in my sleep
[Verse 1]
Sometimes it feels like I'll never go past here
Sometimes it feels like I'm stuck forever, ever
 (Like I'm stuck forever)
[Chorus]
But I'm going higher
Closer to my dreams
I'm going higher and higher
I can almost reach
[Verse 2]
Sometimes you just have to let it go (Let it go, let it go)
Leaving all my fears to burn and die
Push them all away so I can move on
Closer to my dreams
Feel it all over my being, in my being
Close your eyes and seek what you believe
