[Verse 1]
Soles on my shoes are worn, the knees on my jeans are torn
Sweat comin’ through my shirt, keep pushin’ even though it hurts
Chasing what I know is true, there’s nothing that I would not do
When everyone around me drops, I’m never gonna ever stop
[Pre-Chorus]
I won’t waste another minute
No, I won’t
[Chorus]
I’m a man on a mission
I’m a man on a mission
I don’t need no permission
I’m a man on a mission (Take it up now, take it up now)
I ain’t waiting and wishin’ (take it up now, take it up now)
Oh I got that ambition (take it up now, take it up)
I’m a man on a mission
[Verse 2]
When you look into my eyes, you know you gonna see that fire
If you’re standing in my way, it ain’t gonna be your day
Bleed until I own this dream, build it like you’ve never seen
Even at the mountain top, I’m never gonna ever stop
[Pre-Chorus]
I won’t wait another minute
No, I won’t[Chorus]
I’m a man on a mission
I’m a man on a mission
I don’t need no permission
I’m a man on a mission (Take it up now, take it up now)
I ain’t waiting and wishin’ (take it up now, take it up now)
Oh I got that ambition (take it up now, take it up)
I’m a man on a mission
[Bridge]
I won’t wait another minute, no I won’t
I won’t wait another minute, no I won’t
I won’t wait another minute, no I won’t (whoa)
I won’t wait another minute, no I won’t (whoa)
[Chorus]
I’m a man on a mission
I’m a man on a mission
I don’t need no permission
I’m a man on a mission (Take it up now, take it up now)
I ain’t waiting and wishin’ (take it up now, take it up now)
Oh I got that ambition (take it up now, take it up)
I’m a man on a mission
I’m a man on a mission
Take it up now, take it up
Take it up now, take it up
Take it up now, take it up
I’m a man on a mission[Outro]
Take it up now, take it up
Take it up now, take it up
Take it up now, take it up
I’m a man on a mission
