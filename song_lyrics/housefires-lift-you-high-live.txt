[Verse: Dante Bowe]
Come, let us sing to the Lord
Come, let us bow down before Him
His banner is love over us
And His mercies are new every morning
[Pre-Chorus: Dante Bowe]
And I'll sing oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
[Chorus: Dante Bowe]
So we lift You high
Forever lift You high
High within our hearts
High within our minds
Jesus, You alone
Our Rock,
 
our Cornerstone
High within our hearts
High within our minds

Yes, You are, God
So high, so high (So high)[Bridge: Kirby Kaple]
Oh, I won't let the rocks cry out in my place
 (Oh, no, no)
We return the breath You gave with our praise
 (Yeah, we do tonight, Jesus)
Oh, I won't let the rocks cry out in my place (No, no, no, no)
We return the breath You gave with our praise (Oh, oh, oh)
Oh, I won't let the rocks cry out in my place (No, no, no, no)
We return the breath You gave with our praise (Oh, I won't let)
Oh, I won't let the rocks cry out in my place (Oh, altogether, altogether)
We return the breath You gave with our praise (We return it)

Everything that's in me
