[Chorus]
Pushing past the limit, trippin' on hallucinogenics
My cigarette burnt my finger 'cause I forgot I lit it
[Verse 1]
Rippin' with my sinners 'cause fuck it, man, I ain't no beginner
And then I crawled back to the life that I said I wouldn't live in
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I just couldn't open up, I'm always shiftin'
Go find yourself a man who's strong and tall and Christian
[Chorus]
Pushing past the limit, trippin' on hallucinogenics
My cigarette burnt my finger 'cause I forgot I lit it
[Verse 2]
Drunken in Seattle, two more Xans and without a paddle
I don't remember your face or your hair or your name or your smile
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I just couldn't open up, I'm always shiftin'
Go find yourself a man who's strong and tall and Christian
[Chorus]
Pushing past the limit, trippin' on hallucinogenics
And then I crawled back to the life that I said I wouldn't live in
