[Verse 1]
Got me falling on my sword, but I don't resent you
Shaking to Deftones, glitter in my bones
Love you like I don't know better
[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, I wanna protect you, I do, oh
Your touch embroiders me
I'm wide open, hmm
[Chorus]
All yours, baby
Come down like a million tonnes
All yours, baby
Flood me with your nervous love
All yours, baby
Come down like a million tonnes
All yours, baby
[Verse 2]
Now I got my show clothes on, the clutch is sticking
Challenger dark blue, why do I trust you
When you tell me I'm a good thing?
[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, I wanna protect you, I do, oh
Your eyes destroying me
I'm wide open, hmm
