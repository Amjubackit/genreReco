[Chorus]
There is power in the name of Jesus
There is power in the name of Jesus
There is power in the name of Jesus
To break every chain, break every chain, break every chain
To break every chain, break every chain, break every chain
There is power in the name of Jesus
Oh there is power in the name of Jesus
There is power in the name of Jesus
To break every chain, break every chain, break every chain
Break every chain, to break every chain, break every chain
There is power in the name of Jesus
There is power in the name of Jesus
There is power in the name of Jesus
To break every chain, break every chain, break every chain
To break every chain, break every chain, break every chain
[Bridge 1]
There's an army rising up
There's an army rising up
There's an army rising up
To break every chain, break every chain, break every chain
To break every chain, break every chain, break every chain
[Chorus]
There is power in the name of Jesus
There is power in the name of Jesus
There is power in the name of Jesus
To break every chain, break every chain, break every chain
To break every chain, break every chain, break every chain
[Bridge 1]
There's an army rising up
There's an army rising up
There's an army rising up
To break every chain, break every chain, break every chain
To break every chain, break every chain, break every chain
[Interlude]
[Bridge 2]
I hear the chains falling
I hear the chains falling
I hear the chains falling
I hear the chains falling
I hear the chains falling
I hear the chains falling
I hear the chains falling
I hear the chains falling
[Interlude]
[Outro]
I hear the chains falling
I hear the chains falling
I hear the chains falling
I hear the chains falling
I hear the chains falling
I hear the chains falling
I hear the chains falling...
