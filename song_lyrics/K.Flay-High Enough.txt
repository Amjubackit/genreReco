[Intro]
(Oh, oh)
(Oh, oh)
[Verse 1]
I don't like anyone better than you, it's true
I'd crawl a mile in a desolate place with the snakes just for you
Oh, I'm an animal, hand me a tramadol, gimme the juice
You are my citadel, you are my wishing well, my baby blue
[Pre-Chorus]
I used to like liquor to get me inspired
But you look so beautiful, my new supplier
I used to like smoking to stop all the thinking
But I found a different buzz
The world is a curse, it'll kill if you let it
I know they got pills that can help you forget it
They bottle it, call it medicine
But I don't need drugs
[Chorus]
'Cause I'm already high enough
You got me, you got me good
I'm already high enough
I only, I only, I only got eyes for you
