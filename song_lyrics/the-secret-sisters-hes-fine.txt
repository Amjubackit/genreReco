[Chorus]
Davy White - where is he tonight?
He’s sleeping with her in a Tennessee town and he's fine
I think I lost my mind and my wasted time
I’m dreaming alone in a hotel bed that he's mine
[Verse 1]
Bought a gown to match his name
Kept my virtue just the same
So I could offer to my love
A bride he could be proud of
I was sure I held his heart
‘Til a Louisiana girl tore us apart
Watched him as he turned away
Into her arms, where he stayed
[Chorus]
Davy White - where is he tonight?
He’s sleeping with her in a Tennessee town and he's fine
I think I lost my mind and my wasted time
I’m dreaming alone in a hotel bed that he's mine
[Verse 2]
Once my tears had all run out
I learned how to live without
Pieces left behind in tow
I took to the hard road
Strangers know the songs I write
They come to hear me sing at night
They don’t know I’ve paid the cost
They don’t know what I lost[Chorus]
Davy White - where is he tonight?
He’s sleeping with her in a Tennessee town and he's fine
I think I lost my mind and my wasted time
I’m dreaming alone in a hotel bed that he's mine
[Bridge]
‘Til all the miles erase my pain
‘Til all the hurt is gone again
Searching for the next mistake
Who never ever would replace
[Chorus]
Davy White - where is he tonight?
He’s sleeping with her in a Tennessee town and he's fine
I think I lost my mind and my wasted time
I’m dreaming alone in a hotel bed that he's mine
[Outro]
I’m dreaming alone in a hotel bed that he's mine
But he’s sleeping with her in a Tennessee town and he's fine
