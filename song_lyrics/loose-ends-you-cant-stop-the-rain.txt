[Intro: Jane Eugene, 
Loose Ends
]
Ooh, ooh, ooh...oh yeah, yeah...
Yo-dum-dum-dum-da-dae-dum, yo-doe-dae
Yo-dum-dum-da-ho
Yo-dum-dum-dum-da-dae-dum, yo-doe-dae
[Verse 1: Jane Eugene]
Seems to me, a little bit of fantasy
Walkin' blind...
If I get some time, to search beyond
There's no bell to ring, oh
[Pre-Chorus: Jane Eugene]
There will come a day when the lightning will crash
And maybe then we'll see
Everything we've known all gone in a flash
Is this our destiny?
Oh-oh-oh...
[Chorus: Jane Eugene]
You can't stop the rain (You can't stop the rain)
When it starts to fall (When it starts to fall)
There's no one else to blame
(There's no one else to blame, yeah)
You can't lock that door[Verse 2: Carl McIntosh]
There comes a day when everyone will find
Who they are, oh yeah
So fight on hard
Don't ever stop, no no
It's your destiny, oh...
[Pre-Chorus: Jane Eugene]
There will come a day when the lightning will crash
Maybe then we'll see
Everything we've known all gone in a flash
Is this our destiny?
[Chorus: Jane Eugene]
You can't stop the rain (You can't stop the rain)
When it starts to fall (When it starts to fall)
There's no one else to blame (No one else to blame)
You can't lock that door
[Refrain: Loose Ends]
Yo-dum-dum-dum-da-dae-dum, yo-doe-dae
Yo-dum-dum-da-ho
Yo-dum-dum-dum-da-dae-dum, yo-doe-dae
Yo-dum-dum-dum-da-dae-dum, yo-doe-dae
Yo-dum-dum-da-ho
Yo-dum-dum-dum-da-dae-dum, yo-doe-dae[Chorus: Jane Eugene + 
Carl McIntosh
]
You can't stop the rain (You can't stop the rain)
When it starts to fall (When it starts to fall)
There's no one else to blame (There's no one else to blame)
You can't lock that door
[Outro: Jane Eugene + 
Carl McIntosh
]
Hang on now, no, no
You can't stop the rain (You can't stop the rain)
When it starts to fall
There's no one else to blame (There's no one else to blame)
You can't stop the rain
You can't stop the rain (
Oh
