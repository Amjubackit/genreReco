[Verse 1]
Well, everyone seems a damn genius lately
Tik-Tok talkin', late-night TV
There's still so much that I have yet to know
We get dressed up just to go downtown
In some ego-filled late-night crowd
Seems to be where I feel the most alone
[Verse 2]
I'd like to get lost on some old back road
Find a shade tree and a honey hole
And talk to my grandpa again
And I see God in everything
The trees and pain and nights in the spring
So why do I still long for a home?
[Verse 3]
I'd like to lay in a field on a cozy blanket
And feel the fear of never wakin'
To know thе true warmth of the sun
I'd like to lovе my lady long and hard
And lay down lines of laymen guitar
Never leave her lovin' arms again
[Verse 4]
My exes hate me and my friends all miss me
I wanna drown in rotgut whiskey
Leave this small town for a while
Head to Paris on a late-night flight
Find a bar and get in a fight
Write a few poems on a sunny balcony
