[Intro]
C'mon, c'mon
C'mon, c'mon
[Verse 1]
All those Saturdays when kids go out and play
Yo, I was up in my room, I let the stereo blaze
Wasn't faded, not jaded
Just a kid with a pad and pen and a big imagination
All this, I seek, I find
I push the envelope to the line
Make it, break it, take it
Until I'm overrated
[Chorus]
Click, click, boom
I'm comin' down on the stereo, hear me on the radio
Click, click, boom
I'm comin' down with a new style and you know it's buck wild
Click, click, boom
I'm on the radio station, tourin' 'round the nation
Leavin' the scene in devastation
[Post-Chorus]
I can see it in my mind
I can see it in their eyes
It's close enough to touch it now
Far away enough to die
