[Verse 1]
If I cut my hair, hope I grow it long
Back long, back time like way before
If I wear it straight, will they like me more?
Like those girls on front covers
Long hair make 'em stay little longer
Stay hair, stay straight, though we feel ashamed
By the curls, waves, and natural things
Curls, waves, and natural things
[Chorus]
Okay, one time, if I grow it long
Am I good enough? Am I good enough?
About time I embrace myself and soul
Time I feed my selfish soul
[Verse 2]
It's been so long since I had a sew in
With a frontal and some color
If I cut it all off, will it even grow?
Will it grow back real long?
Gotta prove them all wrong
[Chorus]
I don't want no struggles, I don't want no fears
I don't want no struggles, I don't want no fears
I don't want no struggles, I don't want noâ€”
Does it make sense to you why I cut it off?
Okay, one time, if I grow it long
Am I good enough? Am I good enough?
About time I embrace myself and soul
Time I feed my selfish soul
