[Verse 1]
Watchin' the walls in my head growin' higher
Weight of my thoughts got me too tired to climb
I'm screamin' for help as I suffer in silence
Knife at my neck and I'm numb to the violence
[Chorus]
'Cause I'm drowning
Head underwater, I'm alone
I'm drowning
Caught in the undertow (Caught in the undertow)
[Post-Chorus]
Go!
[Verse 2]
The clouds in my head always block out the sun
I keep having nightmares of not waking up
Will I stay in here for a lifetime?
Who is the one to decide (Who the fuck am I?)
[Chorus]
'Cause I'm drowning
Head underwater, I'm alonе
I'm drowning
Caught in the undertow
And it feels like I'm tryna find somеthing that was never even there
I'm drowning
Caught in the undertow (Caught in the undertow)
[Bridge]
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
I'm drowning (Head underwater, I'm alone)
I'm drowning (Caught in the undertow)
[Chorus]
And it feels like I'm tryna find something that was never even there
I'm drowning
Caught in the undertow
Caught in the undertow
[Outro]
I'm drowning in the undertow
