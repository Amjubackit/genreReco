[Verse 1]
Hey you
How's the world look from way up there?
I miss you
But I'm getting scared
[Pre-Chorus]
Because you used to be
Glued to me so perfectly
Filling all the in-betweens
Now there's nothing there
[Chorus]
How am I supposed to be
Yours when I can't see your face?
How am I supposed to not
Miss you with all of this space?
Because you say you'll meet me there someday
But how am I supposed to be close to you now?
From worlds away
[Drop]
From worlds away
From worlds away
[Verse 2]
Full moon
It's always when I feel it most
Can almost hear you say
That I'm not alone[Pre-Chorus]
Because we used to bе
Spinning out like Mercury
But now therе's no more ground beneath us
Anymore
[Chorus]
How am I supposed to be
Yours when I can't see your face?
How am I supposed to not
Miss you with all of this space?
Because you say you'll meet me there someday
But how am I supposed to be close to you now?
[Bridge]
It's cold tonight
Darling, are you cold tonight
I just wanna hold you tight
If you're really mine
'Cause I can keep
Shouting across the galaxies
But would you do that to me
If you're really mine?
[Drop]
From worlds away
It's cold tonight
Darling are you cold tonight
I just wanna hold you tight
If you're really mine
'Cause I can keep
Shouting across the galaxies
But would you do that to me
If you're really mine?[Outro]
It's cold tonight
Darling are you cold tonight
I just wanna hold you tight
If you're really mine
'Cause I can keep
Shouting across the galaxies
But would you do that to me
If you're really mine?
