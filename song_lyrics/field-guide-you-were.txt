[Verse 1]
"You were the one I wanted
Even if I didn't know it yet"
You told me sweetly
Your head on my chest
Then we did that weekly
Till it was all a mess
And you asked me sweetly
“Does it still make sense?”
I'm having a hard time keeping
This all in check
But I love you deeply
[Pre-Chorus]
You took my hand so gently
We fell in love accidentally
[Chorus]
I don't ever want to keep you waiting
You don't ever want to change my mind
I guess we're living in a love that's fading
We'll be dead by the summertime
If you ever want to start things over
If you ever want to try again
You can call me anytime of day, girl
Yeah, you still got a friend[Verse 2]
This wasn't what I wanted
But sometimes that's what you get
Yeah, it's all a whirlwind
The memories are all that's left
Sometimes I can't help but wonder
Do you have a new lover yet?
It's just the cost of living
And time spent
[Pre-Chorus]
You took my hand so gently
We fell in love accidentally
[Chorus]
I don't ever want to keep you waiting
And you don't ever want to change my mind
I guess we're living in a love that's fading
We'll be dead by the summertime
But if you ever want to start things over
If you ever want to try again
You can call me anytime of day, girl
Yeah, you still got a friend
