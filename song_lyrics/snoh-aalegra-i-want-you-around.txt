[Verse 1]
It's not that I don't want you here (Yeah, yeah)
It's somethin' 'bout the way you stare into my eyes
I know that I don't make things clear (No)
I fall for you every time I try to resist you
[Refrain]
We can get away
Palm trees, beach views
Ordinary day
All I wanna hear is 
Innervisions
 on replay
And sit right next to you, you
I try not to show how I feel about you
Thinkin' we should wait, but we don't really want to
I just wanna get away
And sit right next to you, you
[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna kiss you yet
I just wanna feel you
Feel you
[Chorus]
I want you around (
Around
)
Around
I want you around (
Around
)
Around (
'Round, 'round, 'round
)
I want you around
Around
I want you around
Around, around, 'round, 'round
