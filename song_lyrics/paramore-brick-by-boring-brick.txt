[Verse 1]
She lives in a fairy tale
Somewhere too far for us to find
Forgotten the taste and smell
Of a world that she's left behind
"It's all about the exposure
The lens,"
 I told her
The angles were all wrong, now
She's ripping wings off of butterflies
[Pre-Chorus]
Keep your feet on the ground
When your head's in the clouds
[Chorus]
Well, go get your shovel
And we'll dig a deep hole
To bury the castle
Bury the castle
Go get your shovel
And we'll dig a deep hole
To bury the castle
Bury the castle
[Post-Chorus]
Ba-da-ba, ba-da-ba-ba-da
