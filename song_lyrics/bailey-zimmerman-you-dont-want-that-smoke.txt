[Verse 1]
She's got the look
Damn right she owns it
She'll break your heart in this bar and she knows it
She'll ask you for a light
Keeps one in her pocket
She'll getcha' just enough to get you walkin'
Right outside, into the night
Watch the sparks fly from a Marlboro light
[Chorus]
But you don't want that smoke
The kind that's in her past
She'll love you till the filter
And leave you in the ash
Take it secondhand
From a fool who knows
You think you're just taking a drag
But you're playin' with a fire that'll burn you if you get too close
You don't want that smoke
[Verse 2]
Yeah she'll get you hooked
Might even call you "baby"
But she's a one way ticket that drops you off at crazy
Yeah she'll take your hand
Might even cloud your head
But if you breath her in
You'll be breathing out an SOS[Chorus]
And you don't want that smoke
The kind that's in her past
She'll love you till the filter
And leave you in the ash
Take it secondhand
From a fool who knows
You think you're just taking a drag
But you're playin' with a fire that'll burn you if you get too close
And you don't want that smoke
You don't want that smoke
Take it secondhand
I been her fool before
You think you're just taking a drag
But you're playin' with a fire that'll burn you if you get too close
[Outro]
She's got the look
And I've got the lighter
And I'm drunk enough to bum off of her tonight
Won't be the first
Won't be the last
You can judge me all you want
But you can't say that
You don't want that smoke
