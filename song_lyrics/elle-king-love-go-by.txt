[Verse 1]
Don't even tell me
'Cause I don't need to know about the others
Why you trippin', babe? We got each other
I don't want nobody but you
Another nosebleed
You don't gotta tell me what you're hidin'
I already know what you're like when you been drinkin'
I don't want nobody but you, baby
[Chorus]
Make me wanna cry sometimes
Make me wanna die sometimes
I won't let your love go by
Even though it hurts sometimes
We can be the worst sometimes
I won't let your love go by
[Verse 2]
You only call me
Whеn you're lonely and you're needin' somе attention
Baby, I can see through your intentions
I can't even say no to you
I can't speak
'Cause, babe, you know I'm guilty of the same shit
I do just what I want because you take it
At least I'm comin' home to you, baby (Coming home to you)
[Chorus]
Make me wanna cry sometimes
Make me wanna die sometimes
I won't let your love go by
Even though it hurts sometimes
We can be the worst sometimes
I won't let your love go by
[Bridge]
(Loving you) Cuts me deeper every time
(You) That's why I never get my hopes too high
(True) What they say about real life
Make you wanna scream, just bleed 'til you get it right
[Chorus]
Make me wanna cry sometimes
Make me wanna die sometimes
I won't let your love go by
Even though it hurts sometimes
We can be the worst sometimes
I won't let your love go by
Make me wanna cry sometimes
Make me wanna die sometimes
I won't let your love go by (Let your love go by)
Even though it hurts sometimes
We can be the worst sometimes
I won't let your love go by
[Outro]
Make me wanna cry sometimes
Make me wanna die sometimes
I won't let your love go by
