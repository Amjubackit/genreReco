[Intro]
Yeah
[Verse 1]
We should stay right here a little longer
Barely get to see each other
We can spend the weekend on the water
Even let you take me under
[Pre-Chorus]
Know you're usually
All work, no play
Glad you came
You should stay until
[Chorus]
Saturday
'Cause you ain't gotta work tomorrow anyway
Do you, babe?
Sweet Saturdays
I got you all to myself on Saturdays
Aw yeah, babe
Yeah
[Verse 2]
I can make you breakfast in the morning
Time well spent, it's way too overdue
Drinkin' like we know where this is going
Now, I'm gon' be all hungover you[Pre-Chorus]
We're both usually
All work, no play
Glad you came
Hope you stay until
[Chorus: Syd]
Saturday
'Cause you ain't gotta work tomorrow anyway
Do you, babe?
Oh, sweet Saturday
'Cause I got you all to myself on Saturdays
Aw yeah, babe
Yeah
