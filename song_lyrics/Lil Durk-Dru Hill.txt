[Chorus]
Show me what that love feel like
Show me something new
This shit got me traumatized
Show me what to do
My love undeniable
Tell me if it's true
I know that I'm fucked up, baby
So I know that it's not you
[Verse]
I'm embarrassed and I'ma admit it
If you married, you better get it
I'm a terrorist, I'm from the city
I got head in a Honda Civic
And I do drugs, but I'll admit it
But I had lied and said I quit it
Grab her ass and kiss her titties
When I confess, I feel uplifted
When she don't show me love, I get it
You know for sure you missed your period
In the past, you fucked with an idiot
And thеy ass ain't take you serious, I did
I can show you wherе I lay my head
Never let go 'til the end, that's what God said
Why you told me you did, but knowin' damn well you know you didn't?
Tryna get in my head to make me mad, I hate you bitches
I'm just playin', I don't know what I'm sayin', bae, I'm trippin'
When you mad, I still'll smack your ass and grab your nipples
When you sad, I'll hit you from the back, face in the pillow
I was mad, police pulled me over, had a Glock inside the rental
I ain't look in none of my mirrors, I was hangin' out the window
I ain't have it all for a lawyer, but you gave me what I give you
She got so mad I popped two pills
She so for real, she put on Dru Hill
She don't care how my crew feel
I'ma stay inside today, that's how my boo feel
