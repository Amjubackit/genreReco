[Verse 1]
I knew it from the start
Back when I met you
That you had my heart (You had my heart)
I knew it for sure
But my fear made me stop (Stop)
I didn't wanna regret you
And lead us to the dark (Like it happened before)
Like it happened before
[Verse 2]
I didn't wanna hide
But, girl, I was terrified (Ooh)
That my past defined
Who I was
And you would turn me down (Down)
Turn around and just walk right out (Walk right out)
'Fore I even had a chance
To show you my love (Love)
[Bridge]
Do I run
Run fast?
Do I stay
See what love's brought my way?
Ooh[Verse 3]
But now I'm looking back (I'm looking back)
And I'm not afraid of the past
'Cause I can see (All the darkness in me)
Darkness in me
Through it, I have grown
To recognize that in your eyes (In your eyes)
Is the basic truth (It's the truth)
You happened to me
[Outro]
You happened to me (Oh, girl)
You happened to me
You happened to me (Oh, yeah)
You happened to me
