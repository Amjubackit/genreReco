[Intro: Joyner Lucas]
I got some needs, I need the money like I need to breathe
I need the hundreds, a lot of
Tell that lil' bitch I'm out of her league
Out of her league
Yeah, Joyner
Joyner, Joyner, Joyner
[Verse 1: Joyner Lucas]
I got some needs, I need the money like I need to breathe
I needs some hundreds and I need to scheme
I need the W by any means, yadada
Yadada mean, tell that lil' bitch that I'm out of her league
Enough is enough and I think I'm allergic to suckers, you niggas keep makin' me sneeze
If thеm out for blood, then I'm makin' them bleed
You try to run and I'm breakin' your knees
I madе 'em fall like I'm rakin' the leaves
You know I ball like I play for the league
I mean what I say and I say what I mean
I ain't no joke, we ain't makin' no memes
If I pull up on 'em, I'm makin' a scene
Boom-boom-boom, then I'm makin' 'em scream
Straight from the bricks, I need a lick
I dreamed about it since I was a jit
Nigga, I'm lit, I cannot miss
Came from the bottom and got me a check
Bitch, I'm a threat, I gotta flex
You want the crown, but don't know what it takes
I am built different, I'm not what you think
I cannot lose, I'll go out with a bang
I hope you never say my name in vain
I'm with whatever, just not play no games
I know they say I changed, I cannot say the same
I bet they want me shackled and locked in the chains
I guess that's just what happens with bad news
On my mama, I've never been fragile
I'm the wrong one to fuck with, it's taboo
Turn you niggas to R.I.P. tattoos
Still a youngin but feel like a OG
Can't forget all the shit that they told me
Tired of niggas thinkin' that they know me
You gon' turn me back into the old me
You gon' turn me back into a savage
I done did shit you couldn't imagine
Leveled up and then bought me a mansion
I can never go back to a has-been[Chorus: Joyner Lucas]
I can never go back to the old days, no way
Back to walkin' to work on a cold day
Back to thinkin' my ex was my soulmate
Back to tellin' myself, "We'll be okay", we'll be okay
Was survivin' off 
ramen
 and 
OJ
Shorty payin' the bills, I had no say
I can never go back to the bottom, to the bottom
Sellin' drugs, never know when the cops come
Niggas jealous, they wanted to rob us
I was just trying to get me some dollars, a couple dollars
Turned my pennies from hundreds to commas
I'm so happy them days are behind us
[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
I ride by different spots, I get flashbacks
I can't get on your level, I'm past that
Watch me run that shit up, I can't go back to nothin', trying to get to the top of the world
My nigga went crazy, he walked in his condo and seen someone fuckin' his girl (Girl)
Fuck all that spinnin' blocks, that's that lil' boy shit, we catch him, we rockin' his world (Boom, boom, boom, boom)
I let everybody have they fun with me
Never had a woman say she done with me
I was workin', now I own the company
I keep money coming in constantly
My lil' brodie and them be having Runtz for cheap
Trying to get it, I've been on the run for weeks
I don't think none of you niggas could come for me
Both of my kids got it honestly
I'm the real deal
All the way, I don't half-step
Gotta do better than last year, that's my motto
Put a switch on the blick, fully auto
Put them thangs on the plane like I'm Ralo
Proud to say that I've finally changed up
Why the fuck they keep bringin' my name up? 'Cause I'm poppin'[Chorus: Lil Baby & 
Joyner Lucas

I can never go back to the old days, no way
Back to walkin' to work on a cold day
Back to thinkin' my ex was my soulmate
Back to tellin' myself, "We'll be okay", we'll be okay
Was survivin' off of ramen and OJ
I was payin' them bills, I had no say
I can never go back to the bottom
, to the bottom
Sellin' drugs, never know when the cops come
Niggas jealous, they wanted to rob us
I was just trying to get me some dollars, couple dollars
Turned my pennies from hundreds to commas
I'm so happy them days are behind us
[Outro: Joyner Lucas]
I'm so happy them days are behind me
I'm so happy the paper done found me
I done keep some good niggas around me
I got rid of them niggas who doubt me
Keepin' good energy and I'm prayed up
Tunnel vision, ain't nothing can phase us
Once you cross me, ain't nothing can save you
Pull that thing out, and fuck it, it's dangerous
Bitch, I'm dangerous
