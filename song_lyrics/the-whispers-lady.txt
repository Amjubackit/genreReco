You say you love me, lady
Girl, I hope you do
Only you can save me
My life equals you
Kiss me, drive me crazy
Would you do that for me, lady
You hear me?
(Lady) You say you want my babies
Girl, if that's a fact
(Lady) Then melt into me, lady, as though we were wax
Erase all my maybes
Would you do that for me, lady
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Your body's designed by the wisdom of time
And I couldn't live without you without losing my mind
You're the answer to my prayers and just like fresh air
You keep me alive
You cannot be spared
(Lady) I love you, oh, I love you
Said I love you, lady
(Lady) And no power on this earth to keep us apart
You're engraved in my heart
Do you hear me, pretty lady?
Want you to hear every word I'm saying, yeah, yeah(Organ solo)
Oh, whoa, whoa
Your body's designed by the wisdom of time
And I couldn't live without you, girl, without losing my mind
You're the answer to my prayers and just like fresh air
You keep me alive
You cannot be spared
Don't you ever go nowhere
(Lady) You see, I love you, lady
Really, really love you, lady
(Lady) And no power, no power on this earth can keep us apart
You're engraved in my heart
Do you hear me, pretty lady?
Do you hear me, baby?
(Lady) I want you to hear every word I'm saying, yeah, yeah
(Lady) Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo

Ga, ga, goo, wee, ga, goo, wee, ga, goo, wee, goo, wee, eee, eee, eee

(Lady) And that means that I'm gon' get you, baby
Well, well, well, well, well
Don't you know that I love you, girl
You kiss me and drive me crazy, yes you do, girl
(Lady) Kiss, hug, squeeze, love, do anything that you wanna do
(Lady) But don't you ever, ever, ever, ever go nowhere
