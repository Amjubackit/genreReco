[Intro]
(Tried to save myself but myself keeps slipping away)
(Tried to save myself but myself keeps slipping away)
(Tried to save myself but myself keeps slipping away)
(Tried to save myself but myself keeps slipping away)
[Verse 1]
Talking to myself all the way to the station
(Tried to save myself but myself keeps slipping away)
Pictures in my head of the final destination
(Tried to save myself but myself keeps slipping away)
All lined up, all the one's that aren't allowed to stay
(Tried to save myself but myself keeps slipping away)
Tried to save myself but myself keeps slipping away
[Refrain]
Ahh-ah, ah, ah
Oh, woah, oh, oh
Oh, woah, oh, oh
Ahh-ah, ah, ah
Oh, woah, oh, oh
Oh, woah, oh, oh
Ahh-ah, ah, ah
Oh, woah, oh, oh
[Verse 2]
Tried to save a place from the cuts and the scratches
Tried to overcome the complications and the catches
Nothing ever grows and the sun doesn't shine all day
Tried to save myself but myself keeps slipping away[Chorus]
Tried to save myself but myself keeps slipping away
Tried to save myself but myself keeps slipping away
Tried to save myself but myself keeps slipping away
Tried to save myself but myself keeps slipping away
[Chorus]
Ahh-ah, ah, ah
Oh, woah, oh, oh
Tried to save myself but myself keeps slipping away
Oh, woah, oh, oh
Tried to save myself but myself keeps slipping away
Oh, woah, oh, oh
Tried to save myself but myself keeps slipping away
Oh, woah, oh, oh
Tried to save myself but myself keeps slipping away
Oh, woah, oh, oh
Tried to save myself but myself keeps slipping away
Oh, woah, oh, oh
Tried to save myself but myself keeps slipping away
Oh, woah, oh, oh
Tried to save myself but myself keeps slipping away
Oh, woah, oh, oh
Tried to save myself but myself keeps slipping away
Oh, woah, oh, oh[Outro]
Tried to save myself but myself keeps slipping
