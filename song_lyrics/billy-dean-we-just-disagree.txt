I've been away
Haven't seen you in a while
How've you been
Have you changed your style
And do you think
That we've grown up differently
Don't seem the same
Seems you've lost your feel for me
So let's leave it alone
'Cause we can't see eye to eye
There ain't no good guy
There ain't no bad guy
There's only you and me
And we just disagree
I'm goin' back
To a place that's far away
How 'bout you
Have you got a place to stay
Why should I care
When I'm just trying to get along
We were friends
Now it's the end of our love song
So let's leave it alone
'Cause we can't see eye to eye
There ain't no good guy
There ain't no bad guy
There's only you and me
And we just disagree
So let's leave it alone
'Cause we can't see eye to eye
There ain't no good guy
There ain't no bad guy
There's only you and me
And we just disagree
So let's leave it alone
'Cause we can't see eye to eye
There ain't no good guy
There ain't no bad guy
There's only you and me
And we just disagree
