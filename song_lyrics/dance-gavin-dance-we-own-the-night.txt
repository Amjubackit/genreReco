[Intro: Tilian]
Forget my jealousy
You swallowed the demons on your own
There's nothing left for me
I keep thinking back to when you said
"We own the night"
[Chorus: Jon Mess & 
Tilian
]
Stomp that feeling, your puke is a mutant
Can't think of who did this, well, I grew stupid
Say accidents happen, it's admirable acting
Flicking the back of your ear with my finger 
(Night)
Separate is the way though, no, second is the place though
Just fake it through the day and the night is your God
See you in battle, your boat is my paddle
Your life is my business, your plaque on my wall
[Verse 1: Tilian]
Let your hair down, have one more round, drink 'til you believe it
Sloppy kisses, dirty wishes, baby, this is living
Roller coaster, up and down in random motion
Oh, come in closer, ditch your problems, better days are coming
Get up off the wall, come on, get down, get down
Give into the moment and live now, live now
Get up off the wall, come on, get down, get down
Give into the moment, feel it now
