[Verse 1]
You got a new life
Am I bothering you? Do you wanna talk?
We share the last line
Then we drink the wall till we wanna talk
[Pre-Chorus]
I go 'round and 'round
Satellite
[Chorus]
Spinnin' out, waitin' for ya to pull me in
I can see you're lonely down there
Don't you know that I am right here?
Spinnin' out, waitin' for ya to pull me in
I can see you're lonely down there
Don't you know that I am right here?
[Post-Chorus]
Spinnin' out, waitin' for ya
[Verse 2]
I'm in an L.A. mood
I don't wanna talk to you
She said, "Give me a day or two"
