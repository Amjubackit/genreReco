[Verse 1]
I don't really give a damn about the way you touch me when we're alone
You can hold my hand if no one's home
Do you like it when I'm away?
If I went and hurt my body, baby, would you love me the same?
I can feel all my bones coming back and I'm craving motion
Mama never really learned how to live by herself
It's a curse and it's growing
You're a pond and I'm an ocean, oh
All my emotions feel like explosions when you are around
And I've found a way to kill the sound, oh
[Chorus]
Oh, baby, I am a wreck when I'm without you
I need you here to stay
I broke all my bones that day I found you
Crying at the lake
Was it something I said to make you feel like you're a burden?
Oh, and if I could take it all back
I swear that I would pull you from the tide
[Verse 2]
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
I said no (I said no), I said no (I said no)
Listen close, it's a no
The wind is a-pounding on my back
And I've found hope in a heart attack
Oh, at last, it is past
Now I've got it, and you can't have it
