[Intro: Nelly Furtado & 
Timbaland
]
Am I throwin' you off?
Nope
Didn't think so
[Verse 1: Nelly Furtado & 
Timbaland
]
How you doin', young lady?
That feeling that you giving really drives me crazy
You're dope, have a player 'bout to choke
I was at a loss for words first time that we spoke
You lookin' for a girl that'll treat you right?
How you lookin' for her in the daytime with the light?
You
 might be the type if I play my cards right
I'll find out by the end of the night
You expect me to just let you hit it?
But will you still respect me if you get it?
All I can do is try, gimme one chance (
Chance
)
What's the problem? I don't see no ring on your hand
 (Hand)
I'll be the first to admit it
I'm curious about you, you seem so innocent
You wanna get in my world, get lost in it?
Boy, I'm tired of runnin', let's walk for a minute
[Chorus: Nelly Furtado & 
Timbaland
]
Promiscuous girl, wherever you are
I'm all alone, and it's you that I want
Promiscuous boy, you already know
That I'm all yours, what you waiting for?
Promiscuous girl, you're teasin' me
You know what I want, and I got what you need
Promiscuous boy, let's get to the point
'Cause we're on a roll, you ready?
