[Intro: Swizz Beatz]
It's a Friday, I'm 'bout to go off
Got my chains on and I'm 'bout to show off
DJ Snake up in here about to go off
Now go off, now go off
Goddamn!
[Verse 1: Jeremih, 
Swizz Beatz
]
Smoke stress to get rid of all the stress
On the run, nigga, gunnin' for the checks
These niggas don't know the half (
Show time!
)
These niggas don't know the half (
Show time!
)
See the hoes, see the clothes, see the cash (
Goddamn!
)
Gettin' high for the low, shit was bad
These niggas don't know the half (
Say what?
)
These niggas don't know the half (
Talk to 'em
)
Swear to God, these niggas don't know the half
[Chorus: Swiss Beatz, 
Jeremih
]
Rewind now!
Yeah, these niggas don't know the half
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Smoke stress to get rid of all the stress
[Verse 2: Jeremih]
Kill 'em off like I got a mask on it
Guillotine a Benz, you don't know the half of it
Whole squad winnin', you got small money
Don't need too many hands, I need all of it
You ain't ever been around, call me 2Pac
Pull up in my old hood in a new drop
On that kush, on that kush, blow a cloud of it
I'm the man, I'm the man, yeah I'm proud of it
Blowin' bands, got 'em jumpin' out the window
Shout out, shout out, pour some more and call it reload
Know I pull up, pull up on 'em like a free throw
Or go straight up, up the middle like I'm D. Rose
Treat your chick just like a whip and get another one
Wanna grab it, push it, smash and get another one
See my dogs on top, that's the math of it
Multiply the money up, no that's just half of it (
Talk to 'em!
)
