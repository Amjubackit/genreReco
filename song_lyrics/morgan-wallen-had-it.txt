[Verse 1]
Glass on the floor, tears in your eyes
Sheets in a mess, just a typical night
Slam that door, drink that wine
Find peace on the porch from the war inside
[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, we talk and we talk in circles and end up in between
The hell we're in right now and where we used to be
[Chorus]
You can't make it go how you planned it
You can't heal a heart with a bandage
And you sure as hell can't take back what you say
When you're drunk and you're speakin' your mind
Yeah, it's hurtin' me like it hurts you
But it's too late now likе a curfew
'Cause I can't give you back all thе time that I took
But I'll give you back the rest of your life
Did too much damage
Yeah, I knew what I had when I had it but, girl, I've had it
[Verse 2]
It's hard to say when to walk away but it's harder to stay when it's over
Tell me, baby, have I gone crazy?
'Cause I don't even feel like I know you[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, we talk and we talk in circles and end up in-between
The covers, now that's just trouble
'Cause that ain't where we're supposed to be, no
[Chorus]
You can't make it go how you planned it
You can't heal a heart with a bandage
And you sure as hell can't take back what you say
When you're drunk and you're speakin' your mind
Yeah, it's hurtin' me like it hurts you
But it's too late now like a curfew
'Cause I can't give you back all the time that I took
But I'll give you back the rest of your life
Did too much damage
Yeah, I knew what I had when I had it but, girl, I've had it
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
You can't make it go how you planned it
You can't heal a heart with a bandage
And you sure as hell can't take back what you say
When you're drunk and you're speakin' your mind
Yeah, it's hurtin' me like it hurts you
But it's too late now like a curfew
'Cause I can't give you back all the time that I took
But I'll give you back the rest of your life
Did too much damage
Yeah, I knew what I had when I had it but, girl, I've had it
Aw, girl, I've had it
