[Verse 1]
It's a mad, mad world
Tell me not to be so mad about it
It's a sad, sad world
Tell me that I'd ought to laugh about it
Funny thing is I'm the one with the cool head
Everything's fine if you pretend
Bless this mess, hallelujah
But I'm about to lose it (Two, three, four)
[Chorus]
Don't tell me to calm down, tell me to calm down
It's freaking me out that you're not freaking out
Don't tell me I'll be fine even if you're right
It's freaking me out, don't tell me to calm down
[Verse 2]
It's a mad, mad world, trying not to lose my shit about it (Calm down)
In a bad, bad mood, maybe I should take a hit about it (Calm down)
Every other day I need a hug like a teddy bear
Now the room's on fire, need to get some air
I'll bless this mess, hallelujah
Thoughts and prayers, so what? Who cares?
[Chorus]
Don't tell me to calm down, tell me to calm down
It's freaking me out that you're not freaking out
Don't tell me I'll be fine even if you're right
It's freaking me out, don't tell me to calm down[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Don't tell me, don't tell me to calm down
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Don't tell me, don't tell me to calm down
[Bridge]
Drifting through this fever dream in 
microplastic submarines
Your body is not yours, it seems
, what the fuck is happening?
[Chorus]
Don't tell me to calm down, tell me to calm down
It's freaking me out that you're not freaking out
Don't tell me I'll be fine even if you're right
It's freaking me out, don't tell me to calm down
[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Don't tell me, don't tell me to calm down
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Don't tell me, don't tell me to calm down
