[Verse 1]
Awaken my soul, come awake
To hunger, to seek, to thirst
Awaken first love, come awake
And do as You did, at first
[Chorus]
Spirit of the living God come fall afresh on me
Come awake me from my sleep
Blow through the caverns of my soul
Pour in me to overflow
[Verse 2]
Awaken my soul, come awake
To worship with all Your strength
[Chorus]
Spirit of the living God come fall afresh on me
Come awake me from my sleep
Blow through the caverns of my soul
Pour in me to overflow
[Bridge]
Come and fill this place
Let Your glory now invade
Spirit come and fill this place
Let Your glory now invade
[Chorus]
Spirit of the living God come fall afresh on me
Come awake me from my sleep
Blow through the caverns of my soul
Pour in me to overflow
To overflow
