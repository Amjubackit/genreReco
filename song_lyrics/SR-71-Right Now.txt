[Verse 1]
She clings to me like cellophane
Fake plastic submarine
Slowly driving me insane
But now that's over
So what if the sex was great
Just a temporary escape
Another thing I grew to hate
But now that's over
[Chorus]
Why, why do you always kick me when I'm high
Knock me down till we see eye to eye
Figured her out I know she
May not be Miss Right, she'll do right now
[Verse 2]
I used to hang on every word
Each lie was more absurd
Kept me so insecure
But now that's over
She taught me how to trust
And to believe in us
And then she taught me how to cuss
That bitch, it's over
You know I used to be such a nice boy
