[Verse 1]
I took my drugs and took my lovin' when I left out the spot
I left the party with a Barbie, marking X on the dot
She calls my phone up, but I told her, "I'm a loner" (Uh)
But she likes my watch and my droptop and my persona (Uh)
We hit the highway, one-five-five with my whole foot on the dash
She's in my ear, she's got no fear, she could care less if we crash
[Pre-Chorus]
But on my radar, I've got some nerve to play hard
I waited for my chance, but playboys, we don't dance, dance, dance
[Chorus]
I lost my heart (Uh)
Speedin' car, goin' ninety in the rain
Shе took my heart, filled it with nothin' but pain
This beat in my dancе is not for romance
I wanna stay, but playboys, we don't dance, dance, dance (I)
[Post-Chorus]
So I won't dance again (I), oh, baby
No, I won't dance again (That's why), oh, yeah (Uh)
No, I won't dance again (I)
No, I won't dance again
Pretty baby, ooh
