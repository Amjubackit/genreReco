[Chorus: Deuce & 
All
]
Undead!
You better get up out the way
Tomorrow we'll rise, so let's fight today
You know I don't give a fuck what you think or say
'Cause we're gonna rock this whole place anyway
Undead!
You better get up out the way
Tomorrow we'll rise, so let's fight today
You know I don't give a fuck what you think or say
'Cause we're gonna rock this whole place anyway
[Verse 1: Johnny 3 Tears]
Look up and see that motherfucking writing on the wall
When you see J3T thirty deep, he's down to brawl
Fuck the haters I see 'cause I hate that you breathe
I see you duck, you little punk, you little fucking disease
I got HU tatted on the front of my arms
The boulevard, brass knuckles in the back of the car
'Cause we drunk-drive Cadillacs, we never go far
But when you see us, motherfuckers, better know who we are
I got one thing to say to punk-asses who hate
Motherfuckers don't know, but you better watch what you say
From these industry fucks to these faggot-ass punks
You don't know what it takes to get this motherfucking drunk
I'm already loud, maybe it's a little too late
Johnny's taking heads off of all faggots who hate
'Cause I'm a God, motherfucker, there's a price to pay
Yeah, I'm a god, motherfucker, and it's Judgment Day
