[Verse 1]
I want to meet with you more than Sundays
I want to know more than just my mother's faith
'Cause that's not enough to get through the rough
Oh I need a Monday morning faith
I want to hear you in more than just one way
Show your voice in all of the mundane things
You're in the in between
You're in my everything
And that's all I really need
[Chorus]
My soul sings in the morning
I love the king and He loves me
All that I'm compelled to bring
Is my everyday offering
[Verse 2]
Let my worship be more than just singing
When did music become a religious thing
Let these songs be what thеy're meant to be
Thе sound of Your church awakening
Help my heart to keep up with the Heavens
Where the angels sing 24/7 praise
You're more than enough to get through my rough
You're teaching me Monday morning faith
And that's all I really need
