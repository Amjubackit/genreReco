[Intro]
Stay for tonight if you want to
I can show you what my dreams are made of
As I'm dreamin' of your face
I've been away for a long time
Such a long time, and I miss you there
I can't imagine bein' anywhere else
I can't imagine bein' anywhere else but here
(Oh, ooh)
[Verse 1]
How the hell did you ever pick me?
Honestly, I could sing you a song
But I don't think words can express your beauty
It's singing to me
How the hell did we end up like this?
You bring out the beast in me
I fell in love from the moment we kissed
Since then, we've been history
[Chorus]
They say that love is forever
Your forever is all that I need (It's all that I need)
Please stay as long as you need
Can't promise that things won't be broken
But I swear that I will never leave (I will never leave)
Please stay forever with me
