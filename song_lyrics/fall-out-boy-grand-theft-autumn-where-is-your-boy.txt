[Chorus]
Where is your boy tonight?
I hope he is a gentleman
Maybe he won't find out what I know
You were the last good thing about this part of town
[Verse 1]
When I wake up
I'm willing to take my chances on
The hope I'd forget that you hate him more than you notice
I wrote this for you (for you, soâ€¦)
[Pre-Chorus]
You need him, I could be him
I could be an accident, but I'm still trying
And that's more than I can say for him
[Chorus]
Where is your boy tonight?
I hope he is a gentleman
Maybe he won't find out what I know
You were the last good thing about this part of town
[Verse 2]
Someday I'll appreciate in value
Get off my ass and call you,
 
the meantime, I'll sport my
Brand new fashion of waking up with pants on
At four in the afternoon[Pre-Chorus]
You need him, I could be him
I could be an accident, but I'm still trying
And that's more than I can say for him
One, two, three, four!
[Chorus]
Where is your boy tonight?
I hope he is a gentleman
And maybe he won't find out what I know
You were the last good thing about this part of town
[Bridge]
(Won't find out) He won't find out
(Won't find out) He won't find out
[Chorus]
Where is your boy tonight?
I hope he is a gentleman
Maybe he won't find out what I know
You were the last good thing about this part of town
[Outro]
Where is your boy tonight?
I hope he is a gentleman
 (Won't find out)
Maybe he won't find out what I know
You were the last good thing about this part of town
