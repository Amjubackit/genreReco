[Chorus]
This is the blast off
Time to blow this up
So 'less you run for cover
We about to hit self-destruct
Got all my people with me
And none of us give a fuck
So put them hands up higher
Let's mess this party up
This is the blast off
Time to blow this up
So 'less you run for cover
We about to hit self-destruct
Got all my people with me
And none of us give a fuck
So put them hands up higher
Let's mess this party up
[Pre-Drop]
So put them hands up higher
So put them hands up higher
So put them hands up higher
Let's mess this party up
So put them hands up higher
So put them hands up higher
So put them hands up higher
Let's mess this party up
[Instrumental Drop]
[Chorus]
This is the blast off
Time to blow this up
So 'less you run for cover
We about to hit self-destruct
Got all my people with me
And none of us give a fuck
So put them hands up higher
Let's mess this party up
This is the blast off
Time to blow this up
So 'less you run for cover
We about to hit self-destruct
Got all my people with me
And none of us give a fuck
So put them hands up higher
Let's mess this party up
[Pre-Drop]
So put them hands up higher
So put them hands up higher
So put them hands up higher
Let's mess this party up
So put them hands up higher
So put them hands up higher
So put them hands up higher
Let's mess this party up
[Instrumental Drop]
