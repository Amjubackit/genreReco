[Verse 1: Luke Smallbone]
Got up on this high horse
But couldn't find a way back down
Tryna find a true north
But everything's the wrong way round
[Pre-Chorus: Luke & Joel Smallbone, 
Joel Smallbone
]
Busy breakin' down the walls
Just to build up fences
Try to see the other side
But no one's bending
We wait to shout and bare our souls
So we shout opinions
But nobody listens
[Chorus: Luke & Joel Smallbone]
For Heaven's sake, we're missin' hope
Been savin' face and throwin' stones, so
Take your mistakes, just let 'em go
'Cause don't we all wear those
Broken halos?
[Post-Chorus: Luke & Joel Smallbone]
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Broken halos[Verse 2: Joel Smallbone]
Untangle all the wires
Let's stretch out our dusty wings
Ooh, let's fly to the wild
And get a clear view of everything
[Pre-Chorus: Luke & Joel Smallbone, 
Joel Smallbone
]
See the Technicolor grace
Reachin' over mountains
Showin' there's another way
Another way
[Chorus: Luke & Joel Smallbone]
For Heaven's sake, we're missin' hope
Been savin' face and throwin' stones, so
Take your mistakes, just let 'em go
'Cause don't we all wear those
Broken halos?
[Post-Chorus: Luke & Joel Smallbone]
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Broken halos
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
[Bridge: Luke & Joel Smallbone]
You will rise, you will rise, you will find your strength
You can soar, you can soar on the eagle's wings
Don't you dare, don't you dare, don't you hang your head
Don't you hang your head[Chorus: Luke & Joel Smallbone, 
Joel Smallbone
 & 
Luke Smallbone
]
For Heaven's sake, we're missin' hope
Been savin' face and throwin' stones, so
Take your mistakes, just let 'em go
'Cause don't we all wear those (
Oh
)
For Heaven's sake (
For Heaven's sake
), we're missin' hope (
We're missin' hope
)
Been savin' face (
Been savin' face
) and throwin' stones, so
Take your mistakes (
Take your mistakes
), just let 'em go (
Just let them go
)
'Cause don't we all wear those
Broken halos?
[Post-Chorus: Luke & Joel Smallbone]
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Broken halos
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
[Outro: Luke & Joel Smallbone]
Broken halos
