[Verse 1]
If I go crazy
Don't save me
Well, baby
Just mix up a potion for two
[Chorus]
Don’t you wanna test my love?
Don't you wanna test my love?
Don't you?
Don’t you wanna rest, my love?
Don't you wanna rest, my love?
Don't you, love?
[Refrain]
Catch the wind, come with birds
Catchin' feelings, lost my words with you
Catch a flame, catch a night
Catch a feelin', catch a ride with you
[Verse 2]
Sippin' on midnight
It tastes like nostalgia
It tastes like a full-set gaze
Or Purple Haze with you
