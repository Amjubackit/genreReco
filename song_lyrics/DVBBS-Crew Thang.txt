[Chorus: Jeremih]
New Margiela, no shoestrings
Ten fingers but I got two rings
My girl look good but she act bad
What I call that? That's a mood swing
Gotta be the realest that you seein'
With a pocket full of 'em blue thangs
You and your friends, it's a crew thang
You and your friends, it's a crew thang
New Margiela, no shoestrings
Ten fingers but I got two rings
My girl look good but she act bad
What I call that? That's a mood swing
Gotta be the realest that you seein'
With a pocket full of 'em blue thangs
You and your friends, it's a crew thang
You and your friends, it's a crew thang
[Verse: SK8]
Yeah, just pulled up with your boo thang
Smoking OG with the d'usse
Yeah we goin' up on a Tuesday
Had to bite down make her toothache
Thotiana like a Blueface
She used to fuckin' with them goofys
I'm a real one, no bootleg
