[Verse 1]
Were you on the other line or driving in your car?
Were you hiding upstairs or playing your guitar?
Was there nothing ever wrong, 'cause you were always right?
Tell me, were you blindsided or were you just blind?
[Chorus]
And now you're saying that you're lost
And that's lost on me
Years of sitting across from me in therapy
I know the truth is hard to hear, but it wasn't hard to find
Baby, were you blindsided or were you just blind?
[Verse 2]
I'd go write a song, and you'd go for a walk
We had to get drunk to ever really talk
I told you what I needed, didn't have to rеad my mind
So, were you blindsided or wеre you just blind?
[Chorus]
And now you're saying that you're lost, and that's lost on me
You didn't ever wanna leave the house, I didn't want a family
I know the truth is hard to hear, but it wasn't hard to find
Baby, were you blindsided or were you just blind?
[Bridge]
Like that one time in 2019, before that big show, we had a big fight
I slept on the couch and then the next night you put on your suit
I put on a smile and sang about how it's okay to cry, dying inside
