[Chorus]
Did you ever love a woman with a death wish?
Something in her eyes, like flippin' off a light switch
Everybody dies, but you gotta find a reason to carry on
Oh, and did you ever catch her climbing on the rooftop?
Higher than a kite, dead of winter in a tank top
I don't wanna fight with you baby, but I won't leave you alone
[Verse 1]
The night was young once, we were the wild ones
Before we had to pay attention to the violence
Anything could happen, but nothing ever really did
I wanted action, shе wanted answers
Sunrise with thе dealers and the dancers
It takes a whole lot of medicine to feel like a little kid
[Chorus]
Oh, and did you ever love a woman with a death wish?
Something in her eyes, like flippin' off a light switch
Everybody dies, but you gotta find a reason to carry on
Oh, and did you ever catch her climbing on the rooftop?
Higher than a kite, dead of winter in a tank top
I don't wanna fight with you baby, but I won't leave you alone
[Verse 2]
Who's gonna save you, who's left to pray to?
What's the difference in a breakdown and a breakthrough?
I saw her in the moonlight diggin' up the garden bed
I wanna hold her until it's over
Let her sleep through the mornin' on my shoulder
But there's nothing I can say to her that I ain't already said
[Chorus]
Did you ever love a woman with a death wish?
Something in her eyes, like flippin' off a light switch
Everybody dies, but you gotta find a reason to carry on
Oh, and did you ever catch her climbing on the rooftop?
Higher than a kite, dead of winter in a tank top
I don't wanna fight with you baby, but I won't leave you alone
[Bridge]
When your words mean nothin'
When the world turns to monochrome
And you know she's not bluffin'
'Cause you feel it in your bones
You feel it in your bones
[Chorus]
Oh, and did you ever love a woman with a death wish?
Something in her eyes, like flippin' off a light switch
Everybody dies, but you gotta find a reason to carry on
Oh, and did you ever catch her climbing on the rooftop?
Higher than a kite, dead of winter in a tank top
I don't wanna fight with you baby, but I won't leave you alone
[Outro]
I wanna hold her until it's over
I wanna hold her until it's over
Oh, I wanna hold her until it's over
I wanna hold her
I wanna hold her
I wanna hold her until it's over
I wanna hold her until it's over
Oh, I wanna hold her until it's over
