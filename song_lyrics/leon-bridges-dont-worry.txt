[Verse 1: Leon Bridges]
We've been runnin' 'round, covered in gas, playin' with matches, oh
We've been runnin' this thing, runnin' it down, down
Sweetly talkin', but you and I both know
Keep on runnin' it down, a world that we ignored
"I don't have much, but I give you love"
I used to say that kind of stuff
Like a broken clock, stopped givin' you time
Now you're takin' your love to another guy (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Tell me what he gon' do, what he gon' do
How he gon' make sweet love to you (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
And mm, if he hurts you know
I'll be runnin' him down, runnin' him down (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
[Chorus: Ink]
Don't worry 'bout, don't worry 'bout me
Don't worry 'bout, don't worry 'bout me
[Verse 2: Leon Bridges]
Been a few months since I called your phone
I ain't mad, but I'm movin' on
Yeah, I got a new little thing in fact
Nothin' wrong, it's in the past
[Chorus: Leon Bridges & Ink]
Don't worry 'bout, don't worry 'bout me
Don't worry 'bout, don't worry 'bout me[Verse 3: Leon Bridges]
Shut you out, you know I tried
Said I got over you, but I lied
Morning love and morning fights
I miss it all (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Said you went down to Corpus
I miss you in the doorway (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Stayin' up all night
Silly, silly me
[Bridge: Ink]
No, it wasn't just one time
Baby, I've been living with your lies too long
Callin' past midnight
Having to pick you up on my way home
I don't mind if you get a little wild
I just ask that you be there for me
'Cause you had been slippin' for awhile
And I needed to find someone to give me what I need
[Chorus: Leon Bridges, 
Ink
, 
Leon Bridges & Ink

Don't worry 'bout, don't worry 'bout me (
No, don't you worry 'bout me
)
Don't worry 'bout me
Don't worry 'bout, 
don't worry 'bout me
[Post-Chorus: Ink]
I've been runnin' from myself
But there's something different this time
Every other night
You got my mind runnin' wild[Instrumental Break]
[Bridge: Ink, 
Leon Bridges
]
Take me on a show ride (
Park the car and stay inside
)
Can't forget your kisses, sweet (
Remember how your body be
)
Always wore the perfect fit (
I know how you like it
)
Sip it down like moonshine (
Hold you in the moonlight
)
No one sees me like you, babe (
Let your tears rolls down my face
)
I don't wanna go back (
Girl, don't do him like that
)
Okay, then I have to leave
[Chorus: Leon Bridges & Ink]
Don't worry 'bout me (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Don't worry 'bout, don't worry 'bout me (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Don't worry 'bout, don't worry 'bout me (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Don't worry 'bout, don't worry 'bout me (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Don't worry 'bout, don't worry 'bout me (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
