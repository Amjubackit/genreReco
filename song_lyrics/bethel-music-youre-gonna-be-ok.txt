VERSE 1
I know it’s all you’ve got to just be strong
And it’s a fight just to keep it together, together
I know you think that you are too far gone
But hope is never lost, hope is never lost
PRE CHORUS 1
Hold on, don’t let go
Hey, hold on, don’t let go
CHORUS
Just take one step closer
Put one foot in front of the other
You’ll get through this
Just follow the light in the darkness
You’re gonna be ok
TAG
You’re gonna be ok
VERSE 2
I know your heart is heavy from those nights
But just remember that you are a fighter, a fighter
You never know just what tomorrow holds
And you’re stronger than you know
Oh, you’re stronger than you know
PRE CHORUS 2
Hold on, don’t let go
Hey, hold on, and don’t let go
BRIDGE
When the night is closing in
Don’t give up and don’t give in
This won’t last, it’s not the end
It’s not the end
You’re gonna be ok
SPONTANEOUS
You’re not alone, never alone
And you’re gonna be ok
