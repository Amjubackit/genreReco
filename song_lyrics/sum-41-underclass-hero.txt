[Intro]
One, two, three, four...
[Verse 1]
Well, I won't be caught living in a dead-end job
While praying to my government, guns, and God
Now it's us against them, we're here to represent
And spit right in the face of the establishment
[Pre-Chorus]
And now I don't believe (in having faith in nothing)
Stand on my own (and got no sympathy)
Wasting the youth (while being young and useless)
Speak for yourself (and don't pray for me)
[Chorus]
Well, because we're doing fine, and we don't need to be told
That we're doing fine, 'cause we won't give you control
And we don't need anything from you, 'cause we'll
Be just fine, and we won't be bought and sold, just like you
[Post-Chorus]
A call across the Underclass!
[Verse 2]
Calling out loud with no respect
I'm not the one
, I'm just another reject
I'm the voice to offend all those who pretend
Unsung 
against the grain
, I'm here to 
rise against[Pre-Chorus]
Now I'm desensitized (I state my place in nowhere)
Burning the flag (of the degeneration)
Everyone sing (the anthem of no future)
Down with the mass ('cause we're not listening)
[Chorus]
Well, because we're doing fine, and we don't need to be told
That we're doing fine, 'cause we won't give you control
And we don't need anything from you, 'cause we'll
Be just fine, and we won't be bought and sold, just like you
[Post-Chorus]
May I have your attention please?
I pledge allegiance to the Underclass as your hero at large!
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge]
One, two, three, four...
We're the saints of degeneration
We don't owe anyone an explanation
Fuck elitists, we don't need this
We're the elite of just alright
[Chorus]
Well, because we're doing fine, and we don't need to be told
That we're doing fine, 'cause we won't give you control
And we don't need anything from you, 'cause we'll
Be just fine, and we won't be bought and sold, just like you
