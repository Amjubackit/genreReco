[Verse 1]
It makes any difference
I still love you, girl
You're my weakness
You changed my world
[Chorus]
Share my life
Trust in me
You're all I want
Everything I need, ooh, baby
[Verse 2]
Makes any difference
I give you all my heart
Girl, my sun sets
Anywhere you are
Maybe I'm a dreamer
You're still my queen
Your love's like a river, girl
It's runnin' right through me
[Chorus]
Share my life, hey girl (Share my life)
You can trust in me, baby (Trust in me, girl)
You're all I want, hey, girl (You're all I want)
You're everything I need, hey, baby
