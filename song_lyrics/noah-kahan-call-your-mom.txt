[Verse 1]
Oh, you're spiraling again
The moment right before it ends
You're most afraid of
But, don't you cancel any plans
'Cause I won't let you get the chance to never make them
[Pre-Chorus]
Stayed on the line with you the entire night
'Til you let it out and let it in
[Chorus]
Don't let this darkness fool you
All lights turned off can be turned on
I'll drive, I'll drive all night
I'll call your mom
Oh, dear, don't be discouraged
I've been exactly where you are
I'll drive, I'll drive all night
I'll call your mom
I'll call your mom
[Verse 2]
Waiting room, no placе to stand
His greatest fears and wringing hands and thе loudest silence
If you could see yourself like this
If you could see yourself like this, you'd have never tried it
