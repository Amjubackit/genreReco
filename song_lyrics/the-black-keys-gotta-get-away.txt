[Verse 1]
I got paid, then I was on the road in a heartbeat
Mama said, Mama said you got a one track mind
But you ain't gonna get it all the time
She wasn't lyin'
[Chorus]
I went from San Berdoo to Kalamazoo
Just to get away from you
I searched far and wide hoping I was wrong
But maybe all the good women are gone
[Verse 2]
My last dime, got used up on gasoline
Know what I mean, what I mean
Atlanta, GA by the end of the day, no other way
That's what I say
[Chorus]
I went from San Berdoo to Kalamazoo
Just to get away from you
I searched far and wide hoping I was wrong
But maybe all the good women are gone
[Bridge]
And everything I had to say
Wish we'd gone so far away
Well, now I can't stay
[Verse 3]
Blacktop, I can't stop for no one
It's no fun, no fun
With a one track mind if you don't get lucky sometimes
But still I'm tryin'
[Chorus]
I went from San Berdoo to Kalamazoo
Just to get away from you
I searched far and wide, hoping I was wrong
But maybe all the good women are gone
[Chorus]
I went from San Berdoo to Kalamazoo
Just to get away from you
I searched far and wide, hoping I was wrong
But maybe all the good women are gone
