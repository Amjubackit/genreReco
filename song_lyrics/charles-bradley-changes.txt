[Verse 1]
I feel unhappy
I feel so sad
I have lost the best friend
That I ever had
She was my woman
I loved her so
But it’s too late now
I’ve let her go
[Chorus]
I’m going through changes
I’m going through changes
In my life
Ooh
Oh, baby
Oh, now, now
[Verse 2]
We shared the years
We shared each day
In love together
We found a way
But soon, the world
Had its evil way
My heart was blinded
Love went astray
[Chorus]
I’m going through changes
I’m going through changes
Oh, in my life
Owwwww! Uhhhhh
Whoa
OH! Ooh, ooh
[Verse 3]
It took so long
To realize
I can still hear
Her last goodbyes
And now all my days
Are filled with tears
Wish I could go back
And change these years
[Chorus]
I’m going through changes
I’m going through changes
AHHHH!
Oh, it hurts so bad
Mmm
In my life, in my life
It’s gotta be a change
In my life
Ohhhh
These little changes
In my life
It hurts so bad
Somebody gotta help me
To these changes
