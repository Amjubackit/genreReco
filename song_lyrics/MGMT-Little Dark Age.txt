[Verse 1]
Breathing in the dark, lying on its side
The ruins of the dead painted with a scar
And the more I straighten out, the less it wants to try
The feelings start to rot one wink at a time
[Chorus 1]
Oh-oh
Forgiving who you are for what you stand to gain
Just know that if you hide, it doesn't go away
When you get out of bed, don't end up stranded
Horrified with each stone
On the stage,
 
my little dark age
[Verse 2]
Picking through the cards, knowing what's nearby
The carvings on the face say they find it hard
And the engine's failed again, all limits of disguise
The humor's not the same, coming from denial
[Chorus 2]
Oh-oh
I grieve in stereo, the stereo sounds strange
I know that if you hide, it doesn't go away
If you get out of bed and find me standing
All alone, open-eyed
Burn the page,
 
my little dark age
