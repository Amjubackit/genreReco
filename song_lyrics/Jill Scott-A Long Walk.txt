[Verse 1]
You're here, I'm pleased, I really dig your company
Your style, your smile, your peace mentality
Lord, have mercy on me, I was blind, now I can see
What a king's supposed to be; baby, I feel free
Come on and go with me
[Refrain]
Let's take a long walk around the park after dark
Find a spot for us to spark
Conversation
, verbal elation, stimulation
Share our situation, temptation, education, relaxation
Elevation, 
maybe we can talk about Surah 31:18
[Verse 2]
Your background, it ain't squeaky clean, shit
Sometimes we all got to swim upstream
You ain't no saint, we all a sinner
But you put your good foot down and make your soul the winner
I respect that; man, you're so phat; and you're all that,plus supreme
Then you're humble; man, I'm numb with your feeling
I can feel everything that you bring
[Refrain]
Let's take a long walk around the park after dark
Find a spot for us to spark
Conversation, verbal elation, stimulation
Share our situations, temptation, education, relaxation
Elevation, maybe we can talk about Revelations 3:17
