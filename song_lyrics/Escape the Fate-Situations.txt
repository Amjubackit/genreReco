[Intro]
The situations are irrelevant now
She loves the way that I tease
I love the way that she breathes
[Verse 1]
I touched her ooh, she touched my ahhh
, it was the craziest thing
I love the girls who hate to love because they're just like me
A certain girl she took my hand and ran it up her thigh
She licked her lips and pulled my hair, 
I fall in love for a night
[Pre-Chorus]
She can't behave and I'm just a slave
Donâ€™t worry I'll be gone when the morning comes
[Chorus]
Darling what is going on?
Honestly that never happened
Lying is your favorite passion
Leave me, go where you belong
Higher heels and lipstick napkins
Dying is your latest fashion
[Verse 2]
The frustration it's a regular thing
I hate the ones who love to hate because they're just like me
A certain girl she took her hand and put it in my lap
"It's way too full," she said
"Once you have me you'll always come back."
