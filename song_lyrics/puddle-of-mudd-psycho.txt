[Intro]
Maybe I'm the one
Maybe I'm the one who is the schizophrenic psycho (Yeah)
Maybe I'm the one
Maybe I'm the one who is the schizophrenic psycho
[Verse 1]
She lays down on the fresh lawn
She can make everything magical
But she tied one on big time
And it makes me wanna rewind
To back in the days when we were young
When everything was like a loaded gun
Ready to go off at any minute
And you know we're gonna win again
Yeah, you know we're gonna win again
Yeah, you know we're gonna win again
[Chorus]
Maybe I'm the one
Maybe I'm the one who is the schizophrenic psycho (Yeah)
Maybe I'm the one
Maybe I'm the one who is the paranoid freak (Oh yeah)
[Verse 2]
She lays down on the sidewalk
Never very analytical
She is something simply beautiful
Re-appear when you feel magical
To back in the days when we were young
When everything was like a loaded gun
Ready to go off at any minute
Yeah, you know we're gonna win again
[Chorus]
Maybe I'm the one
Maybe I'm the one who is the schizophrenic psycho (Yeah)
Maybe I'm the one
Maybe I'm the one who is the paranoid freak
[Bridge]
I'm the one
I'm the one who is the schizophrenic psycho
I'm the one
I'm the one who is the schizophrenic psycho
I'm the one
I'm the one who is the schizophrenic psycho
[Pre-Chorus]
Back in the days when we were young
When everything was like a loaded gun
Ready to go off at any minute
And you know we're gonna win again
[Chorus]
Maybe I'm the one
Maybe I'm the one who is the schizophrenic psycho (Yeah)
Maybe I'm the one
Maybe I'm the one who is the paranoid freak
[Outro]
I'm the one
I'm the one who is the schizophrenic psycho
I'm the one
I'm the one who is the schizophrenic psycho
I'm the one
I'm the one who is the schizophrenic psycho
