[Verse 1]
I remember all them summers
Playing 'til my fingers bled
You'd sing the songs and I'd sing with you
And we'd get drunk and go to bed
Looking back on all them memories
Lord, I hate to sleep alone
But if you ever get the notion
That you need me, let me know
[Chorus]
'Cause it's just two hours to get there, babe
I can make it back about an hour or so
Hold you close against my skin
Need a little warmth on a night so cold
Singing songs you used to sing
Even if it was a little out of tune
Hotter than the socks on a jersey giant
Lord, I thought you hung the moon
[Verse 2]
I remembеr all them winters
Drinking Woodford 'til we drownеd
And we'd get word there was a party
Bundle up and go to town
I miss those nights of reckless glory
And I'd come back if you'd just call
[Chorus]
'Cause it's just two hours to get there, babe
I can make it back about an hour or so
Hold you close against my skin
Need a little warmth on a night so cold
Singing songs we used to sing
Even if it was a little out of tune
Hotter than the socks on a jersey giant
Lord, I thought you hung the moon
[Bridge]
I left town when we were over
'Cause it did not feel the same
Every backroad had a memory
And every memory held your name
[Chorus]
'Cause it's just two hours to get there, babe
I can make it back about an hour or so
Hold you close against my skin
Need a little warmth on a night so cold
Singing songs we used to sing
That one about the lady in the long black veil
Should have seen the warning signs
Lord, I love to hear you wail
High and lonesome, hard and strong
Even if it was a little out of tune
Hotter than the socks on a jersey giant
Lord, I thought you hung the moon
