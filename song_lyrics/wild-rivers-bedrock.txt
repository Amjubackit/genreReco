[Verse 1]
I got this friend I like to carry on my shoulders
He looks a lot like me
I sorta hoped we'd grow apart as we got older
But he's getting awful heavy
[Pre-Chorus]
Look at that sky
Covered in gold
I can't tell with my face to the ground
Takin' a lap
Trying to get my back
Will I end up just drivin' around?
[Chorus]
I can't keep crawling back
I'm out of the red and
Down to the bedrock
I can't keep crawling back
I'm out of my head and
Down to the bedrock
[Verse 2]
I keep this secret to myself
'Cause I'm a soldier
I got both feet in the ground
Tryin' to leave this bed is just like lifting up a boulder
And I don't wanna talk right now
[Pre-Chorus]
Look at that sky
Covered in gold
I can't tell with my face to the ground
Headin' out west
Catching my breath
Will I end up just drivin' around?
[Chorus]
I can't keep crawling back
I'm out of the red and
Down to the bedrock
I can't keep crawling back
I'm out of my head and
Down to the bedrock
Down to the bedrock
Down to the bedrock
[Bridge]
I can't keep crawling
I can't keep crawling back
I'm down
I can't keep crawling back
I can't keep crawling back
[Chorus]
I can't keep crawling back
I'm out
I can't keep crawling down to the bedrock
I can't keep crawling back
I can't keep crawling down to the bedrock
I can't keep crawling back
I can't keep crawling down to the bedrock
I can't keep crawling back
I can't keep crawling, crawling
I'm down
