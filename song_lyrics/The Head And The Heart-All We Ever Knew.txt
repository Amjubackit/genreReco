[Intro]
When I wake up in the morning
I see nothing
For miles and miles and miles
When I sleep in the evening, oh lord
There she goes, only in dreams
She's only in dreams
[Verse 1]
Well, well my love
We've been here before
Don't drag me through this again
We tried everything under the sun
[Pre-Chorus]
Now I'm trying to wake up from this
I'm trying to make up for it
[Chorus]
All we ever do is all we ever knew
La la la la la la
La la la la la la
La la la la la
La la la la la la
La la la la la la
La la la la la
