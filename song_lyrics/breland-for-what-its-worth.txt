[Intro]
Mm
[Verse 1]
Bad habits, my second chances
Always turn into three and four
Late nights, all them back-and-forth fights
Finally turn into heartbreak war
I admit that I was immature and I was insecure
I took advantage for granted havin' my hand in yours
I don't know if I should say this, but I can't make it worse
Baby, you can take this
[Chorus]
For what it's worth, I hope that you're happy now
And that you found what you didn't in me
For what it's worth, I'd trade everything I have
For what I had, I know that talk is cheap
But for what it's worth, I done did some growin' up
I ain't out there gettin' drunk, I can be what you deserve
'Cause now I see your heart, your mind, your every curve
And your love for what it's worth
[Verse 2]
God honest, I never wanted
To be a mеmory that you wish you never made
Wish you nеver left, you were right, I guess
When you said we were better off this way
'Cause now you got me lookin' in the mirror and not just in the rear
I know that I can't make this right, but let me make it clear
Girl, there's nothin' I can say that you ain't already heard
Baby, you can take this[Chorus]
For what it's worth, I hope that you're happy now
And that you found what you didn't in me
For what it's worth, I'd trade everything I have
For what I had, I know that talk is cheap
But for what it's worth, I done did some growin' up
I ain't out there gettin' drunk, I can be what you deserve
'Cause now I see your heart, your mind, your every curve
And your love for what it's worth
[Chorus]
For what it's worth, I hope that you're happy now
And that you found what you didn't in me
For what it's worth, I'd trade everything I have
For what I had, I know that talk is cheap
But for what it's worth, I done did some growin' up
I ain't out there gettin' drunk, I can be what you deserve
'Cause now I see your heart, your mind, your every curve
And your love for what it's worth, oh
For what it's worth, oh
