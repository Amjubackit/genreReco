[Verse 1]
I'm standing at your door
My heart is calling yours
Come fall into my arms
You're weary from it all
Been running for too long
I'm here to bring you home
[Chorus]
I'm reaching out, I'll chase you down
I dare you to believe how much I love you now
Don't be afraid, I am your strength
We'll be walking on the water, dancing on the waves
[Verse 2]
Look up and lift your eyes
The future's open wide
I have great plans for you, oh, yes, I do
Your past is dead and gone
Your healing has begun
I'm making all things new, watch me do it
[Chorus]
I'm reaching out, yes, I am, I'll chase you down
I dare you to believe how much I love you now, ohh
Don't be afraid, I am your strength
We'll be walking on the water, dancing on the waves
[Interlude]
Can you see us dancing?
I'll turn your sorrow into shouting
I'll turn your fear into faith, on the waves
Come on let's go
[Bridge]
I set every star into place
So you would remember my name
I made it all for you
You are my masterpiece
You are the reason I sing
This is my song for you
Every star in the sky
I set every star into place
So you would remember my name, ohh
I made it all for you
You are my masterpiece
You are the reason I sing, yeah
This is my song for you
[Chorus]
I'm reaching out, oh, I'll chase you down
Come on I dare you just believe
Won't you believe that I love you? I really love you
Don't be afraid, know that I am your strength
You can trust me
We're walking on the water, dancing on the waves
Oh watch us
Walking on the water, dancing on the waves, mm
