[Verse 1]
All messed up with nowhere to go
I stare at myself in the mirror alone
It's hard to make friends when you're half in the
 
grave
But I ain't dead yet
And I've got something to say
Oh, oh, oh, yeah
[Chorus]
You got holes in your clothes
And booze on your breath
You look like hell
And you smell like death
Oh, oh, oh
[Verse 2]
There's a stranger in my eyes again
I swear to God I don't know him
You're tired of me
I'm tired of you
So turn around and leave me to myself
Oh, oh, oh, yeah
[Chorus]
You got holes in your clothes
And booze on your breath
You look like hell
And you smell like death
Oh, oh, oh
