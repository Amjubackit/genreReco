[Intro]
Every little thing-ing-ing
[Verse 1]
Your favour waits within the future
My dreams are small compared to Yours
Why should I worry 'bout tomorrow when I know
That all I gotta do is trust You, Lord
[Chorus]
Every little thing is gonna be alright
Every little thing is gonna be just fine
Whether I can see it now
I know You will work it out for good
Every little thing, everything will be alright
[Interlude]
[Verse 2]
Behind the scenes and in the details
You plan the perfect way for me
Why would I dwell upon the road's uncertainties
When all I gotta do is look to You
Yeah all I gotta do is look to You
[Chorus]
Every little thing's gonna be alright
Every little thing's gonna be just fine
Whether I can see it now
I know You will work it out for good
Every little thing, everything will be alright[Interlude]
Every little thing, every little thing
Every little thing, everything will be alright
Every little thing, every little thing
Every little thing, every little thing
[Chorus 2]
Whether I can see it now
I know You will work it out for good
Every little thing, everything will be alright
[Interlude]
Every little thing, every little thing
Every little thing, everything will be alright
