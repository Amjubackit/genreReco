[Verse 1]
Shadow, take me down
Shadow, take me down with you
For the last time, for the last time
For the last time, for the last time
[Verse 2]
You're in the water, I'm standing on the shore
Still thinking that I hear your voice
Can you hear me, can you hear me?
Can you hear me, can you hear me?
[Chorus]
For the last time, for the last time
For the last time, for the last time
[Verse 3]
At night I'm driving in your car
Pretending that we'll leave this town
We're watching all the street lights fade
And now you're just a stranger's dream
I took your picture from the frame
And now you're nothing like you seem
Your shadow fell like last night's rain
[Chorus]
For the last time, for the last time
For the last time, for the last time
