[Verse 1]
Mama's grippin' on her hip on the fifth of May
In a photo Daddy took on a humid day
In a town that's anyone's guess
Way out in western Kentucky
She's broken-hearted as he's ridin' away
On a motorbike out to East LA
To find a white line, it's such a fine line
Between broken and lucky
[Chorus]
Gettin' high's easy, gettin' drunk's fine
It's the gettin' by that'll get a soul down
So if you need me, know that I'm bleedin'
Somewhere alone in some coastal town
Some coastal town
[Verse 2]
And I can feel when your body ain't in this bed
I can still hear you laughin' last spring in my head
Now it's April and I hate you and I'm headin' home
The little notеs that you left for me
In coat pockets and cabinеtry
Are in a shoe box from when we once talked
Back when I felt free
