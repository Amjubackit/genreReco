[Intro]
You saved me, You saved me
Now I will never leave Your love, oh, sing it again, "You saved"
And You saved me, You saved me
Now I will never leave Your love, yeah, you saved me
And You saved me, You saved me
Now I will never leave Your love, yeah, sing, "I'm in love"
[Chorus]
'Cause I'm in love
I cannot remember what I was doing before I met You
I've been captivated
By the love that saved me
And I'm in love
I cannot remember what I was doing before I met You
I've been captivated
By love that saved me, You saved me
[Post-Chorus]
And You saved me, You saved me
Now I will never leave Your love
This is why we thank You, this is why we thank You
You saved me
And You saved me, You saved me
Now I will never leave Your love
This is why we thank You, this is why we thank You
You saved me
And You saved me, You saved me
Now I will never leave Your love, sing it again, "You saved me"
And You saved me, You saved me
Now I will never leave Your love, yeah, I'm in love
