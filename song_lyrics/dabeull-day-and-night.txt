[Refrain]
I feel like, loving you tonight
What I feel for you, makes me feel alright, feel alright, oh
[Verse]
That boy is sweet like a warm summer weather
I can't help thinking 'bout when we're together
[Chorus]
Day and night (Ooh)
I say day and night, day and night
[Verse 2]
There ain't no darkness tonight
Baby your love will shine, day and night
Day and night, Oh
[Chorus]
Day and night (Ooh)
I say day and night, day and night
Day and night (Ooh)
I say day and night, day and night
[Refrain]
I feel like, loving you tonight
What I feel for you, makes me feel alright, feel alright, oh[Bridge]
One of a kind
You ease my mind
That is so fine
Got me feeling good
One of a kind
You ease my mind
That is so fine
Got me feeling good
[Chorus]
Day and night (Ooh)
I say day and night, day and night
Day and night (Ooh)
I say day and night, day and night
