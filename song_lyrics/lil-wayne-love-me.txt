[Pre-Chorus: Future]
I'm on that good kush and alcohol
 
(
Mike WiLL Made-It
)
I got some down bitches I can call (What's hatnin'?)
I don't know what I would do without y'all
I'ma ball 'til the day I fall (I'ma ball, ball, ball)
[Chorus: Drake & 
Future
]
Yeah, long as my bitches love me (
Yeah, yeah; yeah, yeah
)
I can give a fuck 'bout no hater
Long as my bitches love me (
Yeah, yeah; yeah, yeah; yeah, yeah
)
Yeah, I can give a fuck 'bout no nigga
Long as these bitches love me
[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Uh, pussy-ass nigga, stop hatin'
Lil Tunechi got that fire
And these hoes love me like Satan, man
Yeah, fuck with me and get bodied
And all she eat is dick
She's on a strict diet, that's my baby
With no makeup, she a ten
And she the best with that head
Even better than Karrine
She don't want money
She want the time that we could spend
She said, "'Cause I really need somebody
So tell me you're that somebody"
Girl, I fuck who I want, and fuck who I don't
Got that A1 credit, that's that filet mignon
She said, "I never want to make you mad
I just want to make you proud"
I said, "Baby, just make me cum
Then don't make a sound"
