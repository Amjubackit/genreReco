[Verse 1]
I want to get so close to you
And cherish the sunshine, leave everything behind
And run away so far together
A lot of pain in those eyes, please don't lose your light
[Chorus]
Shine, shine your light, yeah
This world was made for you, so do what you have to do
I wanna see you shine, shine your light, yeah
This world was made for you, so do what you have to do
[Verse 2]
Yes, it's been a long time, I know
But patience will be kind, 'cause God is on your side
Marvellous, marvellous child, I know anger
It's like a thorn that's stuck inside, but you will heal in time
[Chorus]
Shine, shine your light, yeah
This world was made for you, so do what you have to do
I wanna see you shine (
Shine
), shine your light, yeah
This world was made for you, so do what you have to do
[Bridge]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Shine your light)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Shine, shine your light)
I wanna see you shine (
Shine
), shine your light, yeah
This world was made for you, so do what you have to do
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh) Shine (
Shine
), shine your light, yeah
This world was made for you, so do what you have to do[Instrumental Outro]
