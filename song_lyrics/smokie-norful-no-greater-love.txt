For God so loved the world
That He gave His only begotten Son
The Son gave His life for me
When He died on Calvary
There is no greater love
No love nowhere, no greater love;
Than a man would lay down His life for a friend
No love nowhere, I've searched all over
There is no greater love
There is no greater love
There is no greater love
No greater love
No greater love
Than a man would lay down His life for a friend
No greater love
No greater love
No greater love
No greater love
No greater love
No greater love
No greater love
No greater love
Jesus went to Calvary
To save a wrench
Like you and me;
That's love, that's love
They hung Him wide
They stretched Him wide
He hung His head, and then He died;
That's love, that's love
That's not how the story ends
Three days later He rose again;
That's love, that's love
