Driving
In a cold sweat
There is no one
On an icy highway
Northbound
To Alaska
Hypothermic
Where the sun can't find me
Pistol
In the glove box
With a shot left
Incase they come for
Answers
To the questions
Only I know
What it is they're after
Gas up
With a credit card
And an alias
That I learned this morning
Dead flies
â€˜round the heat lamp
No receipt please
Hide face from the cameraPeel out
On a snowbank
But I land it
And I'm back on the highway
Northbound
To Alaska
Hypothermic
Where the sun can't find me
I can see them
I can hear them
I can feel them
Speeding up behind in an
Unmarked
Hallucination
In a wilderness
Where the law can't hear me
Shouting
Begging mercy
On the concrete
While they kick my jaw in
Driving
In a cold sweat
There is no one
On this icy highway
