[Intro]
All of the time (You gotta be)
All of the time (You needed me)
All of the time (You gotta be)
All of the time
[Verse 1]
You never know when I’m feeling low
Never talk, you’re laying low
Better off, I’m beaming up
(It’s all alright, it’s all alright)
[Pre-Chorus]
Heaven ain’t big enough
It’s evident, I guess it’s true
You never did what you had to do
(And if you want, I’ll come back and meet you there)
[Chorus]
All of the time (Keep telling me)
All of the time (You needed me)
All of the time (Keep telling me)
(It’s all alright, it’s all alright)
[Verse 2]
Why don’t we talk in the morning?
Want you to need me, my love
Could it be easy for us?
(It’s all alright)
