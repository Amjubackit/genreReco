[Intro: Kirk Franklin]
This is for that little child with no father
For that man that doesn't have a place to stay
For that little boy living with AIDS
[R. Kelly] Can I tell you a story, tell you a story
[Kirk] You can lean on me
[Verse 1: R. Kelly]
There's a man
Standing on the corner
He has no home
He has no food
And his blue skies are gone
Can't you hear him cryin' out
[Verse 2: Crystal Lewis]
And there's a girl
Searching for a father and a friend
Praying that the storm someday will end
But instead of walking away
Open up your heart and say
[Hook: Choir]
I, am here
You don't have to worry
I can see, your tears
I'll be there in a hurry when you call
[Choir] Friends are there to catch you when you fall
[Choir] Here's my shoulder, you can lean on me[Verse 3: Mary J. Blige]
Oh, there's a child
Who is sick and begging to be free
But there is no cure for his disease
He looks up to his mother and
[Verse 4: Choir/Bono/Kirk Franklin]
[Choir] As she holds, his hand
[Bono] Praying that someday
The sun will shine again
[Kirk] And the pain?
[Choir] And the pain, will end
[Kirk] Pain will end (come on)
[Chorus] (with Mary J. Blige ad-libs)
[Bridge:]
[R. Kelly] Tell me, how can I, how can I love Jesus
When I've never seen His face?
[Bono] Yeah, I see you dying
[Crystal Lewis] And I turn and walk away
[Crystal] So hold my hand
[Bono] Let me take you to a friend of mine
[Dalon Collins] He's waiting just to ease your troubled mind
[Kirk] Yeah, yeah, He loves you more than you'll ever know
[Bono] 'Stead of walking away
[Kirk] Open up
[Crystal Lewis] Open up your heart and say
[Kirk] Come on[Hook: R. Kelly, Kirk Franklin, Tamila Mann, Dalon Collins ad-libs]
