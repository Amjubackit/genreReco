[Verse 1]
Ayy, don't mess this up, they can have my money
Come too far to rely on punting
Set me up for a life of honey
Milk and, yeah, hide it in that building
Trust a lot, that'll get us killing
All of the get-rich want my shillings
Trick the cop, he is not our villain
Get to the top, put the rock on ceiling
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't-don't, don't move one time
That's the van, that's the man with the gun
Don't-don't, don't move one time
That's the man that's gon' stop the one
We-we-we rob the bank
If they catch us, they throw us away
We-we-we rob the bank
If they catch us, they throw us away
[Chorus]
I need it in a coffin (What you need?)
I need it in a safe (What you need?)
I need it in a novel (What you need?)
I need it in a lake (What you need?)
I need it in a coffin (What you need?)
I need it in a safe (What you need?)
I need it in a novel (What you need?)
I need it in a lake (What you need?)
