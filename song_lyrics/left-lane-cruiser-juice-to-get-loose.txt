Well gimme whiskey when I get high
Gimme Shine all the time
Gimme Bordeaux when I gotta get low
Gimme Miller Lite when I gotta make it right
Well get that Kronenbourg you down in the dirt
Get that Stella Artois gotta walk it off
Get that 1664 cuz you know they gonna want us to play some more
Well get that Sun King make my head ring
Get that Dark Horse got the powerful force
Well better get on down to the Mad Anthony cuz you know that's where it all began for me
