[Verse 1]
Oh, it's been a few years of learning
Just how I should go on with myself
Late night, with my hands up against the mirror
Wishing that I could be someone else
[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, I hit a little stormy weather
And ooh it feels good to get out the rain
[Chorus]
Oh, don't want to live like that
Oh, 'cause I'm healing
Yeah, 'cause I'm healing
It's gonna feel good again
Don't want to live like that
Oh, 'cause I'm healing
Yeah, 'cause I'm healing
It's gonna feel good again
[Verse 2]
Lately I feel like I've turned a corner
Waiting for my train to come pulling in
Tethered to a brand new sense of m–µaning
Proud to fill the shoes I've been standing in
