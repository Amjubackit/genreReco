[Verse 1]
The wonder of the world is gone, I know for sure
All the wonder that I want, I found in her
As the whole becomes a part I strike to burn
And no flame returns
[Verse 2]
Every intuition fails to find its way
One more table turned around, I'm back again
Finding I'm more lost than found when she's not around
When she's not around
I feel it coming down
[Chorus]
Give me what I could never ask for
Connect me and you could be my chemical now
Give me the drug you know I'm after
Connect me and you could be my chemical
[Bridge]
When everybody wants you (My chemical goes slow)
When everybody wants you (My chemical goes so slow and)
Everybody wants you (So slow and)
Everybody wants your soul
[Chorus]
Give me what I could never ask for
Connect me and you could be my chemical now
Give me the drug you know I'm after
Connect me and you could be the chemical[Outro]
You could be the chemical
You could be the chemical
You could be the chemical
You could be the chemical
