[Verse 1]
I've got so much to thank God for
So many wonderful blessings
And so many open doors
A brand new mercy
Along with each new day
That's why I praise You
And for this I give You praise
[Chorus]
For waking me up this morning
(That's why I praise You)
For sending me on my way
(That's why I praise You)
For letting me the dawn of a brand new day
(That's why I praise You)
For brand new mercies
(That's why I praise You)
You give to me each day
That's why I praise You and for this
[Bridge]
For every mountain You brought me over
For every trial you've seen me through
For every blessing
Hallelujah, for this I give You praise
You brought me over safely
Lord I thank You
(For every trial you've seen me through)
Hallelujah, for this I give You praise
Lord, You're Jehovah Nissi
(That's why I praise You)
Lord, You provide for me
So many times, ooh
(That's why I praise You)
So many times, I need You
(That's why I praise You)
So many times. You came through
(That's why I praise You)
Lord I praise You
(That's why I praise You)
Just for who You are
(That's why I praise You)
Ohh, ohh. for this
For this I give You praise
