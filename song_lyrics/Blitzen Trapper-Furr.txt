[Verse 1]
Yeah, when I was only seventeen,
I could hear the angels whispering
So I drove into the woods and wandered aimlessly about
Until I heard my mother shouting through the fog
It turned out to be the howling of a dog
Or a wolf to be exact
The sound sent shivers down my back
But I was drawn into the pack
And before long they allowed me to join in and sing their song
So from the cliffs and higher still
Yeah, we would gladly get our fill
Howling endlessly and shrilly at the dawn
And I lost the taste for judging right from wrong
For my flesh had turned to fur
Yeah, and my thoughts, they surely were
Turned to instinct and obedience to God
[Chorus]
You can wear your fur like a river on fire
But you better be sure if you're makin' God a liar
I'm a rattlesnake, babe, I'm like fuel on fire
So if you're gonna' get made don't be afraid of what you've learned
