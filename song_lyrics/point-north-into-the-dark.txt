[Intro: Jon Lundin]
Yeah
Yeah
Come on
Yeah
Uh
[Verse 1: Jon Lundin]
Don't wanna say I'm scared
What's it like being broken?
I know that life ain't fair
But you're the only one who cares
Yeah, if our pain is shared
You know it's yours I'm holding
'Cause if it's mine to bear
I'm not afraid to be repaired
[Pre-Chorus: Jon Lundin]
'Cause I'm treading in your water
And I don't wanna, but I gotta, yeah
You know I like it when I'm drowning
Reaching for your hand like it's all that I can count on
[Chorus: Jon Lundin]
Into the dark
Trying not to lose myself when I go too far
Where do I start
When every turn I take keeps us apart?
I need a sunrise in the dawn
Show me what the world is running from lately[Verse 2: Kellin Quinn]
I used to see you 'round almost every day
With some other guy, hand up on your waist
And I saw the smile that was on your face
I guess I never thought that you could just replace me, erase me
But now, babe, it doesn't even phase me
I kissed you goodbye and moved on from the madness
And like a phoenix, I rose from the ashes
[Pre-Chorus: Kellin Quinn]
'Cause I'm treading in your water
I don't wanna but I gotta, yeah
You know I like it when I'm drowning
Reaching for your hand like it's all I ever count on
[Chorus: Jon Lundin & 
Kellin Quinn
]
Into the dark
Trying not to lose myself when I go too far
Where do I start
When every turn I take keeps us apart?
I need a sunrise in the dawn 
(I need a sunrise in the dawn)
Show me what the world is running from
[Verse 3: Jon Lundin]
Shutting down 'cause I feel nothing
'Cause I'm always trying to find something
Feeling like I wanna give up, think I got a problem now
Don't believe in what I can't see
If I fall, I wanna fall free
Even if we never let go, you just gotta say so, oh-oh[Pre-Chorus: Jon Lundin & Kellin Quinn]
'Cause I'm treading in your water
And I don't wanna but I gotta, yeah
You know I like it when I'm drowning
Reaching for your hand like it's all that I can count on, yeah
[Chorus: Jon Lundin & 
Kellin Quinn
, 
both
]
Into the dark
Trying not to lose myself when I go too far
Where do I start
When every turn I take keeps us apart?
I need a sunrise in the dawn 
(I need a sunrise in the dawn)
Show me what the world is running from lately 
(Yeah)
I need a sunrise in the dawn 
(I need a sunrise in the dawn)
Show me what the world is running from 
(Yeah)
[Outro: Jon Lundin]
