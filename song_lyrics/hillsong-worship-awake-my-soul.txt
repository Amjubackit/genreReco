[Verse 1]
There is a sound I love to hear
It’s the sound of the Saviour’s robe
As He walks into the room where people pray
Where we hear praises He hears faith
There is a sound I love to hear
It’s the sound of the Saviour’s robe
As He walks into the room where people pray
Where we hear worship He hears faith
[Chorus]
Awake my soul and sing
Sing His praise aloud
Sing His praise aloud
Awake my soul and sing
Sing His praise aloud
Sing His praise aloud
[Verse 2]
There is a sound that changes things
The sound of His people on their knees
Oh wake up you slumbering
It’s time to worship Him
[Chorus]
Awake my soul and sing
Sing His praise aloud
Sing His praise aloud
Awake my soul and sing
Sing His praise aloud
Sing His praise aloud
