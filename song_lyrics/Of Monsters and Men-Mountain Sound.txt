[Verse 1: Ragnar Þórhallsson]
I heard them calling in the distance
So I packed my things and ran
Far away from all the trouble
I have caused with my two hands
[Pre-Chorus: Ragnar]
Alone we traveled armed with nothing but a shadow
We fled far away
[Chorus: Nanna Bryndís Hilmarsdóttir, 
Ragnar
]
Hold your horses now
(We sleep until the sun goes down)
Through the woods, we ran
(Deep into the mountain sound)
Hold your horses now
(We sleep until the sun goes down)
Through the woods, we ran
[Verse 2: Ragnar]
Some had scars and some had scratches
It made me wonder about their past
And as I looked around, I began to notice
That we were nothing like the rest
[Chorus: Nanna, 
Ragnar
]
Hold your horses now
(We sleep until the sun goes down)
Through the woods, we ran
(Deep into the mountain sound)
Hold your horses now
(We sleep until the sun goes down)
Through the woods, we ran
