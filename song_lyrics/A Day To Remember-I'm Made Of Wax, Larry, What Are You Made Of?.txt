[Chorus: Jeremy McKinnon]
Don't blink, they won't even miss you at all
And don't think that I'll always be gone
You know, I've got you like a puppet in the palm of my hand
Don't you let me down!
[Verse 1: Jeremy McKinnon]
So, run like hell
Sleep with one eye open, I can't forgive or forget you
We'll tell everyone the damage done
Deep down, you can't stop me, you can't stop me now!
[Pre-Chorus: Jeremy McKinnon]
I'll be there just to watch you fall
So, don't push me, I've got nothing to lose
[Chorus: Jeremy McKinnon]
Don't blink, they won't even miss you at all
And don't think that I'll always be gone
You know, I've got you like a puppet in the palm of my hand
Don't you let me down!
[Verse 2: Jeremy McKinnon]
Here I go again
I made it so damn hard to come back from the mess that you're in
I need you to know, I told you so
You're a snake and I'm cautious, just use your head!
