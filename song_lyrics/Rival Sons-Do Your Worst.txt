[Verse 1]
See that stranger coming over here
Though you don't recognise him, I know your preacher will
Got a voice like sugar, sugar in your teeth
And he could sing you any song now
Sing it sweeter than me
[Pre-Chorus]
Blind your eyes
Steal your tongue
Take it when you're old, but
But he likes 'em young
[Chorus]
Oh my, oh my baby
Devil's gonna get you if I don't first
Take my, take my body
Take my body and do your worst
Oh my, oh my baby
Devil's gonna get you if I don't first
Take my, take my body
Take my body and do your worst
[Verse 2]
If you see that stranger coming on the track
I can hear your mama just calling you back
Hit you like a fever, fever deep
And I touch you like a thief and leave your pockets clean
