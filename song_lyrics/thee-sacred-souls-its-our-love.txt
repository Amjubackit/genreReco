[Verse 1]
Can you feel it
Feel it in the air
Can you see it
See it in the sky
Baby it's our love
Baby it's our love
[Verse 2]
Can you feel it
Feel it in your heart
Can you see it
See it in the stars
It says
[Chorus]
You got what I need
And I got what you need
Baby, it's our love
Our love baby, it's our love
(baby, it's our love)
Our love baby, it's our love
(baby, it's our love)
[Verse 3]
Can you feel it
Feel it in the ground
Can you hear it
Hear it all around
It says
[Chorus]
You got what I need
And I got what you need
Baby, it's our love
Our love baby it's our love
(baby it's our love)
Our love baby it's our love
(baby it's our love)
[Outro]
Our love baby it's our love
(baby it's our love)
Our love baby it's our love
(baby it's our love)
