[Verse 1]
I hope you know if I go there
That I'm goin’ there for you
And if I go there
I won't be comin' home real soon
[Chorus]
We could laugh, we could shout
Sing a song to get it all out
Oh, we could whisper
We could dance, run about
But you keep starin’ at each other's mouths
Boy, go on, kiss her
[Post-Chorus]
It's all the things she do
It's all the things she does
It's all the things she'd do
It's everything she does
[Verse 2]
I think there might be snow there this time of year
You'll bring your snowshoes and I’ll bring the beer
[Chorus]
We could laugh, we could shout
Sing a song to get it all out
Oh, we could whisper (Whisper)
We could dance, run about
But you keep starin’ at each other's mouths
Boy, go on kiss her (Kiss her)
