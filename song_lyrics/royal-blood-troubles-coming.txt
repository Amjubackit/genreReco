[Verse 1]
I gave my knuckles a run for their money
Spider web cracks on the mirror
I see someone but not somebody
If I could, then I would
If I could, then I would
If I could
[Verse 2]
I let my demons take hold and choke on me
Can't fill these holes that I'm digging
Can't stop my heart when it's sinking
But if I could, then I would
If I could, then I would
If I could
[Pre-Chorus]
If I could, you don't think I would pretend
Trouble's coming but I still don't know when
That's the voice that I can hear in my head
I hear it over and over again
[Chorus]
I hear trouble coming, I hear trouble coming
I hear trouble coming over and over again
I hear trouble coming, I hear trouble coming
I hear trouble coming over and over again[Verse 3]
In my reflection, I see signs of psychosis
I try to pay them no attention
Can't keep them under the surface
If I could, then I would
If I could, then I would
If I could
[Pre-Chorus]
If I could, you don't think I would pretend
Trouble's coming but I still don't know when
That's the voice that I can hear in my head
I hear it over and over again
[Chorus]
I hear trouble coming, I hear trouble coming
I hear trouble coming over and over again
I hear trouble coming, I hear trouble coming
I hear trouble coming over and over again
[Bridge]
I can't wait forever
'Cause I don't have the time left to spend
Wishin' I was someone better
Wishin' I could start all over again[Chorus]
I hear trouble coming, I hear trouble coming
I hear trouble coming over and over again
I hear trouble coming, I hear trouble coming
I hear trouble coming over and over again
[Outro]
I hear trouble coming, I hear trouble coming
If I could, you don't think I would pretend
I hear trouble coming, I hear trouble coming
Trouble's coming but I still don't know when
I hear trouble coming, I hear trouble coming
That's the voice that I can hear in my head
I hear it over and over again
I hear trouble coming
I hear trouble coming
I hear trouble coming over and over again
I hear trouble coming
I hear trouble coming over and over again
