[Chorus:]
Your love's (your) so good (good love)
Deserves an encore (Deserves an encore)
Your love's (your) so good (good love)
You deserve an encore (deserves an encore)
Your love's (your) so good (good love)
Deserves an encore (Deserves an encore)
Your love's (your) so good (good love)
You deserve an encore (deserves an encore)
[Verse:]
Going to a show tonight
After working hard 9 to 5
Not talking 'bout a movie, no
Or a Broadway play, this show is live
[Pre-Chorus:]
And I know it's you I want to see tonight
(Wanna see you tonight)
I'll buy my ticket at the door if it's (Hey) alright
(If your performance make me feel good again)
[Chorus:]
Your love's (your) so good (good love)
Deserves an encore (Deserves an encore)
Your love's (your) so good (good love)
You deserve an encore (deserves an encore)
Your love's (your) so good (good love)
Deserves an encore (Deserves an encore)
Your love's (your) so good (good love)
You deserve an encore (deserves an encore)
[Pre-Chorus:]
And I know it's you I want to see tonight
(Wanna see you tonight)
I'll buy my ticket at the door if it's (Hey) alright
(If your performance make me feel good again)
[Verse:]
I can give you rave reviews
'Cause you sold out my heart with love
And every time that I'm with you
Boy, you take control, I'm your captive audience
[Pre-Chorus:]
And I know it's you I want to see tonight
(Wanna see you tonight)
I'll buy my ticket at the door if it's (Hey) alright
(If your performance make me feel good again)
[Chorus:]
Your love's (your) so good (good love)
Deserves an encore (Deserves an encore)
Your love's (your) so good (good love)
You deserve an encore (deserves an encore)
Your love's (your) so good (good love)
Deserves an encore (Deserves an encore)
Your love's (your) so good (good love)
You deserve an encore (deserves an encore)
Can't get enough, ooh
Of your gentle loving touch
I can't get enough
So intense, it drives me nuts
Makes me want to break it down now
Feels so good, feels so good
It deserves an encore
