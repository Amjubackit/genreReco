[Verse 1]
Bat your eyes girl, be otherworldly
Count your blessings, seduce a stranger
What's so wrong with being happy?
Kudos to those who see through sickness, yeah
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Over and over and over and over and...
Ooo-ooo
[Chorus]
When she woke in the morning
She knew that her life had passed her by
And she called out a warning
Don't ever let life pass you by
[Verse 2]
I suggest we learn to love ourselves
Before it's made illegal
When will we learn? When will we change?
Just in time to see it all fall down
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Those left standing, will make millions
Writing books on the way it should have been
[Chorus]
When she woke in the morning
She knew that her life had passed her by
And she called out a warning, warning
Don't ever let life pass you by
[Bridge]
Floating in this cosmic Jacuzzi
We are like frogs oblivious
To the water starting to boil
No one flinches, we all float face down
[Chorus]
When she woke in the morning
She knew that her life had passed her by
And she called out a warning, warning
Don't ever let life pass you by
[Outro]
Pass you by
Oh, oh, oh
