[Verse 1]
Running through my mind
The things I haven't told you (The things I haven’t told you)
Now I know I shouldn't lie
But I'm too scared to show you
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, don’t you wanna know?
Could get out of my hands when you lie in my bed
Been tryna take it slow
But I'm losing control and God only knows, that I
[Chorus]
Wish that I could be your lover
I never met a girl like that
I could treat you like no other
Wanna be yours so bad
Let me make you feel real
Baby we, maybe we make love all night
Oh, oh, oh
Wish that I could be your lover
Wish that I could be your—, wish that I could—
[Verse 2]
Funny that I find
You don't wanna fight it (You don't wanna fight it)
Baby, there's no need to be shy
'Cause I can tell you like it
