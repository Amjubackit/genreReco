[Verse 1]
You push me past my own capacity, boy
Permission to crash, collectin' damages, boy
No reachin' or grabbin' for more clarity now
Seek and destroy, all missiles deployed
[Chorus]
Do it to you
Do it to you
I had to do it to you
Do it to you, oh
Don't make me do it to you
Do it to you
Do it to you
I hate to do it to you, oh
Do what I gotta do, oh
[Verse 2]
I can't stand it, the urge
Is so demandin', the purge
So necessary, the art of war
Goddamn it, I'm drained
Now that I've ruined everything, I cannot complain
Now that I've ruined everything, I'm so fuckin' free
Now that I've ruined everything, keep it all for me
Now that I've ruined everything, space is all I need
[Chorus]
Do it to you
Do it to you
I had to do it to you
Do it to you, oh
Don't make me do it to you
Do it to you
Do it to you
I hate to do it to you, oh
Do what I gotta do, oh
[Bridge]
Chasin' fatter ass and fake connections
Chasin' fa√ßades in all directions
Chances are I've got no direction
Beggin' my angels for protection (Do it to you, oh)
Danger arise and I deflect it
New dick arrives and I erect it
Beggin' my angels for protection
Thankin' my stars, livin' reckless, oh
[Chorus]
Do it to you
Do it to you
I had to do it to you
Do it to you, oh
Don't make me do it to you
Do it to you
Do it to you
I hate to do it to you, oh
Do what I gotta do, oh
[Outro]
All the pain I know
Is used to fuel my soul
No control
I do it to you, do it to you, uh
All the hurt I know
Is used to heal my soul
No control
I do it to you, do it to you, oh
