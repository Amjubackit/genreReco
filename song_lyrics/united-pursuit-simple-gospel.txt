[Verse 1: Will Reagan]
I want to know You, Lord
Like I know a friend
I want to know You, Lord
I want to know You, Lord
Like I know a friend
I want to know You, Lord
[Chorus 1: Will Reagan]
So I'm laying down all my religion
I'm laying down
I want to know You, Lord
So I'm laying down all my religion
I'm laying down
I want to know You, Lord
[Verse 2: Will Reagan]
I use to think that I could box You in
But I'm laying down
I want to know You, Lord
I use to think that I could box You in
But I'm laying down
I want to know You, Lord
[Chorus 1: Will Reagan]
So I'm laying down all my religion
I'm laying down
I want to know You, Lord
So I'm laying down all my religion
I'm laying down
I want to know You, Lord
[Bridge 1: Brock Human]
Lord, I've been told to be ashamed
Lord, I've been told I don't measure up
Lord, I've been told I'm not good enough
But You're here with me
[Bridge 2: Brock Human]
And I reach out and You find me in the dust
You say no amount of untruths can separate us
(I reach out) I reach out and You find me in the dust
And You say no amount of untruths can separate us
(I reach out) I reach out and You find me in the dust
And You say no amount of untruths can separate us
[Chorus 2: Brock Human]
I will rejoice in the simple gospel
I will rejoice in You, Lord
I will rejoice in the simple gospel
I will rejoice in You, Lord
I will rejoice in the simple gospel
I will rejoice in You, Lord
[Bridge 2: Brock Human]
And I reach out and You find me in the dust
You say no amount of untruths can separate us
[Chorus 2: Will Reagan & Brock Human]
(I will rejoice) I will rejoice in the simple gospel
I will rejoice in You, Lord
I will rejoice in the simple gospel
I will rejoice in You, Lord
