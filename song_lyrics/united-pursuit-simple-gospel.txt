[Verse 1: Will Reagan]
I want to know You, Lord
Like I know a friend
I want to know You, Lord
I want to know You, Lord
Like I know a friend
I want to know You, Lord
[Chorus 1: Will Reagan]
So I'm laying down all my religion
I'm laying down
I want to know You, Lord
So I'm laying down all my religion
I'm laying down
I want to know You, Lord
[Verse 2: Will Reagan]
I use to think that I could box You in
But I'm laying down
I want to know You, Lord
I use to think that I could box You in
But I'm laying down
I want to know You, Lord
[Chorus 1: Will Reagan]
So I'm laying down all my religion
I'm laying down
I want to know You, Lord
So I'm laying down all my religion
I'm laying down
I want to know You, Lord
