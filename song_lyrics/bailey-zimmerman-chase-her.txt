[Verse 1]
Well she was fighting for something steady
And I was fighting her all fours and ready for
Anything that felt too heavy
Got damn good at leading her on
[Pre-Chorus]
But now she's gone
I let her go without a second thought
Now I'm the only one that can't move on
Still wanting it, still I'm wondering
[Chorus]
If I would have chased her
Would have just tried
Wouldn't have felt the sting of her goodbye
If I would've set aside a little more time and a lot more pride
Would she still be mine
I should've known better
Should've made the last call over the phone better
Should've been a little bit more of a go-getter
Would've saved myself from a whole lot of hurt
If I would've chased her
[Verse 2]
I wouldn't be kickin' myself
'Cause we'd be busy kickin' dust on a dirt road
Wherever the wind blows
Instead I'm in Hell
Watching her run, and run, and run, and run[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause now she's gone
I let her go without a second thought
Now I'm the only one that can't move on
Still wanting it, still wondering
[Chorus]
If I would've chased her
Would've just tried
Wouldn't have felt the sting of her goodbye
If I would've set aside a little more time and a lot more pride
Would she still be mine
I should've known better
Should've made the last call over the phone better
Should've been a little bit more of a go-getter
Would've saved myself from a whole lot of hurt
If I would've chased her
Ooh no, no
If I would've chased her, yeah yeah
[Bridge]
I should've known better
Now I'm all alone sipping something to forget her
Knowing that it's probably gonna take me forever
Till then I'll still be wanting it, still wondering[Chorus]
If I would've chased her
Would've just tried
Wouldn't have felt the sting of her goodbye
If I would've set aside a little more time and a lot more pride
Would she still be mine
I should've known better
Should've made the last call over the phone better
Should've been a little bit more of a go-getter
Would've saved myself from a whole lot of hurt
If I would've chased her
Ooh, no
If I would've chased her, yeah yeah
If I would've chased her
