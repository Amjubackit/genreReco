[Verse 1]
Draw blood with the way I hold your heart
Keep my eyes closed when I throw darts
Billy Bob and Angelina
Get my milk from Altadena
I can move to Pasadena
Just to be your serial killer, killer
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm cool with the fighting
Cool with the scratchin' and bitin'
(Doin' it right, doin' it right)
Yeah, I'm cool with the lighting
Cool with the way that you ride it
(Doin' it right, doin' it right)
[Chorus]
Sexy villain 
(Not the hero, I'm the west coast Bob De Niro)
Sexy villain 
(Super emo, aqua girl with the rising Leo)
Sexy villain 
(High libido, cheat on Chester, fuck with Fritos)
Sexy villain, villain, villain
[Verse 2]
Got a bird's eye view of the way you move
Follow you out of a crowded room
Switch my Bug for a brand new Beamer
Left my boy watching Euphoria
He's a keeper, big believer
Long as he don't check the freezer
Yum, yum, yum[Pre-Chorus]
I'm cool with the hiding
Cool if the cops aren't invited
(Doin' it right, doin' it right)
Yeah, I'm too tantalizing
Too good at keepin' 'em quiet
(Doin' it right, doin' it right)
[Chorus]
Sexy villain 
(Not the hero, I'm the west coast Bob De Niro)
Sexy villain 
(Super emo, aqua girl with the rising Leo)
Sexy villain 
(High libido, cheat on Chester, fuck with Fritos)
Sexy villain, villain, villain
[Post-Chorus]
Tip, tip, tippy-toe, tip, tip, tippy-toe, tiptoe
Tip, tip, tippy-toe, tip, tip, tippy-toe, tiptoe
Tip, tip, tippy-toe, tip, tip, tippy-toe, tiptoe
Tip, tip, tippy-toe, tip, tip, tippy-toe, tiptoe
[Bridge]
Sexy villain
Sexy villain
[Chorus]
Sexy villain 
(Not the hero, I'm the west coast Bob De Niro)
Sexy villain 
(Super emo, aqua girl with the rising Leo)
Sexy villain 
(High libido, cheat on Chester, fuck with Fritos)
Sexy villain, villain, villain[Post-Chorus]
Tip, tip, tippy-toe, tip, tip, tippy-toe, tiptoe
Tip, tip, tippy-toe, tip, tip, tippy-toe, tiptoe
Tip, tip, tippy-toe, tip, tip, tippy-toe, tiptoe
Tip, tip, tippy-toe, tip, tip, tippy-toe, tiptoe
