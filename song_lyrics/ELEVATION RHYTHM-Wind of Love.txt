[Verse 1: Joe L Barnes & Madisen Renee]
I put my sails in the air
I'm Yours, just take me anywhere
I'm casting all my cares
So You can take me anywhere
Anywhere
[Chorus: Joe L Barnes & Madisen Renee]
Just let the wind of love blow
Spirit, come and take control
And it doesn't matter where we go
Just let the wind of love blow, yeah
[Verse 2: Joe L Barnes & Madisen Renee]
'Cause I put my trust in the Lord
I won't let fear keep me on the shores
May I venture out into the deep, oh
Confident that You won't let me sink, yeah
[Chorus: Joe L Barnes & Madisen Renee]
But [?] let the wind of love blow
Spirit, come and take control
It doesn't matter where we go
Just let the wind of love blow
Say "Let the wind"
Let the wind of love blow
Breathe on us
Spirit, come and take control
And it doesnâ€™t matter where we go
Just let the wind of love blow, woah
