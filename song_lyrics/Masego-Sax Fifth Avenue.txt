[Chorus]
I've got fourteen dollars in my wallet
Open my case up, 'cause I ain't ballin' yet
Not yet
Panorama view, see all the ladies
Saks Fifth Avenue is where they pay me loads
For my shows
I've got fourteen dollars in my wallet
Open my case up, 'cause I ain't ballin' yet
Not yet
Panorama view, see all the ladies
Saks Fifth Avenue is where they pay me loads
For my shows
[Verse 1]
Feel like I belong to the streets
I work to make ends meet
Inside my mind, I'ma just fly
Take all my change, throw in the sky
I go where the money go
I relocate to the store
With a fear in my eyes, will I survive?
Playing to eat, praying to God
[Chorus]
I've got fourteen dollars in my wallet
Open my case up, 'cause I ain't ballin' yet
Not yet (Panorama)
Panorama view, see all the ladies
Saks Fifth Avenue is where they pay me loads
For my shows
