[Verse 1]
The sun shines brighter from above
And you're the woman that I love
Climb the mountain even higher
To kiss the sun and fight the fire
Oh well
[Chorus]
I'll make you mine
You're my sunshine
I'll make you mine
You're my sunshine
[Verse 2]
Take me with you when you go
To be with you is all I know
As we ride, we light the fire
The second sun's our love's desire
Oh well
[Chorus]
I'll make you mine
You're my sunshine
I'll make you mine
You're my sunshine
Oh well
