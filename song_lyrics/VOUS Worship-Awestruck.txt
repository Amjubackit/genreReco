[Verse 1]
Before I was formed, You knew my name
I was held in Your hands, and still today
You know me better
Than anyone could
[Verse 2]
From the moment I rise and through the night
You sing over me and breathe new life
With no hesitation
You're always waitin'
[Chorus]
I'm awestruck in wonder
I never knew love could feel like this
More than I wanted
Jesus, I can't get over it
[Verse 3]
One thing I ask, this I seek
To gaze on Your beauty and majesty
To dwell in Your presence
And livе for Your glory
[Chorus]
Awestruck in wonder
I nevеr knew love could feel like this
More than I wanted
Jesus, I can't get over it
I'm awestruck in wonder
I never knew love could feel like this
More than I wanted
Jesus, I can't get over it
