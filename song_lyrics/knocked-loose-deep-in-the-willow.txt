[Verse 1: Bryan Garris and 
Nicko Calderon
]
Deep in the willow
Hidden from grace
Succumb to insecurity, your final resting place
Crafting your perfect world
Ignoring total truth (
You'll die alone
)
There's only room for you
[Pre-Chorus: Bryan Garris and 
Isaac Hale
]
Fuck you
True colors shown
And I'm not impressed
[Chorus: 
Bryan Garris, Isaac Hale and Nicko Calderon
 and Bryan Garris]
A king to none
Atop your throne, you will die alone
King to none
Your greed lies deeper than blood
A king to none
Atop your throne, you will die alone
King to none
Your greed lies deeper than blood
[Post-Chorus: Bryan Garris]
Deep in the willow, you sink alone[Verse 2: Bryan Garris and 
Isaac Hale
]
Don't lose your balance on the fence
You're only swimming upstream
Tail tucked for the world to see
Living your life playing on both teams, no
It all comes back around
The tables turn
[Pre-Chorus: Bryan Garris]
A rat to most
To me less
True colors shown
And I'm not impressed
[Chorus: 
Bryan Garris, Isaac Hale and Nicko Calderon
 and Bryan Garris]
A king to none
Atop your throne, you will die alone
King to none
Your greed lies deeper than blood
A king to none
A rat to most, to me less
King to none
And I'm not impressed
[Outro: Bryan Garris 
and Isaac Hale
]
Knocked Loose, 
motherfucker
Deep in the willow
