[Verse 1]
Talk, talk‚ talk
Cheap language‚ standing up your pride
On a blanket of lies
Walk‚ walk, walk
Like a motherfucker, steady stride
So step aside
Say‚ say, say
Ain't a thing in this world you mind
Easy to unwind
Play, play‚ play
Tough looking, shady pair of eyes
Must be such a grind
[Instrumental Interlude]
[Verse 2]
Grown so tired of my own facade
Taking off my sunglasses inside
Try to keep a safe distance from the vacant lot
Empty styles from an empty mind
[Instrumental Outro]
