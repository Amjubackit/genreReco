[Verse 1]
I've never known someone like you
Tangled in love, stuck by you
From the glue
Don't forget to kiss me
Or else you'll have to miss me
I guess I'm stuck forever by the glue
Oh, and you
[Verse 2]
Finding the right words
To use for this song
I have you in mind
So it won't take so long
Never thought I'd find you
But you're here
And so I love you
[Chorus]
I'm not wrong
When I say I've been stuck
By the glue onto you
I've been stuck by glue
Right onto you
I've been stuck by glue
