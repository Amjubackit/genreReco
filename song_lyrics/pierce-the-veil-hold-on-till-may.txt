[Verse 1: Vic Fuentes]
She sits up high, surrounded by the sun
One million branches and she loves everyone
"Mom and dad, did you search for me?
I've been up here so long I'm going crazy"
[Chorus: Vic Fuentes]
And as the sun went down
We ended up on the ground
I heard the train shake the windows
You screamed over the sound
And as we own this night
I put your body to the test with mine
This love was out of control
3, 2, 1 - Where did it go?
[Verse 2: Vic Fuentes]
"Now don't be crazy, yes, now, of course, you can stay here"
Been in a touring band for going on ten years
"Big deal", she said, "I guess you're official."
I only said it because I know what it's like to feel burned out!
It gets you down, we've all been there sometimes
But tonight, I'll make you feel beautiful once again
[Chorus]
And as the sun went down
We ended up on the ground
I heard the train shake the windows
You screamed over the sound
And as we own this night
I put your body to the test with mine
This love was out of control
3, 2, 1 - Where did it go?
