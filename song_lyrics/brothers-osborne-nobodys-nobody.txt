[Verse 1]
Some wind up in the hall of fame
Some go down in a blaze of glory
Some people never ever make a name
But change the game in someone's story
I'm still tryna leave my mark
With a simple song and an old guitar
One thing I've learned out on the road is
Nobody's nobody
[Chorus]
Sun goes up
Sun goes down
Takes all kinds of kinds
To make this world go 'round
Everybody's somebody, someone
A sinner, saint, or son of a gun
Nobody's nobody
[Post-Chorus]
No, no, nobody
No, no, nobody
No, no, nobody's nobody
[Verse 2]
Someone's out fillin' their tank
Keepin' the good years on the road
While someone's fillin' up their drink
Forgettin' someone they can't let go
Some lovers leave their mark with a
Pocket knife and an oak tree heart
However you come, however you go
Nobody's nobody
[Chorus]
Sun goes up
Sun goes down
Takes all kinds of kinds
To make this world go 'round
Everybody's somebody, someone
A sinner, saint, or son of a gun
Nobody's nobody
[Post-Chorus]
No, no, nobody
No, no, nobody
No, no, nobody's nobody
[Chorus]
Sun goes up
Sun goes down
Takes all kinds of kinds
To make this world go 'round
Everybody's somebody, someone
A sinner, saint, or son of a gun
Nobody's nobody
[Post-Chorus]
No, no, nobody
No, no, nobody
No, no, nobody's nobody
No, no, nobody
Nobody's nobody
