[Intro: Channel Tres]
Channel Tres
Let’s go
When the bass slide and that city lights up
Like uh
Low high and that shit lights up
Like ah
When the bass slide and that city lights up
Like uh
Low high and that shit lights up
Like ah
Put your hands up
[Verse 1: Channel Tres]
I’m a MC, BYOB, bring your own bottles
VIP, MYOB, I brought my own models
Lay back, smooth with the flow
So smooth when I step on the floor
Look back, Cadillac
Used to pull up in the red Volvo
[Chorus: Myd]
Let me say, let me say...
We need lights up
Let the sun warm up
Warm up my body
Warm up my soul
Let’s go outside
Nude in the pool[Verse 2: Channel Tres]
Trying to catch the bass, and I’ll slide on you
Trying to catch a fade, bout to slide one on you
We up in the club, pour something in my cup
Got the whole city going up
Got the whole city going up
Out here acting up, no we don’t give a fuck
Got the whole city going up
Got the whole city going up
[Interlude: Myd]
Hey, it’s Myd. Sorry I forgot to download the stems, but send it back and I’m on it
[Chorus: Myd]
Let me say, let me say...
We need lights up
Let the sun warm up
Warm up my body
Warm up my soul
Let’s go outside
Nude in the pool
Let me say, let me say...
We need lights up
Let the sun warm up
Warm up my body
Warm up my soul
Let’s go outside
Nude in the pool[Outro: Channel Tres and (Myd)]
Got the whole city going up
Got the whole city going up (You need to move)
Got the whole city going up
Got the whole city going up (You need to move)
Got the whole city going up
Got the whole city going up (You need to move)
Got the whole city going up
Let’s go
Got the whole city going up (You need to move)
Got the whole city going up
Got the whole city going up (You need to move)
Got the whole city going up
Got the whole city going up (You need to move)
Got the whole city going up
Got the whole city going up (You need to move)
Got the whole city going up
Got the whole city going up
Got the whole city going up
Got the whole city going up
Got the whole city going up
