[Chorus]
Mm-hmm, and I said fuck it
Guess all that shit we been through
It just don't add up to nothin'
'Member times, I bought that bank out, just so I can get you somethin'?
Invested all this time and you just left with no discussion
Same bitch that stabbed my back said "I won't fold on you for nothing"
It's like we made some plans and I showed up but you ain’t come
What’s the point of building bridges if they burn, she up and run
Guess I’m gon' count these funds again
Getting money my only fun
[Verse]
Can't wait 'til I blow up just like a TNT (A TNT)
Just tell me how you feel and what you see in me (What you see in me)
I need my crib so big, this bitch a 'BNB (This shit 'BNB)
Back then when I was broke these hoes ain't think of Eem (They ain't think of Eem)
You tryna to placе the blame on me, that's not my fault (That's not my fault)
Don't judgе me 'bout my past, can't take this pain at all (Take this pain at all)
You said you’ll stick around, ain't answer when I called (When I called)
Ain’t like me I was broke but love me when I ball (Hahaha)
Best stay the fuck from 'round me (Yeah, yeah), for those who want to down me (Yeah, yeah)
Don’t get too close to people, I had to set that boundary (Yeah)
I had to cut my bitch, she had my mental drowning (Yeah, yeah)
I’m riding with my blick (Pew, pew), if you try me I might down 'em
I put that on my kids (My kids), I pulled up in a droptop (Skrrt)
You used to see my ribs, I kick it with this thot-thot
She tryna swallow my kids (My kids), I'm riding with this chopper
Got one inside the head, the head
[Chorus]
Mm-hmm, and I said fuck it
Guess all that shit we been through
It just don’t add up to nothin'
'Member times, I bought that bank out, just so I can get you somethin'?
Invested all this time and you just left with no discussion
Same bitch that stabbed my back said "I won't fold on you for nothing"
It's like we made some plans and I showed up but you ain’t come
What’s the point of building bridges if they burn, she up and run
Guess I'm gon' count these funds again
Getting money my only fun
[Outro]
Mm-hmm, and I said fuck it
Guess all that shit we been through
It just don’t add up to nothin'
'Member times, I bought that bank out, just so I can get you somethin'?
Invested all this time and you just left with no discussion
Same bitch that stabbed my back said "I won't fold on you for nothing"
It's like we made some plans and I showed up but you ain’t come
What's the point of building bridges if they burn, she up and run
Guess I'm gon' count these funds again
Getting money my only fun
