[Verse 1: Joe L Barnes & Madisen Renee]
I put my sails in the air
I'm Yours, just take me anywhere
I'm casting all my cares
So You can take me anywhere
Anywhere
[Chorus: Joe L Barnes & Madisen Renee]
Just let the wind of love blow
Spirit, come and take control
And it doesn't matter where we go
Just let the wind of love blow, yeah
[Verse 2: Joe L Barnes & Madisen Renee]
'Cause I put my trust in the Lord
I won't let fear keep me on the shores
May I venture out into the deep, oh
Confident that You won't let me sink, yeah
[Chorus: Joe L Barnes & Madisen Renee]
But [?] let the wind of love blow
Spirit, come and take control
It doesn't matter where we go
Just let the wind of love blow
Say "Let the wind"
Let the wind of love blow
Breathe on us
Spirit, come and take control
And it doesn’t matter where we go
Just let the wind of love blow, woah
[Interlude: Joe L Barnes]
Spirit, [?] breathe
Spirit, [?] breathe
Spirit of the Living God, breathe on us
We trust You, we don't care about [?] the waves get
Woah
[Bridge: Joe L Barnes & Madisen Renee]
And I won't lean on my own understanding
I trust that You won't ever leave me stranded
Fully sold out, hands high and heart abandoned
In the unknown, I will follow
I won't lean on my own understanding
I trust You won't (Won't leave me sinking in the waves)
Fully sold out, hands high and heart abandoned
In the unknown
[Chorus: Joe L Barnes & Madisen Renee]
I know You'll let the wind of love blow
Spirit, come and take control
Come and have Your way, come and have Your way
Doesn’t matter where we go
(It doesn't matter where we, I'm followin' You)
Just let the wind of love blow (Let it blow, let it blow)
And I won't
[Bridge: Joe L Barnes & Madisen Renee]
And I won't lean on my own understanding (I'm leanin' on Jesus)
I trust You won't ever leave me stranded
(The unchanging hand, the unchanging rock)
I'm fully sold out, hands high and heart abandoned
In the unknown, I will follow (I won't lean)
I won't lean on my own understanding
(I'm leanin' on the firm foundation)
I trust You won't ever leave me stranded
(You won't leave me stranded)
Fully sold out, hands high and heart abandoned
In the unknown
[Outro: Joe L Barnes]
I put my sails in the air
I'm Yours, just take me anywhere
I put my sails in the air
I'm Yours, just take me anywhere
