[Chorus]
I thank You for it all
The good, bad, the ugly, great and small
The times of victory and when I fall
I'm so grateful that I'm still standing tall
I thank You for my tears
The pain helped me overcome my fears
You been good to me down throughout the years
It's a miracle that I'm still standing here
[Refrain]
All that I am is because
Of all that You brought me through
And everything I survived
It's all because of You
[Chorus]
I thank You for it all
The good, bad, the ugly, great and small (Mmm)
The times of victory and when I fall (Oh, my)
I'm so grateful that I'm still standing tall (I thank You for my tears)
I thank You for the tears (The pain helped me)
The pain helped me overcome my fears (Pain helped me overcome my fears)
You been good to me down throughout the years (Yes, You have)
It's a miracle I'm still standing here
