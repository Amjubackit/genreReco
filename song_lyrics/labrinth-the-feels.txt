[Verse 1: Labrinth]
I got hit by a truck, I got hit by a truck
And it drove off and left me here for dead
Alone lyin' here, cryin' in the rain, yeah
[Pre-Chorus: Labrinth]
I got touched by God and it fucked me up
Like an electrical current coursin' through my veins
Lightning came and hit me again
[Chorus: Labrinth]
Now I'm in my feels
Way up in the clouds somewhere now
Don't know what's real, real
I'm ghost, gone missin'
I don't even know if I'm here now
But I'm in my feels, feels
[Post-Chorus: Labrinth]
Feels
[Verse 2: Zendaya]
Now you got me lost in emotion
Now you got me intoxicated with your drug
Bloodstream racin', heartbeat pulsin'
The truth of it is I'm in love with you, I
[Pre-Chorus: Zendaya, Zendaya & Labrinth]
Oh, I got touched by God and it fuckеd me up
Like an elеctrical current pulsin' through my veins
Lightning, come and hit me again
[Chorus: Zendaya & Labrinth]
I'm in my feels
Way up in the clouds somewhere now
Don't know what's real, real
I'm ghost, gone missin'
I don't even know if I'm here now
I'm in my feels, feels
[Outro: Labrinth & Zendaya]
Feels
(In my) Feels
(I'm in my) Feels
(I'm in my) Feels
