[Intro]
I can move mountains
I can work a miracle, work a miracle
Ooh, oh, oh, I'll keep you like an oath
May nothing but death do us part
[Chorus]
She wants to dance like Uma Thurman
Bury me 'til I confess
She wants to dance like Uma Thurman
And I can't get you out of my head
[Verse 1]
The stench, the stench of summer sex
And CK Eternity - oh Hell yes
Divide me down to the smallest I can be
Put your, put your v-v-v-venom in me
[Pre-Chorus]
I can move mountains
I can work a miracle, work a miracle
Ooh, oh, oh, I'll keep you like an oath
May nothing but death do us part
[Chorus]
She wants to dance like Uma Thurman
Bury me 'til I confess
She wants to dance like Uma Thurman
And I can't get you out of my head
