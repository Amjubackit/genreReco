[Verse]
Father's endless mercy
Prepared a table for me
How can it even be
You sent Your Son down to save me
[Pre-Chorus]
No other name will I praise but Yours
No other name will I praise but Yours
[Chorus]
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus
You're the lover of my soul
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus
You're the lover of my soul
[Interlude]
You have my heart
[Bridge]
Whoa oh I am so in love
And there's no-one else for me
Whoa oh I am so in love
And there's no-one else for me
Whoa oh I am so in love (so in love)
And there's no-one else for me (no-no-no-no)
Whoa oh I am so in love (so in love)
And there's no-one else for me (no-no-no)[Pre-Chorus]
No other name will I praise but Yours
No other name will I praise but Yours
[Chorus]
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus
You're the lover of my soul
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus
You're the lover of my soul
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus
You're the lover of my soul
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus
You're the lover of my soul
