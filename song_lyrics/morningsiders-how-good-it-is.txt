[Verse 1]
What the hell were we doing
Before we were in love?
Just think of all the wasted time
Just can't get enough of you
[Chorus]
I never knew
How good it is
To young and admired
How good it is
To feel your fire
How good it is
To be your lover today
[Verse 2]
What the hell were we doing
When we first started out?
Had no idea what we were in for
Or what this was about
[Chorus]
I never knew
No, I never knew
How good it is
To be young and admired
How good it is
To feel your fire
How good it is
To be your lover today[Chorus]
How good it is
To be young and admired
How good it is
To feel your fire
And how good it is
To be your lover today
How good it is
To be your lover today
How good it is
To be your lover today
[Outro]
I never knew it felt this way
