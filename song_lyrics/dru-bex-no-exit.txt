Verse 1
I got  no time to hesitate or contemplate, I won’t consider no plan B, no, I’m just stuck on A
Been about this here life and there’s no exit, I don’t got no regrets because God blessed it
Looking at my guest list, I be with the Young and the restless, scrolling going down my  checklist
Like, what we doing right now? Dogs dem getting rowdy, had to pipe down
There’s a time and a place, I been feeling jaded like there’s lines in my face

Will I see tomorrow I don’t know, I don’t have to worry, God is in control
He told me that he already blessed this
So I’m going in like there’s no exit
(Harmony) Will I see tomorrow I don’t really know, no, I don’t have to worry God is in control

Verse 2
I been viewing from my city, seeing who’s about it like I’m choosing my committee
I know some young boys spitting truth who are so litty

But I only roll with real ones, who don’t fold for this and that
Get the jelly out your spine, put a bone in your back
If all of your toes intact, then don’t let a man hold you back
Not even you, God is the one who designed you and he gave you something to do
If you ain’t doing it, why ain’t you doing it What do you think is the problem with you
Maybe you think you know better than God, and your doing just what you wanted to do
Take it from me, swallow your pride, ‘cause humble pie’s much harder to chew, yeah
