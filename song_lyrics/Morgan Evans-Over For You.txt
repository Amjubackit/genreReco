[Verse 1]
How long have you been waiting
To take our pictures down?
How long have you been breaking?
Why am I just finding out?
It kills me to know
You were drifting alone
You don't have to stay, no
But can I say before you go?
[Chorus]
I would have searched the whole world over for you
Took a flight, through the night
To be that shoulder for you, and
I would've let go if you wanted me to
How many times did you say you loved me
When it wasn't true?
I'm just wondering
How long has it been over for you?
[Post-Chorus]
How long, how long, how long, how long?
How long?
How long, how long, how long, how long?
How long?
