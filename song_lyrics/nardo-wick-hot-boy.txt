[Intro: Nardo Wick]
Ha, ha (Cheeze, Cheeze, Cheeze), ha
(Go Grizz), ha, ha, ha
Ha
[Chorus: Nardo Wick]
I'm a hot boy, drive all my cars like it's urgent
I'm a hot boy, don't get too close 'cause I might burn you
I'm a hot boy but I put ice on all my bitches
I'm a hot boy, I bring the fire to the trenches
I'm a hot boy, I'm a hot boy (Ha)
I'm a hot boy, I'm a hot boy (Ha)
I'm a hot boy, I'm a hot boy (Ha)
I'm a hot boy, I'm a hot boy (Ha)
[Verse 1: Nardo Wick]
I'm a hot boy but got a lot of cold bitches
What's that half a milli' on my neck? Four-fifty
Drop a load off to the trap and tell my lil' ones, "Get busy"
Don't let nobody tell you different, we the littest in the city
I'm a hot boy, I tell the jeweler, "Cool me down"
Still be posted in the hood, a lot of killers sittin' 'round
He was on the sidеline, caught 'em at an angle, forcеd him out of bounds
Send them hot boys on a blitz and tell 'em, "Burn that nigga down"
Ayy, woedie, who that is right there? She look like my type
Don't care bout how big her booty is, won't hit if it don't feel right
Ayy, woedie, who is that young nigga that be fly?
It's a bird, it's a plane, nah, that's Nardo in the sky
Ayy, woedie, who that goin' a hundred in a fifty?
I'm the richest, youngest nigga, ain't nobody fuckin' with me
Ayy, woedie, who is that lil' nigga with all the hoes?
If you look good, you look good, I ain't tryna hear that you too old
[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
Baby, I could pop out right now pull my big one on these hoes (Damn)
I'm not acrobatic, I'm not flippin' on my bros (No)
All my shit be factual, I cannot get exposed (At all)
Grew up talkin' slick, I'll catch a bitch before I catch a cold
I ain't tryna kick it with you niggas, I got broke toes
Don't take it offensive, I'm too rich to fuck with broke hoes
I won't drive my TRX no more, that shit just too slow
Maybach white on white, they know about it, ask my new ho
I know a couple of these niggas really hatin' on me (Think so)
I know a bitch who actin' faithful, but she waitin' on me (Think so)
I don't fuck with none of you niggas, I can't fake it no more
Who is that, that's your Lambo? Hell, yeah
Oh, that's Nardo? Let him in
Think I'm runnin’ out of hidin' spots, this shit been comin' in
He was in our business and got spanked, he shouldn't have butted in
I come from that block where shit be hot, the summer never end
I'm really the one this shit done settled in
[Chorus: Nardo Wick]
I'm a hot boy, drive all my cars like it's urgent
I'm a hot boy, don't get too close 'cause I might burn you
I'm a hot boy but I put ice on all my bitches
I'm a hot boy, I bring the fire to the trenches
I'm a hot boy, I'm a hot boy (Ha)
I'm a hot boy, I'm a hot boy (Ha)
I'm a hot boy, I'm a hot boy (Ha)
I'm a hot boy, I'm a hot boy (Ha)
