[Verse 1]
He's so beautiful
Makes me wanna believe
He's got a heart of gold
That nobody can see
Bringing party favors
Dollar bills rolled nice and neat
Party boy, you took too much
It's time for you to leave
[Pre-Chorus]
I want to want you, baby
But you're making it so hard
I tried to bite the bullet
And just take you as you are
[Chorus]
You get too close
Take the one I love the most
I think it's time for you to go
Make it so hard you know you've gone too far and
I think it's time for you to go
[Verse 2]
So predictable just like what they told me
He's staring at the floor tail between your kneesFragile like I've never seen
You're pretty when you do not speak
Fragile like I've never seen
You're pretty when you do not speak
[Pre-Chorus]
You're so unsure
You're so afraid
Don't tell me to listen when you got nothing to say
[Chorus]
You get too close
Take the one I love the most
I think it's time for you to go
Make it so hard you know you've gone too far and
I think it's time for you to go
[Post-Chorus]
You're so unsure
You're so afraid
Don't tell me to listen when you got nothing to say
