[Intro]
You could have anyone you want
Why would you want to be with me?
I'm nothing special
You could have anyone you want
Why would you want to be with me?
You know, I'm nothing special
[Chorus]
Be with whoever you want
I don't care, I don't care
I don't wanna know
Don't tell me about your problems
If you're not trying to solve them
Don't ask me for my help
[Verse]
Fix it yourself
She tried to call me yesterday
But I didn't pick up
'Cause I don't got time
I don't have time
I don't have time
I don't have time
I don't have time (No)
