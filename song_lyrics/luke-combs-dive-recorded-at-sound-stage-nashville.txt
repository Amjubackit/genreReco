[Verse 1]
Well, maybe I came on too strong
Maybe I waited too long
Maybe I played my cards wrong, oh, just a little bit wrong
Baby, I apologize for it
[Pre-Chorus]
I could fall or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
And I could live or I could die
Hangin' on the words you say
And I've been known to give my all
And jumpin' in harder than
Ten thousand rocks on the lake
[Chorus]
So don't call me baby
Unless you mean it
And don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
So let me know the truth
Before I dive right in to you
[Verse 2]
You're a mystery, I've travelled the world
And there's no other girl like you, no one
What's your history? (What's your history?)
Do you have a tendency to lead some people on? 'Cause I heard you do, mhm
[Pre-Chorus]
I could fall or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
Or I could live and I could die
Hanging on the words you say
And I've been known to give my all
And lie awake, every day
Don't know how much I can take
[Chorus]
So don't call me baby
Unless you mean it
And don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
So let me know the truth
Before I dive right in to you
[Instrumental Break]
[Pre-Chorus]
I could fall or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
And I could live or I could die
Hangin' on the words you say
And I've been known to give my all
Sittin' back, lookin' at
Every mess that I made
[Chorus]
So don't call me baby
Unless you mean it
And don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
So let me know the truth
Before I dive right in to you
[Outro]
Before I dive right in to you
Before I dive right in to you
