[Refrain]
They scared to come outside
[Verse 1]
I know why, because they dyin' for sure
2010, winter time, 
Pelle on, I gotta match the coat
Shared a room with my cousin, I snuck and told him I had a gun
I do believe in my spirits, can't hop on a Spirit, that flight too long
YouTube niggas tryna paint a picture of me, it never last too long
Not too much on violence, but, nigga, I'm silent, but, nigga, I'm glad you gone
If you got a name and you stand on business, you can't be the first to fold
Bro got a body, but brodie got four bodies, he the first to told
On my back is a burden, bro in the car and I did it on purposе
They in Suburbans, bro in the Track' and he hoppеd on the curb then
Brodie moved back 'cause brodie started lackin' just off his girlfriend
I was stackin', had to sleep on the mattress, nigga, I ain't perfect
Take him out to slide, he can't even focus, thinkin' what his girl did
I can't even lie and I love the guys and we make the world spin
On the jail call, but we still risk it 'cause it gotta merge in
Never post the guns that's really involved, 'cause they lurkin'
Where I'm from, you don't get old, I know some killers that told
I know secrets that nobody know, pray for me, I'm on the road
Give it all up for my bros
When you keepin' your mouth closed, ain't nobody gettin' exposed
