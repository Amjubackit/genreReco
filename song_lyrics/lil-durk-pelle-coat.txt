(DJ on the beat, so it's a banger)
[Refrain]
They scared to come outside
[Verse 1]
I know why, because they dyin' for sure
2010, winter time, Pelle on, I gotta match the coat
Shared a room with my cousin, I snuck and told him I had a gun
I do believe in my spirits, can't hop on a Spirit, that flight too long
YouTube niggas tryna paint a picture of me, it never last too long
Not too much on violence, but, nigga, I'm silent, but, nigga, I'm glad you gone
If you got a name and you stand on business, you can't be the first to fold
Bro got a body, but brodie got four bodies, he the first to told
On my back is a burden, bro in the car and I did it on purposе
They in Suburbans, bro in the Track' and he hoppеd on the curb then
Brodie moved back 'cause brodie started lackin' just off his girlfriend
I was stackin', had to sleep on the mattress, nigga, I ain't perfect
Take him out to slide, he can't even focus, thinkin' what his girl did
I can't even lie and I love the guys and we make the world spin
On the jail call, but we still risk it 'cause it gotta merge in
Never post the guns that's really involved, 'cause they lurkin'
Where I'm from, you don't get old, I know some killers that told
I know secrets that nobody know, pray for me, I'm on the road
Give it all up for my bros
When you keepin' your mouth closed, ain't nobody gettin' exposed
[Refrain]
They scared to come outside
[Verse 2]
I know they is, but niggas scared to pop out for days
Back in the day when it was seven-fifty minimum wage
I was bad, mama sent me to Michigan to get out the way
I ain't know what to say, I knew he was dead when they pulled out the tape
That shit was a shame, he died right in front of me, Auntie say I'm a snake
I ain't mention Lil Bear name, Ciara said I'm strange
Auntie Googie lost her daughter, called my phone back, I ain't know what to say
Ask the kids for visits, they mamas never did it like I'm the one who be playin'
See, brodie, that was my mans, but he let him get in his head, what I'm sayin'
Like how I'ma sacrifice Von? I'm the only nigga reached for his hand
Like why lie like I ain't give up money for the funeral? I'm like, "Damn"
I ain't see his kids yet, same time they probably believe what they hearin'
I ain't makin' statements for the whole case, like how I'ma tell on my mans?
They ain't never have enough evidence, tell 'em free Zoo out that can
I call Fat Fat to talk to the kids, I don't think Son-Son know that he dead
Life insurance money, whole lot of Ms
So when I'm dead they'll never miss meals
I don't know why they hate me so much
Got it back from revenge, so what?
Why they lie on my name so much?
Why I be with the gang so much?
Why they do it for the fame so much?
Keep tellin' him, "Slide," he ain't on nothin'
Keep tellin' him, "Slide," he ain't on nothin'
[Refrain]
They scared to come outside
[Verse 3]
Niggas be lyin' on blogs to get up some views
Fell out with every one 'cause his son called, asked a nigga for shoes
I was outside movin' and forgot, I ain't tryna make an excuse
Tried to tell Varney that I forgot about him 'cause he still in the zoo
Could've been came around, I was in therapy, wasn't tryna front my move
Like I don't wanna fuck 'cause you bro, mama, I'm just thinkin' it through
I fucked one time, I told Wukaduk 'cause I think it's cool
A lot of people in the trenches say they hate me, shit, I hate you too, uh
I send money to jails, I send money for funerals
Even though they goin' to hell for all them niggas they killed
You know I'm part of my brother 'nem forever ever, ever, I'm goin' to hell
You know I'm part of my brother 'nem, I'm never, ever, ever gon' tell
Like why I'ma have a baby on my bitch? I'm different, I'm not crazy
Man, brodie died 'cause he beat up a goofy, man, this shit nothin' 'bout Asian
Why you praise a nigga who told on brodie 'nem? Man, you niggas too crazy
When Thang died, a nigga died, another nigga died, we thangin'
You the same nigga told me your block ain't shit, them boys fugazi
When you think about it, you the same nigga, ain't shoot shit, you niggas is crazy
When I'm in the 'Raq, if I ain't goin' to Tay Town, nigga, I'ma slide on Damen
What you doin' in the trenches, brodie, when they want you dead and they know that you famous?
Mornin' time I get on my knees, I pray to Allah
Forgive me for the shit that I did
Let me get closer to my kids
Can you protect all my friends?
[Outro]
They scared to come outside
And we ain't, I know we ain't scared
I know what we did
(Scared to come outside)
