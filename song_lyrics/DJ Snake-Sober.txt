[Intro: JRY]
Come on, tell me do you want me
Do you need me like drugs need money
Tell me once more who's your love for?
What's your number when you're sober?
[Chorus: JRY]
Clearly I'm not thinkin' clearly
When I'm, when I'm, with you, with you
Feels like time is movin' slower
And then the music pulls us closer
Oh when I start to think it over
I realize
[Drop: JRY]
You never call me when you're sober
You never call me when you're sober
I realize
[Chorus: JRY]
Clearly I'm not thinkin' clearly
When I'm, when I'm, with you, with you
Nearly Heaven when you're near me
Fallin', fallin', for you, for you
We're addicted to this feeling
When I'm, when I'm, with you, with you
Feels like time is movin' slower
And then the music pulls us closer
Oh when I start to think it over
I realize
