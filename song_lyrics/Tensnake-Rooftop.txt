And I remember when
We used to wake up early
And stay out late
And those were the good days
And everybody said
That our time, it wouldn't last
But I didn't care
No I was still there for you
Now ignorance is bliss
Don't you wish you never had to grow up
And keep livin' like this
And still believe in magic and white rabbits and miracles
I still believe in love at first sight
And impossible feelings
Can you hear me now
Cause I'm screaming your name
And I'm cursing the day from the rooftops
Meet me on the roof
Causе I'm screaming your name
And I'm cursing the day from thе rooftops
Meet me on the roof
