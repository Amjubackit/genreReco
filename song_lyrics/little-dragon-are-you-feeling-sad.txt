[Intro]
La-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la
[Chorus: Little Dragon]
No worries, no worries, no
You're gonna be alright, uh-huh
Don’t worry, don't worry, oh
Things gonna turn out fine, uh-huh, oh
Don't worry, don’t worry, no
You're gonna be alright though
No worries, no worries, no
Things gonna turn out fine, uh-huh, ooh
[Verse: Kali Uchis]
All the people that we lost
Light the way when we're in the dark
Wondering what might've been
Will never ever change a thing
Tryna mend this broken heart
It's okay not to be strong
My sorrows have a million layers
And I've been told I wear them well
I'm happy for the time we shared
Nothing could ever compare
In the end I'll meet you there
Yeah, you know where
I’ll meet you-
I’m happy for the sun and air
When it rains I love the smell
Happy for the love we shared
Yeah, nothing could ever compare
[Refrain]
La-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la
[Chorus: Little Dragon]
No worries, no worries, no
You're gonna be alright, uh-huh
Don’t worry, don't worry, oh
Things gonna turn out fine, uh-huh, oh
