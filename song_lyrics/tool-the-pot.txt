[Verse 1]
Who are you to wave your
 
finger
?
You must've been out your head
Eye hole deep in muddy waters
You practically raised the dead
Rob the grave to snow the cradle
Then burn the evidence down
Soapbox house of cards and glass so
Don't go tossin' your stones around
You must've been high
You must've been high
You must've been
[Bridge 1]
Foot in mouth and head up ass
So whatcha talkin' 'bout?
Difficult to dance 'round this one
'Til you pull it out, boy
You must've been so high
You must've been so high
[Verse 2]
Steal, borrow, refer, save your shady inference
Kangaroo done hung the juror with the innocent
Now you're weepin' shades of cozened indigo
Got lemon juice up in your eye
When you pissed all over my black kettle
You must've been high, high
You must've been high, high
