[Verse 1: Abbie Gamboa]
I don't know how to say exactly how I feel
I can't begin to tell you what Your love has meant
I'm lost for words
[Verse 2: Abbie Gamboa]
Is there a way to show the passion in my heart?
Can I express how truly great I think You are?
My dearest friend
[Pre-Chorus]
This is my desire
To pour my love on You
[Chorus]
Like oil upon Your feet
Like wine for You to drink
Life water from my heart
I pour my love on You
If praise is like perfume
I'll lavish mine on You
Till every drop is gone
I'll pour my love on You
[Verse 1: Abbie Gamboa]
Oh, I don't know how to say exactly how I feel
I can't begin to tell you what Your love has meant
I'm lost for words[Verse 2: Abbie Gamboa]
(Is there a way?) Is there a way to show the passion in my heart?
Can I express how truly great I think You are?
My dearest friend
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, this is my desire
To pour my love on You
[Chorus]
Like oil upon Your feet
Like wine for You to drink
Life water from my heart
I'll pour my love on You
If praise is like perfume
Then I'll lavish mine on You
Till every drop is gone
I'll pour my love
Like oil upon Your feet
Like wine for You to drink
Life water from my heart
I'll pour my love on You
If praise is like perfume
I'll lavish mine on You
Till every drop is gone
I'll pour my love on You[Post-Chorus: Abbie Gamboa]
On You
On You
Oh
On You
On You
On You
On You
Oh
[Chorus: Abbie Gamboa & Jonathan Lewis]
Like oil upon Your feet
Like wine for You to drink
Life water from my heart
I'll pour my love on You
If praise is like perfume
I'll lavish mine on You
Till every drop is gone
I'll pour my love
Like oil upon Your feet
Like wine for You to drink
Life water from my heart
I'll pour my love on You
If praise is like perfume
I'll lavish mine on You
Till every drop is gone
(I'll pour my love)[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus: Abbie Gamboa]
Like wine for You to drink
Life water from my heart
I'll pour my love on You
If praise is like perfume
I'll lavish mine on You
Till every drop is gone
I'll pour my love on You
[Post-Chorus: Abbie Gamboa]
On You
On You
On You
On You
On You
On You
