[Intro]
Let's go!
[Verse 1]
With bloodshot eyes, I watch you sleeping
The warmth I feel beside me is slowly fading
Would she hear me if I called her name?
Would she hold me if she knew my shame?
[Pre-Chorus]
There's always something different going wrong
The path I walk's in the wrong direction
There's always someone fucking hanging on
Can anybody help me make things better?
[Chorus]
Your tears don't fall, they crash around me
Her conscience calls the guilty to come home
Your tears don't fall, they crash around me
Her conscience calls the guilty to come home
[Verse 2]
The moments die, I hear no screaming
The visions left inside me are slowly fading
Would she hear me if I called her name?
Would she hold me if she knew my shame?
[Pre-Chorus]
There's always something different going wrong
The path I walk's in the wrong direction
There's always someone fucking hanging on
Can anybody help me make things better?
[Chorus]
Your tears don't fall, they crash around me
Her conscience calls the guilty to come home
Your tears don't fall, they crash around me
Her conscience calls the guilty to come home
[Post-Chorus]
Oh!
Yeah!
[Bridge]
This battered room I've seen before
The broken bones they heal no more, no more
With my last breath, I'm choking
Will this ever end? I'm hoping
My world is over, one more time!
Let's go!
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge]
Would she hear me if I called her name?
Would she hold me if she knew my shame?
[Pre-Chorus]
There's always something different going wrong
The path I walk's in the wrong direction
There's always someone fucking hanging on
Can anybody help me make things better?
[Chorus]
Your tears don't fall, they crash around me
Her conscience calls the guilty to come home (Tears don't fall)
Your tears don't fall, they crash around me (Conscience calls)
Her conscience calls the guilty to come (Better!)
Your tears don't fall, they crash around me (Conscience calls)
Her conscience calls the guilty to come home!
