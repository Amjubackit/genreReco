[Verse 1]
Mirrors in the sun
Wanna keep you by my side
Morning just begun
Wanna fall into the night
[Pre-Chorus]
Cause you keep the love for yourself
Can he treat you like no one else
Did you hear the lies that you tell
But love will take us back
Tonight
[Chorus]
You are fading away
We're strangers in the night
Hold on
There’s no turning back
We're strangers in the night
Hold on
[Verse 2]
Feel it in your touch
That things are not the same
Never needed much
But don't wanna play the game
[Pre-Chorus]
Cause you keep the love for yourself
Can he treat you like no one else
Did you hear the lies that you tell
But love will take us back
Tonight
[Chorus]
You are fading away
We’re strangers in the night
Hold on
There's no turning back
We're strangers in the night
Hold on
Hold on
You are fading away
We're strangers in the night
Hold on
There's no turning back
We're strangers in the night
Hold on
You are fading away
We're strangers in the night
Hold on
There's no turning back
We’re strangers in the night
Hold on
Hold on
