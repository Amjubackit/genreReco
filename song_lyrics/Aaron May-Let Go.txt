The time, can't erase, together, oh

together, oh

[Verse]
Fucked up nigga, I don't want your pity
I just wanted love, but I'm way too busy
Rap moving up, I might come to your city
It's hot in the H, but my heart still chilly
I just need a gram, some bread, and a quickie
If I ain't your man, I don't want no hickey
Right now I ain't shit 'cause the road look shitty
Been like that for months, I might roll a blunt
And hit that shit once 'cause a nigga been sober (Goddamn)
God, I can't wait 'til the day this shit over (Goddamn)
Used to walking 'round with a chip on my shoulder
For every last person I loved who folded (I know)
I would give grace, but I'd rather give closure (I know)
I would take breaks, but I'd rather move forward (I won't)
I done been chewed up, spit out, kicked out, let down
But I'm still a motherfucking soldier
So fuck what you told me if you showed me different
Fuck what you showed me if you came up missing
I know that actions speak louder than words
The thing about yours, they never consistent
I done got paid more than I paid attention
I done felt pain more than I like to mention
Heart on my sleeve 'til it's left on the curb
When I smoke this herb I can't make good decisions
You niggas be bitches, you bitches be hoes
You switching up more than you switch your clothes
I push that work 'til I get it in gold
And light up that heat when the nights get too cold
The only thing keeping me up from the lows
Besides all the bread I'ma make from these shows
My life going fast and I like moving slow
And I've been on numb four, five days in a row
