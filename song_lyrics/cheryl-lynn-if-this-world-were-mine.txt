[Verse 1: Luther Vandross]
If this world were mine
I would place at your feet
All that I own
You've been so good to me
If this world were mine
I'd give you the flowers, the birds, and the bees
And with your love beside me
That would be all I need
If this world were mine
I'd give you anything
[Verse 2: Cheryl Lynn]
If this world were mine
I would make you a king
With wealth untold
You could have anything
If this world were mine
I'd give your each day, so sunny and blue
And if you wanted the moonlight
I'd give you that too
If this world were mine, oh baby
I'd give you anything
[Bridge: Luther Vandross, Cheryl Lynn]
Oh baby, you're my inspiration
And there's no hesitation
When you want me
Honey, just call me
Oh baby, you are my consolation
And I feel so much sensation
When I'm in your arms
When you squeeze me
Oh, the way that you do
Oh, the way that you love me, boy
Oh yeah, oh yeah, the way that you do
Ooh, the way that you love me
[Outro: Luther Vandross, Cheryl Lynn, Both]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, every sky would be blue
As long as you're loving me, baby
(Ooh) Whoa, whoa, oh
When I'm here in your arms
Life is so wonderful, my love
Oh, oh, oh, give me pretty lovin', baby
Give me pretty lovin', honey
Keep on lovin' me, baby
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
You know I need you, honey
You know I need you, baby
Keep on loving me
Lovin' me the way (The way) you do
(You do) My lover
I love the way that you, the way that you love me, baby
Oh, and I don't wanna let you go, wanna let you go
I love the way, the way that you love me, baby
Don't wanna let you go, my love
Mmm, ooh
You know
Woo-hoo
The world, the world would be yours
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah (Mmm)
Yes, it would (Yes, it would)
The world would be yours
Baby (Baby)
Ooh, hoo, it would be yours
If you believe
