[Verse 1]
I wouldn't deny you if you asked me
I'd rather die than to blaspheme
But if I need a ride in your back seat
Will you be there for me?
See me on the path on your way home
Might need a mattress to sleep on
But if I'm gone at dawn, would it be wrong?
Will you be there for me?
[Chorus]
Will you walk with me down a lonely street?
Talk to me, tell me what you see
Stand by me so the world will see
You and me in unity
Ay yah, ay yah, ay yah
You and me in unity
Ay yah, ay yah, ay yah
You and me in unity
[Verse 2]
I will be the heart when the beat stops
Be the light when thе sun drops
I'm hopin' on the stars through the tree tops
That you'll be thеre for me[Chorus]
Will you walk with me down a lonely street?
Talk to me, tell me what you see
Stand by me so the world will see
You and me in unity
Walk with me down a lonely street
Talk to me, tell me what you see
Stand by me so the world will see
You and me in unity (hey)
Ay yah, ay yah, ay yah
You and me in unity
Ay yah, ay yah, ay yah
You and me in unity
Ay yah, ay yah, ay yah
You and me in unity
Ay yah, ay yah, ay yah
[Bridge]
Save us from this madness
Heal us from this sadness
Lead us to what matters
Closer to You
Save us from this madness
Heal us from this sadness
Lead us to what matters
Closer to You[Chorus]
Will you walk with me down a lonely street?
Talk to me, tell me what you see
Stand by me so the world will see
You and me in unity
Walk with me down a lonely street
Talk to me, tell me what you see
Stand by me so the world will see
You and me in unity
Ay yah, ay yah, ay yah
You and me in unity
Ay yah, ay yah, ay yah
You and me in unity
Ay yah, ay yah, ay yah
You and me in unity
Ay yah, ay yah, ay yah
Do you believe in unity?
