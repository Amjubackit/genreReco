[Verse 1]
Come out of hiding, You’re safe here with Me
There’s no need to cover what I already see
You’ve got your reasons, but I hold your peace
You’ve been on lockdown, and I hold the key
[Chorus]
‘Cause I loved you before you knew what was love
I saw it all, still I chose the cross
You were the one that I was thinking of
When I rose from the grave
Now rid of the shackles, My victory is yours
I tore the veil for you to come close
There’s no reason to stand at a distance anymore
You’re not far from home
[Verse 2]
And I’ll be your lighthouse when you’re lost at sea
I will illuminate everything
No need to be frightened by intimacy
No, just throw off your fear and come running to Me
[Chorus]
Oh, 'cause I loved you before you knew what was love
I saw it all, still I chose the cross
And you were the one that I was thinking of
When I rose from the grave
Now rid of the shackles, My victory is yours
I tore the veil for you to come close
There’s no reason to stand at a distance anymore
You’re not far from home
