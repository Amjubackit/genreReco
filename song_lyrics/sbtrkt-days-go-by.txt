[Verse 1: Toro Y Moi]
I called just to see if you could still go out
Nothin' was open so we just stayed in
Go out for a drive around midnight
Saturday mornin', steady creepin'
[Chorus: Toro Y Moi]
Oh, how the day goes by
I wish I understood
Oh, how the day goes by
Last night, all the questions you were askin' got me thinkin'
Is this just an open book and we can't help but read it? (I wish I understood)
[Verse 2: Toro Y Moi]
I know some who say they are romantics
Ending up exactly where they started
Twenty-one messages left to be read
Funny how some can be misguided
[Chorus: Toro Y Moi]
Oh, how the day goes by
I wish I understood
Oh, how thе day goes by
Last night, all the questions you wеre askin' got me thinkin'
Is this just an open book and we can't help but read it? (I wish I understood)
[Post-Chorus: Toro Y Moi]
Last night, all the questions you were askin' got me thinkin'
Is this just an open book and we can't help but read it?
Last night, all the questions you were askin' got me thinkin'
Is this just an open book and we can't help but read it?
[Chorus: Toro Y Moi]
Oh, how the day goes by
I wish I understood
Oh, how the day goes by
I wish I understood
