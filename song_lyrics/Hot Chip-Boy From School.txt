Verse 1
]
And I was a 
boy from school
Helplessly helping all the rules
And there was a boy at school
Hopelessly wrestling all his fools
And there was a girl at school
Blaming all the words she learned from home
Nothing could keep her a child
Long hours, don't you know we tried?
[Chorus]
We tried, but we didn't have long
We tried, but we don't belong
We tried, but we didn't have long
We tried, but we don't belong
[
Verse 2
]
Now I met you on the street
Heartlessly breaking rules, we meet
Lives are found and loves are lost
Say goodbye to nothing everything caused
Now I find you on the street
Breaking rules, hopelessly we meet
Lives are found but loves are lost
Say goodbye to everything, nothing 
caused
