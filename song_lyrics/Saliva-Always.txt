[Verse 1]
I hear a voice say, "Don't be so blind"
It's telling me all these things
That you would probably hide
Am I your one and only desire?
Am I the reason you breathe?
Or am I the reason you cry?
[Pre-Chorus]
Always, always, always, always, always, always
I just can't live without you
[Chorus]
I love you, I hate you
I can't get around you
I breathe you, I taste you
I can't live without you
I just can't take any more
This life of solitude
I guess that I'm out the door
And now I'm done with you
(Done with you, done with you, done with you, done with you, done with you)
[Verse 2]
I feel like you don't want me around
I guess I'll pack all my things
I guess I'll see you around
It's all been bottled up until now
As I walk out your door
All I can hear is the sound
