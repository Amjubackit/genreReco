[Verse 1: Aodhan King]
Standing here in Your presence
In a grace so relentless
I am won
By perfect love
Wrapped within the arms of heaven
In a peace that lasts forever
Sinking deep
In mercy's sea
[Chorus: Aodhan King]
I'm wide awake
Drawing close
Stirred by grace
All my heart is Yours
All fear removed
I breathe You in
I lean into Your love
Your love
[Verse 2: Aodhan King]
When I'm lost You pursue me
Lift my head to see Your glory
Lord of all
So beautiful
Here in You I find shelter
Captivated by the splendour
Of Your face
My secret place
[Chorus: Aodhan King]
I'm wide awake
Drawing close
Stirred by grace
All my heart is Yours
All fear removed
I breathe You in
I lean into Your love
Oh, Your love
[Bridge: Aodhan King]
Your love so deep
Is washing over me
Your face is all I seek
You are my everything
Jesus Christ
You are my one desire
Lord hear my only cry
To know You all my life
Your love so deep
Is washing over me
Your face is all I seek
You are my everything
Jesus Christ
You are my one desire
Lord hear my only cry
To know You all my life
[Chorus: Aodhan King]
I'm wide awake
Drawing close
Stirred by grace
All my heart is Yours
All fear removed
I breathe You in
I lean into Your love
Oh, Your love
