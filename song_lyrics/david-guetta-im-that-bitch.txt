[Intro]
Icy, Icy, Icy, Icy
[Verse 1]
I pull up, bet you see them faces shift
Bust in looking like a couple GIF
Brrt, brrt, kill a scene, I make it quick
Brrt, brrt, hustle back, take a pic
Lookin' in your eyes, I see your fear
But you can't see me, though, I'm in the air
Boss bitch, y'all should call me Jefe
I'm known from Miami back to L.A
[Chorus]
I'm that bitch, I'm that bitch
I'm that, I'm that, I'm that
I'm that bitch, I'm that bitch
I'm that, I'm that, I'm that
I'm that bitch, I'm that bitch
I'm that, I'm that, I'm that
I'm that bitch, I'm that bitch
I'm that, I'm that, I'm that
[Beat Drop]
Bitch!
I'm that, I'm that
I'm that bi-bi-bi-bitch[Verse 2]
I don't ask for forgiveness or permission
If I want it, I'ma fucking go get it
On the court all by myself, no competition
Y'all be giving me advice, I never listen
Uh, I'm the biggest boss
Uh, I be spillin' sauce
Uh, I've got no pain, no fallin'-off
Uh, y'all niggas too soft
[Chorus]
I'm that bitch, I'm that bitch
I'm that, I'm that, I'm that
I'm that bitch, I'm that bitch
I'm that, I'm that, I'm that
I'm that bitch, I'm that bitch
I'm that, I'm that, I'm that
I'm that bitch, I'm that bitch
I'm that, I'm that, I'm that
Bitch
[Beat Drop]
Bitch!
I'm that, I'm that
[Bridge]
Bitch, I'm the biggest boss
Uh, I be spillin' sauce
Uh, I've got no pain, no fallin'-off
Uh, y'all niggas too soft
Bitch, I'm the biggest boss
Uh, I be spillin' sauce
Uh, I've got no pain, no fallin'-off
Uh, y'all niggas too soft[Interlude]
Icy, Icy, Icy, Icy
[Chorus]
I'm that bitch, I'm that bitch
I'm that, I'm that, I'm that
