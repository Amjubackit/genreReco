[Intro]
Do-do-do-do-do-oo-oo-oo-oo
Bah-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-dah
[Verse 1]
Didn't I treat you right, now? (Didn't I?)
Didn't I do the best I could, 'n I? (Didn't I?)
Didn't I give ya everything? (Didn't I?)
I tried my best just to be a man, 'n I (Didn't I?)
[Chorus]
Didn't I do it, baby?
Didn't I do right?
Why you wanna leave me, baby? 'N I
Didn't I treat you right?
[Verse 2]
I bought you diamond rings
Everything, that a woman could need
I bought you cars, clothes, a home
When things were rough for me I kept on
And I am back again
[Hook]
Didn't I?
Didn't I?
Didn't I?
Didn't I?
[Verse 3]
There's something wrong with you
Tell me
Bring me all your troubles dear
You look bad, you should be glad
Your leading man, always be glad, sit by home
And let me kiss your lovely lips
[Chorus]
Didn't I do it, baby? 'N I
Didn't I do right?
Why you wanna leave me baby? Eh-Uh
I said didn't I treat you right
[Verse 4]
It's a mystery to me
That you won't
Talk to me
What it is that I've done
To make me...
