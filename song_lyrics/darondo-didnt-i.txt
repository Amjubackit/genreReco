[Intro]
Do-do-do-do-do-oo-oo-oo-oo
Bah-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-dah
[Verse 1]
Didn't I treat you right, now? (Didn't I?)
Didn't I do the best I could, 'n I? (Didn't I?)
Didn't I give ya everything? (Didn't I?)
I tried my best just to be a man, 'n I (Didn't I?)
[Chorus]
Didn't I do it, baby?
Didn't I do right?
Why you wanna leave me, baby? 'N I
Didn't I treat you right?
[Verse 2]
I bought you diamond rings
Everything, that a woman could need
I bought you cars, clothes, a home
When things were rough for me I kept on
And I am back again
[Hook]
Didn't I?
Didn't I?
