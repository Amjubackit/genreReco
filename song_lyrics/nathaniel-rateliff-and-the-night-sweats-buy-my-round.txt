[Intro]
Do, do, do, do-do-do, do-do
Do-do-do, do-do-do, do
Do-do-do, do-do-do, do
Do, do, do, do-do-do, do-do
Do-do-do, do-do-do, do
Do-do-do, do-do-do, do
[Verse 1]
When you wake and find the morning
Do you even know your name?
I saw you took a break from living
And now I'm feeling just the same
[Refrain]
Do, do, do, do-do-do, do-do
Do-do-do, do-do-do, do
Do-do-do, do-do-do, do
[Verse 2]
Can I get with you tomorrow?
In the sunlight of the day
And tell each other all we wanted
Until there’s nothing left to say
[Chorus]
We're gonna win this round, this round, this round
We're gonna skip this town, this town, this town
Buy my round, my round, my round on me
And all this time, this time, this time
And nothing to find, to find, to find
When all I really wanted was to see you[Bridge]
It’s been years since we were young, dear
I'm aware of where I stand
When all the timе we had is dust in the wind
If I had the opportunity
To tеll you what you mean to me
And all that I could say is, "I am"
[Refrain]
Do, do, do, do-do-do, do-do
Do-do-do, do-do-do, do
Do-do-do, do-do-do, do
Do, do, do, do-do-do, do-do
Do-do-do, do-do-do, do
Do-do-do, do-do-do, do
[Chorus]
We're gonna win this round, this round, this round
We're gonna skip this town, this town, this town
Buy my round, my round, my round on me
And all this time, this time, this time
And nothing to find, to find, to find
When all I really wanted was to see you
[Outro]
We're gonna win this round, this round, this round
'Cause you're welcomed back again
We're gonna get it right, get it right for you and me
And all this time, this time, this time
And nothing to find, to find, to find
When all I really wanted was
When all I really wanted was to see you
