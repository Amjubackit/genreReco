[Chorus]
Something about the name Jesus
Something about the name Jesus
It is the sweetest name I know
Oh how I love the name Jesus
Oh how I love the name Jesus
It is the sweetest name I know
[Verse 1]
Some people say I'm crazy but
I can't explain
The power that I feel
When I call Your name
It's just like fire
Shut up in my bones
The Holy Ghost is movin
And it just won't leave me alone
[Chorus]
Something about the name Jesus
Something about the name Jesus
It is the sweetest name I know
Oh how I love the name Jesus
Oh how I love the name Jesus
It is the sweetest name I know[Verse 2]
Sweeter than honey
From the honeycomb
I can feel the Holy Ghost movin
It won't leave me alone
At the name of Jesus
Every knee has got to bow
You don't have to wait until the fire comes
You can go on and shout and praise Him right now
[Chorus]
Something about the name Jesus
Something about the name Jesus
It is the sweetest name I know
Oh how I love the name Jesus
Oh how I love the name Jesus
It is the sweetest name I know
[Bridge]
I know, I know, I know, I know
[Outro]
Something about the name Jesus
Something about the name Jesus
It is the sweetest name I know
Oh how I love the name Jesus
Oh how I love the name Jesus
It is the sweetest name I know
