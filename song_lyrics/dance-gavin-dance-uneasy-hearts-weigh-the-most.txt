[Verse 1: Kurt Travis]
To feel her touch
It's almost impossible to hold still
Maybe we can go back to the way it was
Well, at least let me love you the same
[Chorus 1: Kurt Travis, Jon Mess, & Nic Newsham]
I've got lies to tell your children
When my smile pierces through your bones
Right through your bones (Through your bones)
The grass is green inside my yard
I can make you laugh so fucking hard
It hurts you inside your bones (Inside your bones)
[Verse 2: Nic Newsham]
When she talks, I listen
She's in the shower and her skin glistens
Like, oh my god, I like it
Like, oh, oh god, I like it
I suggest a drive, let's take the backroad
Let's get lost, let's lose our minds
Hey, little girl, I think we found it tonight
I think we glow that fucking bright, oh
And when she laughs I like it
Like oh-ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
[Chorus 1: Kurt Travis, Jon Mess, & Nic Newsham]
I've got lies to tell your children
When my smile pierces through your bones
Right through your bones (Through your bones)
The grass is green inside my yard
I can make you laugh so fucking hard
It hurts you inside your bones (Inside your bones)
[Chorus 2: Nic Newsham, Kurt Travis]
Holy shit, she smells like heaven
Been best friends since we were eleven
And oh my god, I like her
Yeah, I heard you like her
Baby, I thought that we had something
Compared to him I'm next to nothing
And, oh my god, I like her
Yeah, I heard you like her
[Bridge: Jon Mess]
I am a million fucking bucks
I am a thousand fucking fucks
Your bitch is dead, she was hit by a truck
What the fuck?
[Chorus 2: Nic Newsham, Kurt Travis]
Holy shit, she smells like heaven
Been best friends since we were eleven
Oh my god, I like her
Yeah, I heard you like her
Baby, I thought that we had something
Compared to him I'm next to nothing
And, oh my god, I like her
Yeah, I heard you like her
