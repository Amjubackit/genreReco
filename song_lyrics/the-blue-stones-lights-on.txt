[Verse 1]
I saw it from a distance
It came without a sound
I couldn't shake the monster
I couldn't even out, and I say, "Goddamn
You take my plans and then you turn them into ghosts"
[Chorus]
Bend a little, won't break now
Hold in the middle, won't shake now
Been holding darkness too long (Whoa)
Turn the lights on
And when it comes to an end
I'll do it over again, over again
[Verse 2]
Been fighting off a monster
Since I was twenty-one
But I keep drawing parallels, so I drop gloves and let 'em come
And everyone I know has someone else they'd rather be
And I feel lost 'causе I choose me
[Chorus]
Bend a littlе, won't break now
Hold in the middle, won't shake now
Been holding darkness too long (Whoa)
Turn the lights on
And when it comes to an end
I'll do it over again, over again[Chorus]
Bend a little, won't break now
Hold in the middle, won't shake now
Been holding darkness too long (Whoa)
Turn the li-lights on
And when it comes to an end
I'll do it over again, over again
I'll do it over again
