[Verse 1: Scott Woodruff]
Small world we're livin' in, rock set in stone
One life I've been livin' in, come on let's go
[Chorus: Scott Woodruff](x2)
I wanna get high, I wanna get low
Come on, I wanna smoke a little spliff with you
[Verse 2: Scott Woodruff]
Lord knows I'm not a fool, I'm just crazy for you
I can feel it in the way things go, lord what I'd do
[Chorus: Scott Woodruff](x2)
I wanna get high, I wanna get low
Come on, I wanna smoke a little spliff with you
[Refrain: Collie Buddz](x2)
Smokin', smokin' love
[Verse 3: Collie Buddz]
Well everything is alright girl
Well you know when I'm smokin’ with you
Let's spend a little time inside, roll it up
Girl, you know what to do
I wanna get high over the moon
On the left side, pass it over to you
On the low, well everything is alright girl
Well you know when I'm smokin’ with you
Give me that good high grade, that Bob Marley strain
Will make you feel no pain, you know
The smoke'a fill me brain, this is some high octane
You know me not gonna change, you know
Let's sip some good champagne and puff some kush champagne
I hope you feel the same, you know
And girl don’t play no games because know what I'm talking about
I wanna get high, baby lets go
Come on, I wanna smoke a big spliff with you
I wanna get high, baby lets go
Come on, I wanna smoke a big spliff with you cuz you're my...[Refrain: Collie Buddz](x2)
Smokin', smokin' love
[Bridge: Scott Woodruff]
I wanna be alone with you and get all stoned
I wanna go home with you and get let alone
[Chorus: Scott Woodruff](x2)
I wanna get high, I wanna get low
Come on, I wanna smoke a little spliff with you
[Outro: Collie Buddz]
Smokin' love
