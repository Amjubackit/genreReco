You damn right, I've got the blues
From my head down to my shoes
You damn right, I've got the blues
From my head down to my shoes
I can't win, 'cause I don't have a thing to lose
I stopped by my daughters house
You know I just want to use the phone
I stopped by my daughters house
You know I just want to use the phone
You know my new grand baby came to the door
And said, granddaddy you know ain't no one at home
I said now look out
You damn right, I've got the blues
From my head down to my shoes
You damn right, I've got the blues
From my head down to my shoes
You know I can't win, now, people
'Cause I don't have a thing to lose
Alright
You damn right, I've got the blues
You damn right, I've got the blues
You damn right, I've got the blues
You damn right, I've got the blues
Yeah
