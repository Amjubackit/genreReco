[Verse 1]
Help me, if you can
It's just that this
Is not the way I'm wired, so, could you please
Help me understand why
You've given in to all these
Reckless dark desires? You're
[Pre-Chorus]
Lying to yourself again, suicidal imbecile
Think about it, you're pounding on a fault line
What'll it take to get it through to you, precious?
I'm over this, why do you wanna throw it away like this?
Such a mess, why would I wanna watch you?
[Chorus]
Disconnect and self-destruct
One bullet at a time
What's your rush, now?
Everyone will have his day to die
[Verse 2]
Medicated, drama queen
Picture-perfect, numb belligerence
Narcissistic, drama queen
Craving fame and all its decadence[Pre-Chorus]
Lying through your teeth again, suicidal imbecile
Think about it, you're pounding on a fault line
What'll it take to get it through to you, precious?
I'm over this, why do you wanna throw it away like this?
Such a mess, why would I wanna watch you?
[Chorus]
Disconnect and self-destruct
One bullet at a time
What's your rush, now?
Everyone will have his day to die
[Bridge]
They were right about you
They were right about you
[Pre-Chorus]
Lying to my face again, suicidal imbecile
Think about it, you're pounding on a fault line
What'll it take to get it through to you, precious?
I'm over this, why do you wanna throw it away like this?
Such a mess, over this, over this
[Chorus]
Disconnect and self-destruct
One bullet at a time
What's your hurry?
Everyone will have his day to die
If you choose to pull the trigger
Should your drama prove sincere
Do it somewhere far away from here
