[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
When I pretend everything is what I want it to be
I look exactly like what you had always wanted to see
When I pretend, I can forget about the criminal I am
Stealin' second after second just 'cause I know I can, but
[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda & 
Chester Bennington
]
I can't pretend this is the way it'll stay
I'm just 
trying to bend the truth
I can't pretend I'm who you want me to be
So I'm 
lying my way from
[Chorus: Mike Shinoda & 
Chester Bennington
]
You
(No, no turning back now)
I wanna be pushed aside, so let me go
(No, no turning back now)
Let me take back my life, I'd rather be all alone
(No turning back now)
Anywhere on my own, 'cause I can see
(No, no turning back now)
The very worst part of you is me
[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
I remember what they taught to me
Remember condescending talk of who I oughta be
Remember listenin' to all of that and this again
So I pretended up a person who was fittin' in
