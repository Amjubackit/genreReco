[Verse]
Lead me, Lord, lead me
Keep me, oh, keep me
From wandering
Help me, Lord, help me
Teach me, oh, teach me
Your suffering
[Chorus]
I will walk the narrow way
The only road that will lead to life
And I will stay the narrow way
To see the face of the One I love
[Verse]
Lead me, Lord, lead me
Keep me, oh, keep me
From wandering
Help me, Lord, help me
Teach me, oh, teach me
Your suffering
[Chorus]
And I will walk the narrow way
The only road that will lead to life
And I will stay the narrow way
To see the face of the One I love
The One I love
