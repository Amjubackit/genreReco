[Verse 1]
Can't stand the fact I know where you are
Ten years, I still try to spot your car
When driving past your house
The taste of iron in my mouth, or
[Verse 2]
The shame that I have to look like mom
Disgraced, I made me my father's son
You're still too close to me
I swear at night I feel you breathe
[Chorus]
There's nothing special in the water here
There's no reason you should feel the need to stay
You've ruined everything you touched 'round here
Lеt the locusts have your home
Thеy'll feel the same
And I'll feel the same
[Refrain]
Re-check
Change
Re-check
Change[Bridge: Tades and 
Chris
]
You're tired at roll call
You should learn to play hooky for me
It's total recall
I can hear how you cried when it came time to leave
[Refrain]
Re-check
Change
Re-check
[Chorus]
There's nothing special in the water here
There's no reason you should feel the need to stay
You've ruined everything you touched 'round here
Let the locusts have your home
They'll feel the same
And I'll feel the same
I'll feel the same
[Refrain]
Re-check
Change
Re-check
Change
Re-check
Change[Chorus]
There's nothing special in the water here (re-check, change)
There's no reason you should feel the need to stay
You've ruined everything you touched 'round here (re-check, change)
Let the locusts have your home
They'll feel the same
And I'll-
[Outro: Tades and

Color it out
Of your pictures of me
Color it out
Thought I stole every one when we left
Hollow it out
Your house in the weeds
Hollow it out
Hope it sinks into corn fields
