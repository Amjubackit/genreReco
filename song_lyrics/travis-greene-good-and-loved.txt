Through your story is My fingerprint
In the valley there is confidence
In the shadow, I will be your strength
One thing's for sure, I am your Lord
Yes, I am
I am, I am
[Verse 2: Steffany Gretzinger]
Through the chaos, I will be your joy
When you're finished, I have so much more
In the waiting, I'm an open door
Stand still and know, I am your Lord
[Chorus: Steffany Gretzinger]
They'll be times when you're up
And times when you're down
I'm never too far
Just look around and you'll find Me
I'm by your side, arms open wide
I am good, you are loved
Oh, I am good, you are loved
Oh, yes, you are loved, you are loved
