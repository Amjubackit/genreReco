[Verse 1]
Some things look good on paper
Some things are written in the stars
Some stories are worth telling, and then there's ours
Some things look like forever
That picture perfect dream come true
Some people make you better, and then there's you
[Chorus]
I guess it is what it is
Wrong place, wrong time
But I couldn't resist those night time white lies
Stuck on your lips, you were my heaven sent
Now if I never see you again
I guess it is what it is
False hope broke me like I'm something to fix
Road-trip type love
Then we drove off a cliff, you were my heaven sent
Now if I never see you again
I guess it is what it is
[Verse 2]
I gotta hand it to you
You play the victim all too well
It's hard to know you're lying, when you're lying to yourself
Look, the tears won't work, you won't find those words
That'll ever fix my heart
'Cause the day I fell for you, is the day I fell apart
[Chorus]
I guess it is what it is
Wrong place, wrong time
But I couldn't resist those night time white lies
Stuck on your lips, you were my heaven sent
Now if I never see you again
I guess it is what it is
False hope broke me like I'm something to fix
Road-trip type love
Then we drove off a cliff, you were my heaven sent
Now if I never see you again
I guess it is what it is
I guess it is what it is
Wrong place, wrong time
But I couldn't resist those night time white lies
Stuck on your lips, you were my heaven sent
Now if I never see you again
I guess it is what it is
False hope broke me like I'm something to fix
Road-trip type love
Then we drove off a cliff, you were my heaven sent
Now if I never see you again
I guess it is what it is
