[Chorus]
Ooh, one to remember
Writing it down now
So we won't forget
Ooh, never enough paper
Never enough letters
So we won't forget
[Verse]
Call me what you want
Call me what you need
Words don't have to say
Keep it to myself
[Chorus]
Ooh, every minute
Every hour
So we won't forget
You don't have to be silent
Say to remind me
So we won't forget
Ooh
[Bridge]
Call me what you want
Call me what you need
Words don't have to say
Keep it to myself
Call me what you want
Call me what you need
Words don't have to say
Keep it to myself[Chorus]
Ooh, one to remember
Writing it down now
So we won't forget
Ooh, never enough paper
Never enough letters
So we won't forget
Ooh, every minute
Every hour
So we won't forget
You don't have to be silent
Say to remind me
So we won't forget
[Interlude]
[Chorus]
Ooh, one to remember
Writing it down now
So we won't forget
Ooh, never enough paper
Never enough letters
So we won't forget
Ooh, every minute
Every hour
So we won't forget
You don't have to be silent
Say to remind me
So we won't forget
Ooh[Outro]
Ooh, say you remember
For I think I've lost it
