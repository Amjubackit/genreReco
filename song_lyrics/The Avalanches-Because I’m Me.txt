[Chorus: Six Boys in Trouble]
If she don't love me
What can I do?
Just put on my best pair of shoes
Because, oh, I'm me
Because she said, "He's the one
That drill the charms
Honey, that's so wrong"
I just want to know what's wrong with me
Being in love with you?
(Yeah)
(Hey, Frank!)
[Verse 1: Sonny Cheeba]
Yeah
Ninth grade had the jingles of the swinging rainbow jacket
Lost lingo, Bronx's only Django
Snap, he'd got less tougher
That's where my props go
That's where my pops went
See, my percentage is a pennant to the planet
Knock it out the ball park, Frankie
I should not tire this tire
To a better love, let the wings spread
It'll always come back, baby
Come back, 
shellac black,
 baby
A comeback, flat black paint on a Chevy
