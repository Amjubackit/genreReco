[Verse 1]
Perfect child
Plugged in since the womb
Prophet of the dune
In this electric tomb
Man has made
An omnipresent force
Heading on a course
For interstellar shores
[Verse 2]
God machine
Malfunctioned as it grew
And the circuits blew
Falling down on you
Now you're free
Unplug from the source
No more underscores
Open up the doors
[Chorus]
Feeling
Oh God, the feeling
We need some healing
We need some healing
God knows if you feel defeated
You have been cheated
You have retreated
