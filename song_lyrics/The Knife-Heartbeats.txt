[Verse 1]
One night to be confused
One night to speed up truth
We had a promise made
Four hands and then away
Both under influence
We had divine sense
To know what to say
Mind is a razor-blade
[Chorus]
To call for hands of above, to lean on
Wouldn't be good enough for me
[Verse 2]
One night of magic rush
The start: a simple touch
One night to push and scream
And then relief
Ten days of perfect tunes
The colors red and blue
We had a promise made
We were in love
[Chorus]
To call for hands of above, to lean on
Wouldn't be good enough for me
To call for hands of above, to lean on
Wouldn't be good enough for me
