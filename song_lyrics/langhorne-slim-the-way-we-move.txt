There we are, extending into shooting stars
In our houses, in our cars
You didn't know it, now you do
This is the way we move
In the belly of the whale
In my bedroom, I can't sleep
Well, all my friends got crooked tails
That's the way I like it
That's just what I need
And here we are, extending into shooting stars
In our houses, in our cars
You didn't know it, now you do
This is the way (this is the way) we move
In the belly of the whale
In my bedroom, I can't sleep
And all my friends got crooked tails
That's the way I like it
That's the company I keep
And there we are, extending into shooting stars
In our houses, ashes to bars
You didn't know it, now you do
This happens to be the way we moveIn the belly of the whale
In the belly of the beast
At the last supper, honey
Make sure you get something, something to eat
And there we are, extending into shooting stars
In our houses, in our cars
You didn't know it, now you do
This is the way (this is the way) we move
