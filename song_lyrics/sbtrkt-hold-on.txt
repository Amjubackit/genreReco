[Intro: Sampha]
Oh Oh, Oh Oh, Oh Oh
Oh Oh, Oh, Oh
[Verse 1: Sampha]
How'd you mean?, What do you mean you're not coming by?
I called you later and you were outside
It always screams screams inside my head
Curtains closed you'd be beside my head
You were always down for it
Get in this getaway and we run from it
Yeah, you were always down for it
Get in this getaway and we run from it
[Hook: Sampha]
You're giving me the coldest stare
Like you don't even know I'm here
Why don't we turn the leaf? Why don't we turn the
Why don't we turn the leaf? Why don't we turn the
You're giving me the coldest stare
Like you don't even know I'm here
Why don't we turn the leaf? Why don't we turn the
Why don't we turn the leaf? Why don't we turn the
[Verse 2: Sampha]
What you've done, what you've done you can't keep inside
By the end of the night I'll help you confide
Cause I can see, see your sad self
Cause I can see you're not being yourself
Cause usually you're down for it
Can't hold back a smile when you try for it
Yeah, cause usually you're down for it
Can't hold back a smile when you try for it
[Hook: Sampha]
You're giving me the coldest stare
Like you don't even know I'm here
Why don't you let me sing? Why don't you let me
Why don't you let me sing? Why don't you let me
You're giving me the coldest stare
Like you don't even know I'm here
Why don't you let me sing? Why don't you let me
Why don't you let me sing? Why don't you let me
Whatever done, However bad, Hold on hold on hold on
Whatever done, However bad, Hold on hold on hold on
Whatever it is, However bad, Hold on hold on hold on
Hold on hold on hold on, hold on hold on hold on
[Outro: Sampha]
Why don't...
Why don't...
Why don't...
