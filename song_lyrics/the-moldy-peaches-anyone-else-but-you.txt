[Verse 1: Kimya Dawson]
You're a part-time lover and a full-time friend
The monkey on your back is the latest trend
I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else
But you
[Verse 2: Adam Green]
I kiss you on the brain in the shadow of a train
I kiss you all starry-eyed, my body's swinging from side to side
I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else
But you
[Verse 3: Kimya Dawson]
Here is the church and here is the steeple
We sure are cute for two ugly people
I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else
But you
[Verse 4: Adam Green]
The pebbles forgive me, the trees forgive me
So why can't, you forgive me?
I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else
But you
[Verse 5: Kimya Dawson]
I will find my niche in your car
With my MP3 DVD rumble-packed guitar
I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else
But you
[Hook: Kimya Dawson & Adam Green]
Du du du du du du du du
Du du du du du du du du
Du du du du du du du du du
[Verse 6: Kimya Dawson]
Up up down down left right left right B A Start
Just because we use cheats doesn't mean we're not smart
I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else
But you
[Verse 7: Adam Green]
You are always trying to keep it real
I'm in love with how you feel
I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else
But you
[Verse 8: Kimya Dawson]
We both have shiny happy fits of rage
You want more fans, I want more stage
I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else
But you
[Verse 9: Adam Green]
Don Quixote was a steel-driving man
My name is Adam, I'm your biggest fan
I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else
But you
[Verse 10: Kimya Dawson]
Squinched-up your face and did a dance
You shook a little turd out of the bottom of your pants
I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else
But you
[Outro: Adam Green & Kimya Dawson]
Du du du du du du du du
Du du du du du du du du
Du du du du du du du du du
But you
