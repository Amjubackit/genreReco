[Verse 1]
You know I can't eat without you
And I can't sleep without you
Stay up all night, writing songs about you
Take me on
And I spend all my days drinking
So I don’t have to spend them thinking
And I know that I won't last long this way
[Chorus]
Oh, you got me walking ten miles high
Step off, see if I can fly
[Verse 2]
And my best guess, is too far off
And in my chest, the rhythm's gone
And all of the rest, falls to the side
I sit alone in an empty house
Writing notes what I'm thinking 'bout
The few folks, I didn’t let down
[Chorus]
Oh, you got me walking ten miles high
Step off, see if I can fly
Don’t care if I live or die, don’t care if I live or die
