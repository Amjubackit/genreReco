[Verse 1]
I ain’t rich, but I damn sure wanna be
Working like a dog all day,
 ain’t working for me
I wish I had a rich uncle that’d kick the bucket
And that I was sitting on a pile like Warren Buffett
I know everybody says
Money can’t buy happiness
[Chorus]
But it could buy me a boat, it could buy me a truck to pull it
It could buy me a Yeti 110 iced down
 with some 
silver bullets
Yeah, and I know what they say
Money can’t buy everything
Well, maybe so
But it could buy me a boat
[Verse 2]
They call me redneck, white trash and blue collar
But I could change all that if I had a couple million dollars
I keep hearing that money is the root of all evil
And you can’t fit a camel through the eye of a needle
I’m sure that’s probably true
But it still sounds pretty cool
[Chorus]
‘Cause it could buy me a boat, it could buy me a truck to pull it
It could buy me a Yeti 110 iced down with some silver bullets
Yeah, and I know what they say
Money can’t buy everything
Well, maybe so
But it could buy me a boat
