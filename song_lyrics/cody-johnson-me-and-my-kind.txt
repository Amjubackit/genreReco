[Verse 1]
Yeah that's my old girlfriend
Saw her when she walked in
Her hair's a little longer but she's still lookin' stronger than sin
No I don't care if you buy her a drink
But she's not the kind of girl you'd think
Oh 'cause back when we were lovin'
She thought cowboys were something
Now they ain't
[Chorus]
'Cause she's over buckles
She's over spurs
To her, you're just a heartache in a pearl snap shirt
Been lassoed and let go for the last time
No she ain't just over me
She's over me and my kind
[Verse 2]
I guess I ruined it for the rest of us
When I left her standing in my dust
Oh and lately she's been hating rodeos and Copenhagen
And trucks, ha
[Chorus]
Yeah, she's over buckles
She's over spurs
To her, you're just a heartache in a pearl snap shirt
Been lassoed and let go for the first time
No she ain't just over me
She's over me and my kind
