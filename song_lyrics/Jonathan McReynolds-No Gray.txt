[Intro]
Yeah I wrote this song
And I pray that you listen to all the words
'Cause I feel like at some point in everybody's life

[Verse 1]

But I got to stay cool, too
And no, I'm not a fool
I know eventually I'm gonna have to choose
And, really I don't wanna lose

And a chance to be used by You
[Pre-Chorus]
And if it's God that I'm after
I just can't serve two masters
And before something happens
I gotta turn it all around
Because I know
