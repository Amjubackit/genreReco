[Verse 1]
Over in our glasshouses
Making hot air rise
For all this time
Now it rains inside
[Verse 2]
All the unheard voices
Quietly taking aim
Write their lives
On the windowpanes
[Verse 1]
Over in our glasshouses
Making hot air rise
All this time
Now it rains inside
[Verse 2]
All the unheard voices
Quietly taking aim
Write their lives
On the windowpanes
[Outro]
Yeah?
