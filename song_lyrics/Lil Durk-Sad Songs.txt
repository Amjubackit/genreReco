[Intro: Lil Durk, 
Booka600
]
(
Sittin' and watchin' a Netflix movie on a Saturday
)
Go crazy, I'm textin' her right now
(
Sittin' and watchin', kissin', huggin', fuckin', night and day
)
Nah, for real, I'm textin' her right-right now
This song ain't even supposed to been like that (
TouchofTrent be wildin' with it
)
[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
Pretty little thing, you just a pretty little liar
Got on Pretty Little Thing, Van Cleef bracelet cost four thousand dollars
Appreciate the lil' thing if it came from public housin'
Eighteen million for one tour, I'm so humble, ain't even announce it
I like high-end restaurants, when I read the menu, I can't pronounce it
I went toxic for two months, I showed the streets I don't need cancer
Evеr since we had car sex, shе don't ever wanna wear panties
She like shoppin' on FarFetch, got me watchin' out for her package
I was hard for so long, asked did I pop viagra
I ain't send you home in an Uber, baby, I actually gave you my driver
Had a model kissin' on the street bitch, but I'ma keep it between my family
I'm cummin', she keep on suckin', I told her to stop, she grab my diamond
I know how it feel to be lied on
This ain't gangster shit in my headphones, this a sad song
I can't vent to you on a text message, it's read wrong
He talkin' to one of the most famous girls on my man's phone
[Pre-Chorus: Booka600]
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry
I can't say sorry enough
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
I can't say it enough
