[Verse 1]
I kinda miss you
Back in high school
Twenty-five and I still think about your drawings that you made
I kinda miss you
But I can't talk to you
'Cause in my mind the only thing that I could do now is intrude
[Chorus]
I've got a ring I think that she'd love you too
But I can't get past the fact I drag almost everyone down
[Verse 2]
I didn't think I'd say I
Wanna see you
I won't reach out to you
After all this time I'd imagine I don't fit into your view
Frozen drives from Rocky Horror outgrown
Lofty plans and failing class aside you'd
Find me in the margins of a sketchbook
Probably best to let the memory die out
[Chorus]
I've got a ring I think that she'd love you too
But I can't get past the fact I drag almost everyone down
Painting the walls that lined the hall after school
Smokе and tattoos, five years removеd
Hope you'd recognize me now
[Bridge]
I don't even know who you are
Memories faded out just like a dark room lesson
Clarity lost on resin
Maybe I'm just thinking too hard
Rather let it dissipate than face my conscience
Call it faking progress
[Chorus]
I've got a ring I think that she'd love you too
But I can't get past the fact I drag almost everyone down
Painting the walls that lined the hall after school
Smoke and tattoos, five years removed
Hope you'd recognize me now
[Outro]
I kinda miss you
