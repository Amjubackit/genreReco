I feel a heat inside my bones
I'll grow with my last breath
Aching for clarity
I never jumped into the water
Never took that vital plunge
Still live my life that way
Disregard my only one
I said I'm running outta time
This ain't love this ain't love
I got living on my mind
I'm above, I'm above
Used narrowed lens to trace the paths I laid
And I used to feel it too
Now I'm further from that life
I'm above, I'm above
I'm not looking for any kind of comfort
I'm not looking for much
I'm just riding it out
Where do I turn off the cynic in me?
I am the present, I'm planting my feet
I'll let my mind sublime
I'll let my heart sublime
