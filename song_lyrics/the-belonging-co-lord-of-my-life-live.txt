[Verse 1: Andrew Holt]
All of my steps are ordered by You
You give every breath that I take
And only a kind God gives power to choose
So it is my privilege to say
[Chorus: Andrew Holt]
You are the Lord
You're the Lord of my life
Yes, You are the Lord
You're the Lord of my life
Jesus Christ
[Verse 2: Andrew Holt]
Though I may stumble, I will not fall
For I am upheld by Your hand
And even in trial, I'll count it as joy
To say it again and again
[Chorus: Andrew Holt]
That You are the Lord
You're the Lord of my life
You are the Lord
You're the Lord of my life
Jesus Christ
You are, You are the Lord
You're the Lord of my life
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
You are the Lord
You're the Lord of my life
Jesus Christ, oh[Interlude: Andrew Holt]
You're the Lord
The King of Kings
Lord over it all, Lord over it all
Let all else fade away, let all else fade away
[Bridge: Andrew Holt]
Every knee will bow, every tongue confess
But it's my joy to do it now, Lord Jesus
Every eye will see You in Your glory
But I get to seek You now, Lord Jesus
Every knee will bow, every tongue confess
But it's my joy to do it now, Lord Jesus
Every eye will see You in Your glory
But I get to seek You now, Lord Jesus
And there will be a day, tears will be no more
The angels and the saints will worship and adore
I'll enter Heaven's gates, forever sing Your name
But I get to sing it now, Lord Jesus
Oh Jesus, Yes, I get to sing it now, Lord Jesus
I sing Your name, Jesus
Yes, I get to sing it now
[Chorus: Andrew Holt]
That You are the Lord
You're the Lord of my life
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (You are, You are)
You are the Lord
You're the Lord of my life
Jesus Christ[Bridge: Andrew Holt]
There will be a day tears will be no more
The angels and the saints will worship and adore
I'll enter Heaven's gates, forever sing Your name
But I get to sing it now, Lord Jesus
I lift high Your name, Jesus
Yes, I get to sing it now, Lord Jesus
[?], all praise, all glory to Jesus
Yes, I get to sing it now, Lord Jesus
[Interlude: Andrew Holt]
All praise to You, Jesus
All praise to You, Jesus
The King of kings
The praise is [?], the praise is [?]
[Refrain: Andrew Holt]
Come take Your place, come take Your place
Come take Your place, King Jesus
Come take Your place, come take Your place
Come take Your place, King Jesus
Come take Your place, come take Your place
Come take Your place, King Jesus
Come take Your place, come take Your place
Come take Your place, King Jesus
Hey[Instrumental]
[Outro: Andrew Holt]
You are the Lord
You're the Lord of my life
You are the Lord
You're the Lord of my life
Jesus Christ
