[Verse 1]
Down to you
You're pushin' and pullin' me
Down to you
But I don't know what Iâ€”
[Chorus]
Now when I caught myself
I had to stop myself
From saying something that
I should've never thought
Now when I caught myself
I had to stop myself
From saying something that
I should've never thought of you
Of you
You're pushin' and pullin' me
Down to you
But I don't know what I want
No, I don't know what I want
[Verse 2]
You got it, you got it
Some kind of magic
Hypnotic, hypnotic
You're leaving me breathless
I hate this, I hate this
You're not the one I believe in
With God as my witness[Chorus]
Now when I caught myself
I had to stop myself
From saying something that
I should've never thought
Now when I caught myself
I had to stop myself
From saying something that
I should've never thought of you
Of you
You're pushin' and pullin' me
Down to you
But I don't know what I want
No, I don't know what I want
[Bridge]
Don't know what I want
But I know it's not you
Keep pushin' and pullin' me down
When I know, in my heart, it's not you
[Breakdown]
Ooh
Oh
[Chorus]
Now when I caught myself
I had to stop myself
From saying something that
I should've never thought
Now when I caught myself
I had to stop myself
From saying something that
I should've never thought of you
I knew
I know, in my heart, it's not you
I know
But now, I know what I want
I want
I want[Outro]
Oh, no, I should've never thought
