Not a second
Or another minute
Not an hour
Or another day
But at this moment with my arms outstretched
I need you to make a way
As you have done so many times before
Through a window or an open door
I stretch my hands to you
Come rescue me
I need youâ€¦
Right away
I need you now
I need you now
I need you now
I need you now
Not another second
Or another minute
Not an hour of another day
But Lord I need you right away
If I never needed you before
To show up and restore
All of the faith that I let slip
While I was yet searching the world for more
