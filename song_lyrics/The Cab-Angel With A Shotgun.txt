[Intro]
(Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah)
(Oh yeah, oh yeah) I'm an angel with a shotgun, shotgun, shotgun
(Oh yeah, oh yeah) Angel with a shotgun, shotgun, shotgun
[Verse 1]
Get out your guns, battle's begun
Are you a saint or a sinner?
If love's a fight, then I shall die
With my heart on a trigger
[Pre-Chorus]
They say before you start a war
You better know what you're fighting for
Well baby, you are all that I adore
If love is what you need, a soldier I will be
[Chorus]
I'm an angel with a shotgun, fighting 'til the war's won
I don't care if heaven won't take me back
I'll throw away my faith, babe, just to keep you safe
Don't you know you're everything I have?
And I wanna live, not just survive tonight
[Verse 2]
Sometimes to win, you've got to sin
Don't mean I'm not a believer
And Major Tom will sing along
Yeah, they still say I'm a dreamer
