You could teach me to be cruel
Like the way they torture you
Teach me to be cruel
Like the way they torture you
It's alright
Twist the knife
It's alright
Twist the knife
You disappear, disappear
Into grey, run away, run away
You disappear, disappear
Into grey, run away, run away
You can't let go of the past
When each day feels like your last
We could try to play it straight
Sometimes love feels just like hate
Every time I close my eyes
You twist and turn the knife
You could teach me to be cruel
Like the way they torture you
Teach me to be cruel
Like the way they torture you
