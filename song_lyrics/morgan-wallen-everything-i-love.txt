[Verse 1]
I wish I would've met you anywhere but where I did
Some old high rise town that I won't ever go again
I wish we woulda rolled around In some old cab and chased them city lights
And hit bars I don't like
[Pre-Chorus]
We were listenin' to One More Silver Dollar
Hanging out my Silverado
Down a road I love to ride
[Chorus]
Wish I would've known that by now
You'd be good and gone
And you'd leave us
In a cloud of dust
Can't you see what you're doin', girl?
You ruined damn near everything I love
[Verse 2]
I don't care how much they're bitin'
I won't even crank thе boat
Soon as that bobber hits the water
Girl, your mеmory starts to float
Baby, why'd l ever take the bait
And take you places that I love to go?
Hell, I'll never know
[Pre-Chorus]
I even took you to my hometown to meet my Mama
Now, I'm gonna see you every time
I see that welcome sign
[Chorus]
Wish I would've known that by now
You'd be good and gone
And you'd leave us
In a cloud of dust
Can't you see what you're doin', girl?
You ruined damn near everything I love
[Guitar Solo]
[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna hear One More Silver Dollar
I can't take my Silverado down them roads we used to ride
[Chorus]
Wish I would've known that by now
You'd be good and gone
And you'd leave us
In a cloud of dust
Can't you see what you're doin', girl?
You ruined damn near everything I love
[Chorus]
I can't go nowhere near the whiskey
'Cause you used to drink it with me
In the bed of my truck
And now, I can't get drunk
Can't you see what you're doin', girl?
You ruined damn near everything I love
Can't you see what you're doin', girl?
You ruined damn near everything I love
