[Verse 1]
I wanna be there when the voices in your head
Are loud enough to make you lose your mind
Just the same when you're dominating the day
I wanna be the one who's by your side
[Pre-Chorus]
You know my love is not the jealous type
It doesn't matter if we win or lose
I could stay or I could come
No matter where you're coming from
I could be the one to let you choose
[Chorus]
I wanna hold you close but never hold you back
Just like the banks to the river
And if you ever feel like you are not enough
I'm gonna break all your mirrors
I wanna be there when the darkness closes in
To make the truth a little clearer
I wanna hold you close but never hold you back
I'll be the banks for your river
[Post-Chorus]
I'll be the banks for your river
I'll be the banks for your river
