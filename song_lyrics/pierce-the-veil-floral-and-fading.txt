[Intro]
(Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh-oh-oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
[Verse 1]
Rage in us, your thirst I'm taking
Pull the plug, I'll keep on shaking
And thrustin' about your apartment
Drowned on the blankets, floral and fading, huh
Painful lust, two aching guts
They tear through each other in the mirror
This happy vacation, there's no motivation
To hold me up
[Chorus]
You say you want to chase the moon like fire
Well, together we can fake our own deaths here
Just wanna be alone and watch as you all just disappear
(Whoa-oh-ooh, oh, oh-oh-oh)
[Verse 2]
D-d-d-darker now, kicked out and sleeping in your car
You roll the window down (Oh-oh)
Enough to dream and make-believe
Our lights knocked out, turned upside down
And I'm just a stupid motherfucker, can't figure it out
I want devil horns, I wanna breathe in your rush
I wanna leap when you want me to fly
But darling, I don't mean to beg (Oh-whoa-oh, oh)
But these thorns on the stem are nearly tearing up my skin
[Chorus]
And now you wanna chase the moon like fire
Well, together we can fake our own deaths here
Just wanna be alone and watch as you all just disappear
[Spoken]
Tony!
[Guitar Solo]
(Oh, oh-oh-oh)
[Bridge]
Close your eyes
Picture you and I
Selling daylight
For gasoline
[Chorus]
So now we're gonna chase the moon like fire, yeah
Together we can fake our own deaths here
Just wanna be alone and watch as you all just disappear
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
[Outro]
Just wanna be alone and watch
Why can't we be alone and watch?
