[Verse 1]
Trust me, trust me
I don't like being alone
Thinking bout ringing your line
I wish you would come home
But I'm just tryna balance my space
I'm just tryna protect my space (Oh)
I don't really need the pain
But I love to feel the pain
Maybe I could use a break
So we just might have to wait (Oh)
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause we're way too in love, just to fuck and let go
'Cause we're way too involved, just to cut and not call
[Chorus]
Way too in deep (Deep)
Way too in deep
Way too in deep (Deep)
Way too in deep (Oh)
Wish I could call, wish I could call and go home
(Oh no no no) We can't even let it go
