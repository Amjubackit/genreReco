So move over darling
If my heart bends
I'll know
And if I heard you stayed
You know I would have stayed
So baby don't hold me back
Cause if I win
I'll change
And if I lose my way
You know I would escape
Damaged by the sea
The sun blaze over me
Oh baby tie me down
I'm dangling, Oh
Past the storm
And if you change your heart
Doesn't mean I'm erased
And if I say I know
Would it be a mistake
I was once away
And now I'm just in pace
And if I lose my way
I know I would be safe
Damaged by disease
The sun blaze over me
Oh baby tie me down
I'm dangling! Oh
Past the storm
Oh this is what I'll say
Just imagine I'm late
I will take my chance
And now this must end
No I won't hold you back
You're a star babeâ€š go fly
And if you lose your way
You know I won't be safe
Damaged by the sea
The sun blaze over me
Oh baby tie me down
I'm dangling dangling
Oh you (keep)
Dangling dangling
Oh you (keep it)
Dangling dangling
Oh you (keep me)
Dangling dangling
