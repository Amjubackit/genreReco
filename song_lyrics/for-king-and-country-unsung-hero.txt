[Verse 1: Joel Smallbone]
Once upon a time, you were twenty-five
Walkin' up the aisle, you made the promise of your life
Blinked twice and you were twenty-nine
Singing lullabies, and I looked up at you for the first time
[Pre-Chorus: Joel Smallbone]
Words fall short but I am sure
There'll never be anyone like you, you're
[Chorus: Joel Smallbone]
You're strong like your father even when you are scared
When I was in trouble, you nevеr left me therе
And you love like your mother, like there's nothing to lose
You're an unsung hero, so I'll sing this song for you
[Verse 2: Luke Smallbone]
Woke up, I was twenty-one, and I fell in love
Remember how I told you that I'd
Searched the world and I found the girl
And oh, how she reminds me of you, you're
[Chorus: Luke Smallbone]
Strong like your father even when you are scared
When I was in trouble, you never left me there
And you love like your mother, like there's nothing to lose
You're an unsung hero, so I'll sing this song for you[Bridge: Luke & Joel Smallbone, 
Luke Smallbone
]
For all the times I fell down, you showed me how to stand
And when we crossed the ocean, you were my safe place to land
Been on a thousand stages, but when it's all said and done
I hope I make you proud of, 
of the man that I've become
[Chorus: Joel Smallbone, 
Joel & Luke Smallbone
]
To be strong like my father even when I am scared
And when someone's in trouble, I'll never leave them there
And I'll love like my mother, like there's nothing to lose
You're my unsung hero, and I sing this song for you
