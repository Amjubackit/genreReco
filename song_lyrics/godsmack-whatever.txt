[Verse 1]
And I wonder
Day to day
I don't like you
Anyway
I don't need your Shit today
You're pathetic
In your own way
[Pre-Chorus]
I feel for you...
Better fuckin go away
I will behave...
You better fuckin go away!
[Chorus 1]
I'm doing the best I ever did
I'm doing the best that I can
I'm doing the best I ever did...
[Verse 2]
I don't need to
Fantasize
You are my pet
All the time
I don't mind if
You go blind
You get what you get
Until you're through with mine
I feel for you...
Better fuckin go away
I will behave...
You better go away!
[Pre-Chorus]
I feel for you...
Better fuckin go away
I will behave...
You better fuckin go away!
[Chorus 2]
I'm doing the best I ever did
I'm doing the best that I can
I'm doing the best I ever did
Now go away!
I'm doing the best I ever did
I'm doing the best that I can
I'm doing the best I ever did
Now go away!
[Bridge]

I'm doing the best that I can
I'm doing the best I ever did
