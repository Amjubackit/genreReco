[Intro: Tessa Douwstra]
I just wanna see
I just wanna see the light
I just wanna see
I just wanna see the light
I just wanna see
I just wanna see the light
I just wanna see the light
[Chorus: Tessa Douwstra]
Even if it makes me blind
I just wanna see the light
Breathe in, leave it all behind
I just wanna see the light
[Chorus: Tessa Douwstra]
Even if it makes me blind
I just wanna see the light
Breathe in, leave it all behind
I just wanna see the light
[Pre-Drop: Tessa Douwstra]
I just wanna see the light
I just wanna see the light
I just wanna see the light
I just wanna see the light
Light.. light.. light.. light.. light.. light.. light..
I just wanna see the light
