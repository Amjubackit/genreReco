[Instrumental Intro]
[Verse]
I don't wanna lose my mind again
I remember every word you said
If there was a way I would go back
If there was a way I would go back
[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna lose my mind again
Even if I try I can't forget
If there was a way I would go back
If there was a way I would go back
[Chorus]
You've changed, I've changed
You've changed, it's not the same
You've changed, I've changed
You've changed, it's not the same
[Verse]
I don't wanna lose my mind again
I remember every word you said
If there was a way I would go back
If there was a way I would go back
