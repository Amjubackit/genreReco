[Verse 1]
Sleigh bells ring, are you listening?
In the lane snow is glistening
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland
Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
Who sings a love song as we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland
[Bridge]
In the meadow we'll build a snowman
And we'll pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say "Are you married?," we'll say "No, man
But you can do the job when youâ€™re in town"
[Verse 2]
Later on we'll conspire
As we groove by the fire
To face unafraid plans that we made
Walking in a winter wonderland
[Bridge]
(In the meadow we can build a snowman) Snowman
(We'll pretend that he is Parson Brown)
(He'll say "Are you married?," we'll say "No, man") What? No man
("But you can do the job when you're in town")
