[Verse: Wyatt]
Scum shit, dumb shit
Drum stick, vanilla
Expiration date
I can give you salmonella
Truth is I'm lucky
I made it off a fluke like a junkie
Soil is so murky
Future is a haze, I am foggy
[Pre-Chorus: Wyatt]
I'm a stupid prick talking to myself
On the way home, I don’t need your help
Even if I did, I wouldn’t let you know
Flame lit like a candle, chop it up and go
[Chorus: Mac Demarco]
I can pay you twenty
I called so many times
I can pay you twenty
Don’t know what’s in these bags
I can pay you twenty
I called so many times
I can pay you thirty
Don’t know what’s in these bags[Verse: Wyatt]
Scum shit, dumb shit
Drum stick, vanilla
Expiration date
I can give you salmonella
Truth is I'm lucky
I made it off a fluke like a junkie
Soil is so murky
Future is a haze, I am foggy
[Pre-Chorus: Wyatt]
I'm a stupid prick, talking to myself
On the way home, I don’t need your help
Even if I did, I wouldn’t let you know
Flame lit like a candle, chop it up and go
[Chorus: Mac Demarco]
I can pay you twenty
I called so many times
I can pay you twenty
Don’t know what’s in these bags
I can pay you twenty
I called so many times
I can pay you thirty
Don’t know what’s in these bags[Outro: Wyatt]
Scum shit, dumb shit
Drum stick, vanilla
Expiration date
I can give you salmonella
Truth is I'm lucky
I made it off a fluke like a junkie
I'm a stupid prick, talking to myself
On the way home, I don’t need your help
Even if I did, I wouldn’t let you know
Flame lit like a candle, chop it up and go
