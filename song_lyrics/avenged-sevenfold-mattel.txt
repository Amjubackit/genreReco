[Verse 1]
My vinyl skin provides protection
It holds in place my plastic bones
Cast button eyes reflect an image and all seems as it should
But there's nobody home
Cue the breeze that sway the painted trees
Toy yellow birds upon the rooftops sing in chorus with the buzzing bees
Melt in sun LED beams from the sky being held on a string
While boredom tears me apart at the seams
[Chorus]
Now I know this might sound crazy
But I've smelled the plastic daisies
And it seems we've found ourselves in hell
[Verse 2]
Round head consumed with major nothings
Ears made of wax unfit to hear
Day after day it all plays over, dedicated loop, same year after year
Please attend, 
all model citizens
, R.S.V.P. if we can count you in, empty as we play pretend
Send our thoughts with you and to your kin and 
in case we don't see you again
Good afternoon, good evening, and goodnight
[Chorus]
Now I know this might sound crazy
But I've smelled the plastic daisies
And it seems we've found ourselves in hell[
Bridge
]
Living feign in porcelain and 
just smart enough to know nothing at all
Pull my string and make me cry
Advertisement, moral scrawl, a semblance of choice when there's no choice at all
Out of stock "The end is nigh"
[Breakdown]
Burn
Body burn
Burn
[Chorus]
Now I know this might sound crazy
But I've smelled the plastic daisies
And it seems we've found ourselves in hell
