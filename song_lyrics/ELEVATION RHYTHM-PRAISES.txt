[Intro]
All my friends just wanna be famous
Living life with a lot of time wasted
I choose You, You're what's missing
I choose You, now I'm different
Everyone's saying I'm crazy
Good thing they're not God who made me
So let 'em talk, it don't phase me
I'm gonna give You all my praises
[Verse 1: Jordan Holliday]
It's different now
I see Your love, see it all around
Nothing's gonna keep it down
I gotta praise, gotta let it out
Gonna let it out
[Pre-Chorus: Jordan Holliday]
One thing is true, I was made to love You
[Chorus: Jordan Holliday]
All my friends just wanna be famous
Living life with a lot of time wasted
I choose You, You're what's missing
I choose You, now I'm different
Evеryone's saying I'm crazy
Good thing they're not God who madе me
So let 'em talk, it don't phase me
I'm gonna give You all my praises
