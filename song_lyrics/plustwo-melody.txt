[Chorus]
'Cause I know that I want you so bad
'Cause I know that I want you so bad, bad
'Cause I know that I want you so bad
'Cause I know that I want you so bad, bad
[Refrain 1]
Melody
I hear a kind of harmony
And I don't want to lose it
Now I'm free
And I am happy like the wind
But I know that is not true
[Verse 1]
Hey, man, give me another glass of wine
You know I feel so sad and tired
I want to forget my tears tonight
So please give me another peaceful smile
[Refrain 1]
Melody
I hear a kind of harmony
And I don't want to lose it
Now I'm free
And I am happy like the wind
But I know that is not true[Chorus]
'Cause I know that I want you so bad
'Cause I know that I want you so bad, bad
'Cause I know that I want you so bad
'Cause I know that I want you so bad, bad
[Verse 2]
I wish you were here where I am
With your non-conformist friend
You hurt me with your nonchalance
To let me in another bed
[Refrain 2]
Little mask
Is a masquerade of happiness
And I don't wanna see
I don't know, why I have to love you so
If you were only nice man, man
[Instrumentals]
[Refrain 1]
Melody
I hear a kind of harmony
And I don't want to lose it
Now I'm free
And I am happy like the wind
But I know that is not true[Refrain 2]
Little mask (everybody)
Is a masquerade of happiness (needs somebody)
And I don't wanna see (and I need you)
I don't know, why I have to love you so (everybody)
If you were only nice man, man (needs somebody)

Baby I wanna kiss you
Please come to, come to me
Baby I wanna take you
Please come to, come to me
Baby I wanna hold you
Please come to, come to me
Baby I wanna love you
Please come to, come to me
Baby I wanna kiss you
Please come to, come to me
