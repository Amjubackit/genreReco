[Verse 1: Slim Jxmmi]
I've done it before, I've seen it before
Tears splashin' the floor when I open the door for her
She actin' like a whore and I'ma let her
Learned from Project Pat-ta, pimpin', got a Master's
Girl, improvise, look me in my eyes and lie to me
Lie to me, act like I'll believe anything
Sex on the beach and in the backseat
This could be us (But fuck it)
[Chorus: Swae Lee & 
Jace
]
So back to what I was saying
(Money make the world go 'round)
This could be us, but you're playing
(Money make your girl go down)
This could be us, but you're playing
(Money make the world go 'round)
I'm high, hope I don't sound crazy
(Money make your girl go down)
Fuck what them niggas was saying
(Money make the world go 'round)
This could be us, but you're playing
(Money make your girl go down)
This could be us, but you're playing
(Money make the world go 'round)
But shit, that's all I was saying
(Money make your girl go down and that's just how it go)
