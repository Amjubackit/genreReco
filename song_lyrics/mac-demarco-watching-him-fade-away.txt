[Verse 1]
Haven't got the guts to call him up
Walk around as if you never cared in the first place
But if you never call, you'll end up stuck
Without another chance to tell him off right to his face
[Chorus]
And even though we barely know each other
It still hurts watching him fade away, watching him fade away
Watching him fade away, watching him fade away
[Verse 2]
I know you never meant to put him down
And even if you did, he sure deserved it
The thought of him no longer being around
Well, sure, it would be sad but not really different
[Chorus]
And even though we barely know each other
It still hurts watching him fade away, watching him fade away
Watching him fade away, watching him fade away
