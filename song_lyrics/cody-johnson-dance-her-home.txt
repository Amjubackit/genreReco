[Verse 1]
Here she comes a-walkin' in, cotton dress a-swishin'
The smoke is thick and the lights are dim and she sure got me wishin'
For a little bit of time out on that ol' dance floor
If she gives me half a chance at romance, I'm gonna dance her home
[Verse 2]
Well, hey, bartender, see that girl? Ask her what she's drinkin'
Tell her if she looks this way I'll be the one a-winkin'
'Cause I saw her light up when the DJ played a little George Jones
If she gives me half a chance at romance, I'm gonna dance her home
[Chorus]
'Cause if we got to two-steppin', we could come up missin'
And find a corner booth of our own
Just a-huggin' and a-kissin' like two lovers reminiscin'
Man, this feeling's comin' on strong
If she gives me half a chance at romance, I'm gonna dance her home (Get to dancin', boy)
[Bridge]
What the hell is wrong with me? I feel like I'm sinkin'
How hard can it really be to tell her what I'm thinkin'?
[Chorus]
That if we got to two-steppin', we could come up missin'
And find a corner booth of our own
Just a-huggin' and a-kissin' like two lovers reminiscin'
Man, this feeling's comin' on strong
If she gives me half a chance at romance, I'm gonna dance her home[Outro]
If she gives me half a chance at romance
No, I won't be leaving here alone
'Cause if she gives me half a chance at romance, I'm gonna dance her home
I'm gonna dance her home
