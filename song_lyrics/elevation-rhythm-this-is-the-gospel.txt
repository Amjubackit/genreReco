[Intro]
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
[Verse 1: Joe L Barnes]
In the beginning, You sent the earth spinning
Fashioned us from the dust
And since our existence, there's only been one mission
For You to commune with us
And then came the garden, we became the fallen
Sin made us lose our way
Oh, but the love that's too good to give up
Set a course for amazing grace
[Chorus: Joe L Barnes]
This is the Gospel, this is the Good News
Tell everybody how He saved you
This is the Gospel, come hear the Good News
Tell everybody, there's a God that loves you
[Post-Chorus: Joe L Barnes]
Oh, how He loves you
There's a God that loves you
Oh, how He loves you
There's a God that loves you
[Verse 2: Joe L Barnes]
Then came the Savior, was born in a manger
Raised up to ransom us
Healing the blind, raising dead back to life
All the signs of His perfect love
And there on the cross, how He paid every cost
He defeated death, hell and grave
And on that third morning, the stone started rolling
Oh, what a beautiful day, yeah
[Chorus: Joe L Barnes]
This is the Gospel, this is the Good News
Tell everybody how He saved you
This is the Gospel, come hear the Good News
Tell everybody, there's a God that loves you
[Post-Chorus: Joe L Barnes]
Oh, how He loves you
There's a God that loves you
Oh, how He loves you
There's a God that loves you
Ya ready?
[Bridge: Joe L Barnes]
Hallelujah, here and now
You have turned my life around
Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
I was lost but now I'm found, sing it out!
Hallelujah, here and now (Right here, right now)
You have turned my life around (Nothing but Your amazing grace)
Amazing grace how sweet the sound

Come hear the Good News (It was nothing but Your grace)
Tell everybody, there's a God that loves you (Hallelujah)
[Bridge: Joe L Barnes]
