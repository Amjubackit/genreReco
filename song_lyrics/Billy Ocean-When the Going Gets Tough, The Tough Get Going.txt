When the going gets tough
The tough get going, tough, tough, huh, huh, huh
When the going gets tough, the tough get ready
Yeah, ooooh, do da do da
I got something to tell you
I got something to say
I'm gonna put this dream in motion
Never let nothing stand in my way
When the going gets tough
The tough get going
I'm gonna get myself 'cross the river
That's the price I'm willing to pay
I'm gonna make you 
stand and deliver
And give me love in the old-fashion way
Woooh
Darlin', I'll climb any mountain
Darlin', I'll do anything
Ooh (ooh), can I touch you (can I touch you)
And do the things that lovers do
Ooh (ooh), want to hold you (wanna hold you)
I gotta get it through to you, oooh
