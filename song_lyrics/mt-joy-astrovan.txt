[Verse 1]
Angels smoking cigarettes on rooftops in fishnets in the morning with the
Moon still glowing
And here comes Jesus in an Astrovan rolling down the strip again
He's stoned while Jerry plays
[Chorus]
Life ain't ever what it seems
These dreams are more than paper things
And it's alright mama you're afraid
I'll be poor along the way
I don't wanna see those tears again
You know, Jesus drives an Astrovan
Yes, he does (I say: whoo)
[Verse 2]
And in my heart there's a holy ghost writhing on the floor from an overdose
You know the best ones never come down
So if I love at the tip of my toes reaching out for the great unknown
Every addict has illusions
[Chorus]
Life ain't ever what it seems
These dreams are more than paper things
And it's alright mama you're afraid
I'll be here along the way
I don't wanna see those tears again
You know Jesus drives an Astrovan
Yes, he does (I say: whoo)
[Bridge]
And when I see those angels on the roof
I'll know I've made it when my
Doobie smoking Jesus puts my name upon his guestlist
And says son you're famous in heaven
Maybe you're famous in heaven
And maybe there is no heaven
Maybe we're all alone together now
But I don't wanna see those tears again
You know Jesus drives an Astrovan
[Outro]
I don't wanna see those tears again
You know Jesus drives an Astrovan
