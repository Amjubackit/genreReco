[Verse 1]
There's a spark of magic in your eyes
Candyland appears each time you smile (Ooh ooh ooh)
Never thought that fairy tales came true
But they come true
When I'm near you
[Pre-Chorus]
You're a genie in disguise (Ooh ooh ooh)
Full of wonder and surprise
And
[Chorus]
Betcha by golly, wow
You're the one that I've been waiting for forever
And ever will my love for you
Keep growing strong
Keep growing strong
[Verse 2]
If I could I'd catch a falling star
To shine on you so I'll know where you are (Ooh ooh ooh)
Order rainbows in your favorite shade
To show I love you
Thinking of you
[Pre-Chorus]
Write your name across the sky (Ooh ooh ooh)
Anything you ask I'll try
'Cause
[Chorus]
Betcha by golly, wow
You're the one that I've been waiting for forever
And ever will my love for you
Keep growing strong
Keep growing strong
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus] X2
Betcha by golly, wow
You're the one that I've been waiting for forever
And ever will my love for you
Keep growing strong
Keep growing strong
[Outro]
Betcha by golly, wow
You're the one that I've been waiting for forever
