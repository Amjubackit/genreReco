[Verse 1]
I might be too strung out on compliments
Overdosed on confidence
Started not to give a fuck and stopped fearin' the consequence
Drinkin' every night because we drink to my accomplishments
Faded way too long, I'm floatin' in and out of consciousness
And they sayin' I'm back, I'd agree with that
I just take my time with all this shit, I still believe in that
I had someone tell me I fell off, ooh, I needed that
And they want to see me pick back up, well, where'd I leave it at?
I know I exaggerated things, now I got it like that
Tuck my napkin in my shirt 'cause I'm just mobbin' like that
You know good and well that you don't want a problem like that
You gon' make someone around me catch a body like that
No, don't do it (Ayy), please don't do it (Ayy)
'Cause one of us goes in and we all go through it (Ayy)
And Drizzy got the money, so Drizzy gon' pay it
Those my brothers, I ain't even gotta say it
That's just something they know
[Chorus]
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah, they know, yeah
That the real is on the rise
Fuck them other guys
I even gave 'em a chance to decide
Now it's something they know
They know, they know, they know (Yeah)
