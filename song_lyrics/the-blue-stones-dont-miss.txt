[Verse 1]
At the bar with a drink and I'm maxed out
Not a sound, 3 AM, I'm the last out
They barely know my name, but I've been in here for days
And I'm smooth, so I'll deal with the facts now
[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, I can't figure it out
Ooh, here comes my doubt
[Chorus]
I'm a beast in the night, yeah, I go there
And I'll say what I want, yeah, I don't care
They get mad when I follow it up
Oh, 'cause it's hit, hit, hit
I don't miss, miss, miss, uh-huh
Yeah, it's hit, hit, hit
I don't miss, miss, miss, uh-huh
[Verse 2]
Take a step, do a dance, I'm a black cat
Pretty girls, southern France, where my head's at
I'm a king and the dagger in the dark
Got the pulse of the city in my ice-cold heart
[Chorus]
I'm a beast in the night, yeah, I go there
And I'll say what I want, yeah, I don't care
They get mad when I follow it up
Oh, 'cause it's hit, hit, hit
I don't miss, miss, miss, uh-huh
They get mad when I follow it up
Oh, 'cause it's hit, hit, hit
I don't miss, miss, miss, woo
[Bridge]
I can't figure it out
Here comes my doubt
I can't figure it out
[Chorus]
I don't care if it's dark, turn the lights out
'Cause I move like a shark in the night now
They get mad when I follow it up
Oh, 'cause it's hit, hit, hit
I don't miss, miss, miss, uh-huh
'Cause it's hit, hit, hit
I don't miss, miss, miss, woo
I don't care if it's dark, turn the lights out
'Cause I move like a shark in the night now
They get mad when I follow it up
Oh, 'cause it's hit, hit, hit
I don't miss, miss, miss, uh-huh
