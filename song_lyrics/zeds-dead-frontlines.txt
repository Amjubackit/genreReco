[Verse 1]
Scared of livin' my old ways
(My old ways)
Stuck on this one way train roll
(This one way train roll)
And I can't find the brakes
(And I can't find the brakes)
Taking me where I don't know
(Don't know)
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm alone
So far from home
A stranger looking back
I don't know where to go
[Chorus]
Didn't I see your light on?
Didn't I see your light on?
Didn't I see your light on?
[Drop]
Didn't I see your light on?
Didn't I see your light on?
[Verse 2]
Follow you through the haze
(Follow you through the haze)
Pebbles tap on your window
Feel the cold on my face
(On my face)
I don't wanna hear you say no[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm alone
So far from home
A stranger looking back
I don't know where to go
[Chorus]
Didn't I see your light on?
Didn't I see your light on?
Didn't I see your light on?
[Drop]
Didn't I see your light on?
Didn't I see your light on?
