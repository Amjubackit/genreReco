[Chorus]
What did you do?
Got me confused-used
Spinning, spinning 'round and 'round
Sticky, sticky, off the ground
Slipping 'til you let me drown
Hate me then and love me now
[Verse 1]
You got me wondering where the spunk went
Where the funk went
Not who I'm in love with
You got me wondering while you roaming
Something told me I would end up lonely
[Pre-Chorus]
You know I cannot shake you
You know I cannot break you
You only fool me, then you lose me
Then right back I take you
You know we're bad together
You don't want this forever
Then I look stupid, call me foolish
But I'll do whatever
[Chorus]
What did you do?
Got me confused-used
Spinning, spinning 'round and 'round
Sticky, sticky, off the ground
Slipping 'til you let me drown
Hate me then and love me now
