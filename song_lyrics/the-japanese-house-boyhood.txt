[Verse 1]
I could have been somebody else but
I've been out looking for me
It doesn't matter what I tell myself
For a moment there I swear I saw me
[Verse 2]
I went to meet somebody new
Changed beneath the evening light
And she held me kind of like you do
I hope you know
[Chorus]
I could have been somebody who
You wanted to have around to hold
I should have jumped when you told me to
I wanna change but it's nothing new
And if I grow I'm gonna get so old
Will you hold me like you always do?
[Verse 3]
I used to be somebody else
And, I'm still out looking for me
I go out and try to chase myself
Find someone that might restore me[Verse 4]
I could have been somebody new
And I'm talking to myself again
But I don't know who I'm talking to
I think it's you
[Chorus]
I could have been somebody who
You wanted to have around to hold
I should have jumped when you told me to
I wanna change but it's nothing new
And if I grow I'm gonna get so old
Will you hold me like you always do?
[Instrumental break]
[Chorus]
I could have been somebody who
You wanted to have around to hold
I should have jumped when you told me to
I wanna change but it's nothing new
And if I grow I'm gonna get so old
Will you hold me like you always do?
