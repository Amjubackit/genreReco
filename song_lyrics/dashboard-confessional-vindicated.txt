[Verse 1]
Hope dangles on a string
Like slow-spinning redemption
Winding in, and winding out
The shine of it has caught my eye
And roped me in so mesmerizing
So hypnotizing
I am captivated
I am
[Chorus]
Vindicated, I am selfish, I am wrong
I am right, I swear I'm right
Swear I knew it all along
And I am flawed
But I am cleaning up so well
I am seeing in me now
The things you swore you saw yourself
[Verse 2]
So clear, like the diamond in your ring
Cut to mirror your intention
Oversized, and overwhelmed
The shine of which has caught my eye
