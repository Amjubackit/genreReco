[Verse 1]
Tell me I was never good enough
Remind me of the demons that I've been running from
Tell me who the hell you thought I was
Or just blame it on the person, the person I've become
[Pre-Chorus]
Lately, I don't give a fuck
'Cause I can't be myself when I'm with anyone
Maybe I'm already gone
I'll never be the same
[Chorus]
It hit me like a hurricane
It hit me like a tidal wave
And I don't know why I drown my mind in everything they say
It hit me like a hurricane
It hit me like a tidal wave
And I don't know why I drown my mind, it got the best of me
[Verse 2]
Tell me that I'm lost inside my mind
(I reach out, but it's pulling me under)
Remind me I've been searching for something I won't find
Tell me I was never worth the time
(I reach out, but it's pulling me under)
Or just blame it on the person you think I left behind
