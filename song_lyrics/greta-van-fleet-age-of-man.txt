[Intro]
In an age of darkness light appears
And it wards away the ancient fears
March to the anthem of the heart
To a brand new day, a brand new start
[Verse 1]
To wonderlands of ice and snow
In the desert heat where nothing grows
A tree of life in rain and sun
To reach the sky it's just begun
[Chorus]
And as we came into the clear
To find ourselves where we are here
Who is the wiser to help us steer?
And will we know when the end is near?
[Verse 2]
A beauty lives in every soul
The more you love the more you know
They pass the torch and it still burns
Once children then it's now our turn
[Chorus]
And as we came into the clear
To find ourselves where we are here
Who is the wiser to help us steer?
And will we know when the end is near?
