[Verse 1]
Good for you, you fooled everybody
Good for you, you fooled everyone
Good for you, now you're somebody
Good for you, you fooled everyone
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Leave your weapon on the table
Wrapped in burlap, barely able
Don't get angry, don't discourage
Take a shot of liquid courage
[Chorus]
'
Cause my monsters are real
, and they're trained how to kill
And there's no comin' back and they just laugh at how I feel
And these monsters can fly, and they'll never say die
And there's no goin' back, if I get trapped I'll never heal
Yeah, my monsters are real
[Verse 2]
Good for you, you hurt everybody
Good for you, you hurt everyone
Good for you, you love nobody
Good for you, you owe no one
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Leave your weapon on the table
Wrapped in burlap, barely able
Call a doctor, say a prayer
Choose a god you think is fair
