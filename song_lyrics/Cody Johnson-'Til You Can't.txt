[Verse 1]
You can tell your old man you'll do some large-mouth fishin' another time
You just got too much on your plate to bait and cast a line
You can always put a rain check in his hand
'Til you can't
[Verse 2]
You can keep puttin' off forever with that girl who's heart you hold
Swearin' that you'll ask someday further down the road
You can always put a diamond on her hand
'Til you can't
[Chorus]
If you got a chance take it
Take it while you got a chance
If you got a dream chase it
'Cause a dream won't chase you back
If you're gonna love somebody
Hold 'em as long and as strong and as close as you can
'Til you can't
[Verse 3]
There's a box of greasy parts sittin' in the trunk of that sixty-five
Still waitin' on you and your grandad to bring it back to life
You can always get around to fixin' up that Pontiac
'Til you can't
