[Part I: Self Care]
[Intro: Mac Miller]
Mhm, mhm
Okay
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Dollars
[Chorus: Mac Miller]
I switched the time zone, but what do I know?
Spendin' nights hitchhikin', where will I go?
I could fly home, with my eyes closed
But it'd get kinda hard to see, that's no surprise though
And you could find me, I ain't hidin'
I don't move my feet when I be glidin'
I just slide in and then I roll out
[Verse 1: Mac Miller & 
JID
]
Yep
Well, climbin' over that wall (
Yeah, wall, wall
,) mm
I remember, yes, I remember, yes, I remember it all
Swear the height be too tall (
Yeah
), so like September I fall
(Down, down, down) Down below
Now I know that the medicine be on call, yeah (
Gimme, gimme, gimme
)
When it's feelin' like you hot enough to melt, yeah (Melt, yeah)
Can't trust no one, can't even trust yourself, yeah (-Self, yeah)
And I love you, I don't love nobody else, yeah (Else, yeah)
