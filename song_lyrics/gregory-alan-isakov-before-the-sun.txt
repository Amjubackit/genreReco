[Verse 1]
Fifty-five mile signs
Thunder crack and lightning
While something else inside
Shines like the Fourth of July
[Chorus]
I'll go it on my own
I'll go it on my own
Go it on my own
Sand city bus
Kicking up dust, kicking up dust
Before the sun comes up
[Verse 2]
The Devil sees us now
Clear as the moon glows
Sleeping in our winter clothes
Radio's a crackling fire
[Chorus]
I'll go it on my own
I'll go it on my own
Go it on my own
Sand city bus
Kicking up dust, kicking up dust
Before the sun comes up
