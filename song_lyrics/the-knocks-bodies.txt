[Verse 1]
It's another suburban summer
The street lights blink on
If you're passing the house on the corner
You'd think no one's home
[Pre-Chorus]
But when I feel that resonation
Waving with the weight from
Bodies in the basement
And when you swing my way won't
Wait no way, no way, want
Bodies in the basement
[Chorus]
When I feel that 8-0-8 drum
Waving with the weight from
Bodies in the basement
And when you swing my way won't
Wait no way, no way, want
Bodies in the basement
[Break]
[Post-Chorus]
Your body on my, body on my
My bodies in the basement
Your body on my, body on my
Bodies in the basement
[Verse 2]
I'm still thinking about that summer
Lyin' awake all alone
Keep on passing the house on the corner
But there's nobody home
[Pre-Chorus]
But when I feel that resonation
Waving with the weight from
Bodies in the basement
And when you swing my way won't
Wait no way, no way, want
Bodies in the basement
[Chorus]
When I feel that 8-0-8 drum
Waving with the weight from
Bodies in the basement
And when you swing my way won't
Wait no way, no way, want
Bodies in the basement
[Post-Chorus]
Your body on mine
Body and mind
My body's in the basement
[Break]
[Post-Chorus]
Your body on mine
Body and mind
My body's in the basement
Your body on mine
Body and mind
Bodies in the basement
[Outro]
Oh wait, oh wait, oh wait
No way, no way, no way
No way, no way, no way, no
Oh wait, oh wait, oh wait
No way, no way, no way
My body's in the basement
