[Verse 1]
Wearing raspberry velvet and the rabbits in the hole
Where the apple tree fell over two years ago
Man, you could never stop, it was always gonna go
When you're hiding in the cotton get a tickle in your soul
[Pre-Chorus]
And I could really go for a little bit of rock 'n' roll
Yeah, I could really go for a little bit of rock 'n' roll
[Verse 2]
Let's go looking in the sugar cane
And wander 'round the country in the pouring rain
Win a couple dollars, lose a couple games
And walk tall laughin' in the sugar cane
[Pre-Chorus]
And then take a trip on a golden airplane
Yеah, then take a trip on a golden airplanе
[Chorus]
And you'll tell me what your heart's been through
Tell me where you're going, too
Tell me all things you'd like to do but you can't
'Cause you're scared that you're going to Hell
Feels alright but you can't really tell
All of that cigarette ash is good and well
It's good and well
