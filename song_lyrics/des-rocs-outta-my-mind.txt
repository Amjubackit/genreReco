[Verse 1]
This is hell, this is everything I love
But it's harder than it’s ever been before
Let it flow like a melody of blood
Look alive, kid, you're turning skin and bones
Oh, I'm just pleased to know I’m perfect for the role
[Pre-Chorus]
Now lookit, I've arrived
Now lookit, I've arrived
[Chorus]
Am I out of my mind?
Am I out of my mind?
Am I out of my mind?
Am I out of my mind?
Am I out of my mind, mind, mind?
Am I out of my mind, mind, mind?
Am I out of my mind?
Am I out of my mind?
[Verse 2]
Feel the faith go and drain out from the tub
Swirling down until there's nothin' but a gulp
Grab a wire and rip it on out the bomb
Oh, baby, this damage is done
Hey, groundswell command
Are you ready for the band?[Pre-Chorus]
Now lookit, I've arrived
Now lookit, I've arrived
[Chorus]
Am I out of my mind? (Out of my mind)
Am I out of my mind?
Am I out of my mind? (Out of my mind)
Am I out of my mind?
Am I out of my mind, mind, mind?
Am I out of my mind, mind, mind?
Am I out of my mind? (Out of my mind)
Am I out of my mind?
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Am I out of my mind? (Yeah)
Am I out of my mind? (Out of my mind)
Am I out of my mind? (Yeah)
Am I out of my mind? (Out of my mind)
Am I out of my mind, mind, mind?
Am I out of my mind, mind, mind?
Am I out of my mind? (Out of my mind)
Am I out of my mind?
