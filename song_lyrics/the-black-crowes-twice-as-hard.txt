[Intro]
Do you know what I'm singing?
[Verse 1]
Oh, yeah
Clean as a whistle
Smellin' like a rose
She got her dirty little finger
Bloodshot eyes are gone
You wanna tell me that I'm wrong
[Chorus]
Twice as hard
As it was the first time
I said goodbye
Twice as hard (One time, baby, two time)
First time, I said goodbye
[Post-Chorus]
Nobody ever wanna know
Love ain't funny
It's a crime in the wink of an eye
[Verse 2]
Oh, yeah
Your sister always singing
She plays the step child
A broken little memory
I was never kind
Are you the one to tell me I'm blind?
[Chorus]
Twice as hard
As it was the first time
I said goodbye
Twice as hard (Two time)
As it was the first time
I said goodbye
[Post-Chorus]
Nobody ever wanna know
Love ain't funny
It's a crime in the wink of an eye
[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, bloodshot eyes are gone
And you think you're the one to tell me I'm wrong
[Chorus]
Twice as hard
As it was the first time
I said goodbye
Twice as hard
As it was the first time
I said goodbye
(Twice, baby) Twice as hard
As it was the first time
I said goodbye
Twice as hard
As it was the first time
Bye
[Outro]
