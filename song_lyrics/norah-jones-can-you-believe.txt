[Intro]
Ah, oh
Can you believe?
Can you believe?
Can you believe?
[Verse 1]
Do you hear me speaking?
Your name is rolling off my tongue
Can you hear the whispering?
The shame is not what I'll become
[Chorus]
Ooh
Can you believe?
Can you believe?
Can you believe?
[Verse 2]
Sometimes when I'm cryin'
A diamond falls into my heart
When my eyes are dryin'
You come rip 'em all apart
[Chorus]
Ooh
Can you believе?
Can you believe?
Can you bеlieve?
[Verse 3]
Tell me you can hear me
Tell me I'm not alone
In this whole world
Can there be someone
Who I can call
Call my own?
[Bridge]
Come and take me higher
Than I can ever climb alone
Set my world on fire
And met this frozen piece of snow
[Chorus]
Ooh
Can you believe?
Can you believe?
Can you believe?
Can you believe?
Can you believe?
Can you believe?
Can you believe?
Can you believe?
[Outro]
Oh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Oh-oh, oh
Ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh
Yeah
Oh, whoa, oh-oh
Ah, oh-oh-oh
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
