[Verse 1]
Since I let you go
I don't need no help
Mirror crystal clear, I
Finally know myself
So I make my way home, I'm in it alone, but I
I got everything I need
So turn up the AC and let myself breathe 'cause I
I can't settle for maybes, baby
[Chorus]
Love is not enough, girl
Ooh
I just need more
Some more
Love is not enough, girl
Hoo
I just need more
More
More
[Verse 2]
I make my way home, I'm in it alone, but I
I got everything I need
So turn up the AC and let myself breathe 'cause I
I can't settle for maybes baby
[Chorus]
Love is not enough, girl
Ooh
I just need more
Some more
Love is not enough, girl
Hoo
I just need more
More
More
[Hook 1]
Can't
Last forever
Impossible romance
Can't
Last forever
You
Never stood a chance
[Hook 2]
And you made me believe
That I'd heal in time
But the time that we spent
Had me out of my mind
Now I finally see
How you treated me
Wasn't s'posed to be
But
[Hook 3]
Always looking for something new
Tell me all the things you do
'Cause I just need more
Some more
Always looking for something new
Tell me all the things you do
'Cause I just need more
More
More
[Chorus]
Love is not enough, girl
Ooh
I just need more
Some more
Love is not enough, girl
Hoo
I just need more
More
More
[Hook 1]
Can't
Last forever
Impossible romance
Can't
Last forever
You
Never stood a chance
[Outro]
Careful what you're wishing for
I've been so far blind
Gimme mine, I'll give you yours
Yours
