This is the day, this is the day
That the Lord has made, that the Lord has made
I will rejoice,I will rejoice
And be glad in it, glad in it
This is the day that the Lord has made
I will rejoice and be glad in it
This is the day, this is the day
That the Lord has made
This is the day, this is the day
That the Lord has made, that the Lord has made
I will rejoice, I will rejoice
And be glad in it, glad in it
This is the day
That the Lord has made
I will rejoice and be glad in it
This is the day
This is the day that the Lord has made
This is the day
That the Lord has made
I will rejoice and be glad in it
This is the day
This is the day that the Lord has made
That the Lord has made
That the Lord has made
That the lord has made
As I look back over all the years that I made it through
Can't imagine (ooh ooh) where i'd be now (ooh ooh) if it wasn't for you (wasn't for you)
Why your favor rests upon me I could never explain Your favor is just what I needed
Why your favor rests upon me I could never explain Your favor is just what I needed
Why your favor rests upon me I could never explain Your favor is just what I needed
But I'm so glad that I can say
I will rejoice
