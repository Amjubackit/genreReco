[Intro]
She likes the way I put it down
She likes the way I put it down
Yeah (She likes the way—)
[Verse 1]
Uh, tab for the bad lil' bitches in the city and it's all on me
Time, low time when the love so blind that you're all I can see
Know the night won't be the same if you don't leave with me
Ass up, head down, every time you dress down
Know I like
[Chorus]
I like, I like, I like it
I like, I like, I like it
I like, I like, I like it
I like, I like, I like it (She likes the way—)
[Verse 2]
Good ass girl in the bad ass city
Got the itty bitty titty but the ass come with it
Got you hopin' that a flash come with it
Lookin' single in the club but you hopin' that a man don't get it
And she pullin' up, late night, no tees, play fight
Big jaw, grey white, fuck 'til the daylight
Put it to sleep 'cause I don't need no Xan'
And she fuckin' with me then she gon' need both hands, yeah
Big penthouse, spend another ten thou'
Nothin' get rent out, money get sent out
Good brain, good head, get the sense out
Then I make it rain in the bed, pullin' ten thou'
She likes the way I put shit down
And I likes the way, I ain't gotta call her whenever I'm in town
And she know when to pull up
Pull up on the block, throw the hood up
The block, ten boy, woodgrain with the foot up
Call me when you need somebody to work on that body the way that he should've, yeah
I pull up AM, scotch colored grey Benz, whole room darker than Ray-Bans
And I'm still on that ass like spray tan
I would get it poppin' with you or your eight friends but look
[Chorus]
I like, I like, I like it
I like, I like, I like it
I like, I like, I like it
I like, I like, I like it
[Outro]
She likes the way I put it down
She likes the way I put it down
Yeah (She likes the way—)
