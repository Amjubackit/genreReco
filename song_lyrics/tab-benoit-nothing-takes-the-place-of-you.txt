I 
moved your picture from my wall
And I replaced them baby, both large and small
And 
each new day oh finds me so blue
Because nothing, nothing takes the place of you
I 
read your letter, oh baby one by one
And I still love ya, ya know I do, when it's all said and done
And oh my darlin, oh I'm so blue
Because nothing, no nothing takes the place of you
And as, as I write this letter
Lord it's raining, raining on my windowpane
And as, as I feel baby in need of you
Cause without you, without you nothing seems the same
And so I'll wait, baby till your home
Oh and I'll love again, yes I will but right now I'm so all alone
And oh my darlin baby I'm so blue, because nothing, nothing take the place
Of you
Because nothing, no nothing takes the place of you
