[Chorus]
Oh, don't you dare look back
Just keep your eyes on me
I said, "You're holding back"
She said, "Shut up and dance with me"
This woman is my destiny
She said, ooh-ooh, shut up and dance with me
[Verse 1]
We were victims of the night
The chemical, physical kryptonite
Helpless to the bass and the fading light
Oh, we were bound to get together
Bound to get together
[Pre-Chorus]
She took my arm
I don't know how it happened
We took the floor and she said
[Chorus]
"Oh, don't you dare look back
Just keep your eyes on me"
I said, "You're holding back"
She said, "Shut up and dance with me"
This woman is my destiny
She said, ooh-ooh, shut up and dance with me
