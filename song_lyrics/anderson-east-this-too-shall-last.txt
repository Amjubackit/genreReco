[Verse 1]
Looking all around, you think nothing is really working
The pieces never fit quite naturally
It didn't come with directions, but somehow we found perfection
And it all worked out just how it was meant to be
[Pre Chorus]
Through the passion, through the fights
The wrong turns we made right
The one thing, one thing never changed
[Chorus]
And this too shall last
When the beauty is gone and time goes by too fast
The feelings, the lonely troubles don't seem to pass
We got each other, it will be alright
We got the love to make it through the night
This too shall last
[Verse 2]
Now the door is always open, never mentioned and never spoken
And only we know where we like to hide the keys
And no wind could have weathered, it's holding us together
As long as we live in our home, yeah I believe
[Chorus]
And this too shall last
When the beauty is gone and time goes by too fast
The feelings, the lonely troubles don't seem to pass
We got each other, it will be alright
We got the love to make it through the night
This too shall last
This too shall last
[Pre Chorus]
Oh, through the passion, through the fights
The wrong turns we made right
This one thing, one thing will never change
[Chorus]
And this too shall last
When the beauty is gone and time goes by too fast
The feelings, the lonely troubles don't seem to pass
We got each other, it will be alright
We got the love to make it through the night
This too shall last
[Outro]
Got each other, it'll be alright
This too shall last
Got each other, it'll be alright
This too shall last
