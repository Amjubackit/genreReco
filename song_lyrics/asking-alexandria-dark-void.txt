[Intro]
One more chance to fall asleep
Inside this nightmare that's taking every part of me
One more chance to fall asleep
Inside this nightmare that's taking every part of me
[Verse 1]
If you scratch under the surface, try to find a purpose
I wonder what the dead would find
Trapped inside the prison of my mind, and I'm
Sick of messing up, up, but forget it now
Every time I try to stop, stop, I fall apart
Lost deep down, I'm searching for a glimpse of hope
I'm sick of messing up, up but forget it now
[Chorus]
Believe in me, and set me free
I'll drag thesе memories through the dark void
Just lеt me be, my saviour, please
Help me crawl out the darkness
[Verse 2]
If you're digging through the dirt to see what you can find inside
Trapped inside the prison of my mind, and I
Try to live in the moment, lost my mind, now I'm broken
Can't escape the darkness that's been dragging me down
Lost deep down, I'm searching for a glimpse of hope
[Chorus]
Believe in me, and set me free
I'll drag these memories through the dark void
Just let me be, my saviour, please
Give me hope for the hopeless through the dark void
[Bridge]
One more chance to fall asleep
Inside this nightmare that's taking every part of me
One more chance to fall asleep
Inside this nightmare that's taking every part of me
One more chance, one more chance
[Breakdown]
One more chance to fall asleep
Inside this nightmare that's taking every part of me
One more chance to fall asleep
Inside this nightmare that's taking every part of me
One more chance to fall asleep
Inside this nightmare that's taking every part of me
[Chorus]
Believe in me, and set me free
I'll drag these memories through the dark void
One more chance to fall asleep
(Just let me be, my saviour, please)
Inside this nightmare that's taking every part of me
One more chance to fall asleep
Inside this nightmare that's taking every part of me
(Give me hope for the hopeless)
[Outro]
Believe in me, and set me free
I'll drag these memories through the dark void
