[Verse 1 - Ras Luv]
Natty Dread like Bob so rock steady
With no spaghetti with meat sauce
Maybe salads with one toss
No bread of the sorrow cause afraid to see tommorow
It's religion never suspicious
You're too delicious for the tongue
See the lungs breathe a natural high
Just like the shirts that's so lovely
So ask Marco Polo and I never go solo
Cause I roll with the crew that keep the funk flows
That make ya dance until the sisters take glance
I hope you find romance....try your luck take a chance
Til I enter like the Milton Plaza I'm the center
Of it all, the fuckin' prince of the ball
Standing six feet tall, that's a long way to fall
But not worry, cause my vision ain't blurried
The +I+ is hotter than the spice and curry
So don't stress the father or you might feel the fury
[Verse 2 - Grap Luva]
So check the situation, a raw deal is what we facin'
What's the flavour of the rules they mandate
The climbin' gets hotter as the city gets smarter ( ? )
A million one catch they tryin' to earn top dollar
Half that mill, they straight out to kill
I'm cultivated and destined to act real ill
Black let up in the things of five burroughs of pain
Only reason why the east and the west it ain't the same
I'm twenty-something years of age and life surely ain't about hand-outs
So I lace my plan out, hard work is levicated to an encore survival
Considergize less and from conception to arrival
Now that I'm here my fear shall decrease
Learn about life makin' my way to the east
From four square yard struggler
The G's on time, yo god hit me with that rhyme
