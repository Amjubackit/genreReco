[Verse 1]
In this hole, that is me
The dead are rolling over
In this hole thickening
Dirt shoveled over shoulders
[Pre-Chorus 1]
I feel it in me, so overwhelmed
Oh, this pressured center rising
My life overturned, unfair the despair
All these scars keep ripping open
[Chorus]
Peel me from the skin
Tear me from the rind
Does it make you happy now?
Tear meat from the bone
Tear me from myself
Are you feeling happy now?
[Verse 2]
In this hole, that is me
A life that's growing feeble
In this hole, so limiting
The sun has set, all darkens
