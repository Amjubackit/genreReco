[Verse 1]
Mmm
There will be mountains
That I will have to climb
And there will be battles
That I will have to fight
But victory or defeat, it's up to me to decide
But how can I expect to win if I never try
[Chorus: Both]
I just can't give up now
I come too far from where I started from
Nobody told me the road would be easy
And I don't believe He's brought me this far
To leave me
[Verse 2]
Never said there wouldn't be trials
Never said I wouldn't fall
Never said that everything would go
The way I wanted to go (no no no no)
But when my back is against the wall
And I feel all hope is gone
I'll just lift my head up to the sky
And say help me to be strong
