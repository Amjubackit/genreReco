[Verse 1]
Have faith in me
'Cause there are things that I've seen I don't believe
So, cling to what you know and never let go
You should know things aren't always what they seem
[Chorus]
I said I'd never let you go, and I never did
I said I'd never let you fall, and I always meant it
If you didn't have this chance, then I never did
You'll always find me right there, again
[Verse 2]
I'm going crazy
'Cause there are things in the streets I don't believe
So, we'll pretend it's alright (Pretend it's alright)
And stay in for the night
Oh, what a world, I'll keep you safe here with me (With me)
[Chorus]
I said I'd never let you go, and I never did
I said I'd never let you fall, and I always meant it
If you didn't have this chance, then I never did
You'll always find me right there, again
I said I'd never let you go, and I never did
I said I'd never let you fall, and I always meant it
If you didn't have this chance, then I never did
You'll always find me right there, again
