[Verse 1]
Down here on planet zero
They swing that gavel hard
No words, no peace, no advocate
No signs of life so far
[Verse 2]
Better pray for the soul of the citizen
Better pray that you're not erased
On your knees for the life you're livin'
On your knees or you'll be replaced
Replaced
[Chorus]
Out here on planet zero
We live like no tomorrow
I think we've reached the ceiling
They'rе canceling your feelings
On to better days or so thеy say
But I don't think so
They're murdering our heroes
Out here on planet zero
[Verse 3]
Look at me, I'm not lookin' for a favor
I'm just lookin' for an axe to grind
All hail, power to the people
Except you, you check the box we don't like
Don't like
So bite your tongue 'cause it might save your life[Chorus]
Out here on planet zero
We live like no tomorrow
I think we've reached the ceiling
They're canceling your feelings
On to better days or so they say
But I don't think so
They're murdering our heroes
Out here on planet zero
[Bridge]
Ten, nine
Eight, seven
Six, five
Four, three, two, one
Shut the door, say a prayer, kill the lights
Bite your tongue 'cause it might save your life
Shut the door, say a prayer, hold your breath
No one's comin', you're the only one left
[Chorus]
Down here on planet zero
There might be no tomorrow
I think we've reached the ceiling
They're canceling your feelings
On to better days or so they say
But I don't think so
They murdered all your heroes
Down here on planet zero
Zero[Outro]
(Zero) Shut the door, say a prayer, kill the lights
Bite your tongue 'cause it might save your life
(Zero) Shut the door, say a prayer, hold your breath
No one's comin', you're the only one left
