[Instrumental]
[Verse 1]
Children with their toys of war
Birthright of death with a fiery breath
Funeral of innocence
Painted up in the red and dressed in lead
We are
[Chorus]
Are we prisoners or renegades?
Well, I've done my time, woah
Behold visions of burning skies
Alas, Babylon
Woah, woah, woah, woah
[Verse 2]
Mothers of barbarians, woah
Were your young so spry when they left to die?
We are
[Chorus]
Are we prisoners or renegades?
Well, I've done my time, woah
Behold visions of burning skies
Alas, Babylon
Woah, woah, woah, woah
[Instrumental]
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah
[Chorus]
Are we prisoners or renegades?
Well, I've done my time, woah
Behold visions of burning skies
Alas, Babylon
Woah, woah, woah, woah
