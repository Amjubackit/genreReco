Give me a sign that we can start over again
Let's go for a ride, could this be where it begins?
And all this time, you held it inside somewhere
So throw me a line, we can weather the storm 'till the end
And I run, 'till I meet the sun
And I run, until I reach the seas
At the edge of the ocean
There's a place to start over again
At the edge of the ocean
Holds a place, we can start over again
Follow the light, we can count on the starts to shine
Travel billions of miles, we can light up the skies tonight
All my life, you weren't so hard to find
When the morning arrives, you'll be standing there by my side
And I run, 'till I meet the sun
And I run, until I reach the seas
At the edge of the ocean
There's a place to start over again
At the edge of the ocean
Holds a place, we can start over again
Moving on, I was leaving
Will you remember me?
Can't turn back those feelings
What will be, it will be
I found a place to live along the ocean's edge
Can't hold back those feelings
It's just the way we are
It's just the way we areAnd I run, 'till I meet the sun
And I run, 'till I reach the seas
Won't you go, you know I'll be there
Don't you know you can always count on me?
I'll be there
Promise me, you'll come my way, yeah
Don't you know you can always count on me?
I'll be there
