[Verse 1]
Run fast from my day job
Runnin' fast from the way it was
Jump quick to a paycheck
Runnin' back to the strip club
I'm never goin' back, never goin' back
No, you can't make me
Never goin' back, never goin' back (Nah)
They'll never take me
I've paid enough of petty dues
I've heard enough of shitty news
I've had a thing for dirty shoes since I was ten
Love dirty men alike
[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh
Better day than yesterday (Keep cuttin' up)
Ooh
I just take it day by day
Ooh, oh
Never hearing what they say (Uh)
Ooh-ooh (Mm)
I just do it my way
[Chorus]
All I got is these broken clocks
I ain't got no time
Just burnin' daylight
Still love, and it's still love, and it's still love
It's still love, still love (Still love), still love
It's still love, it's still love
Nothin' but love for you (Nothin' but)
Nothin' but love (Nothin' but)
Nothin' but love
