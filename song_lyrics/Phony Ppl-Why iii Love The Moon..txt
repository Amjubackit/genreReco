[Intro: Elbee Thrie]
Real love's so hard to find
Just when you think you've found it
The illusions in your eyes
[Verse 1: Elbee Thrie]
That's why I love the moon
Every night it's there for you
It's constant
Unlike these human beings
Who lie about what it seems to be
You think the Earth is where you stand
You're in the palm of someone's hand
And that's why I love the moon
'Cause it's always there for me
Every night up out my window
And that's why I love the moon
'Cause it's always there for me
Every single night I look outside
It's right there for me
And my mind
And that's why I love the moon, yeah
Because people can consume my love
In the wrong way
So I send it up
At night, at night, at night
