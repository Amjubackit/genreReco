I can't agree to disagree
Fighting like I'm fighting for life
They're only words but they cut like a blade
Swinging wide with all of my might
Ah yeah, I guess it's all of that coffee, that's got my mind in a whirl
I'm still cussing and bitching and there ain't nobody here
Oh yeah, you don't have to holler I hear you
I'm standing right here beside you
Oh, 99 shades of crazy, I'm 99 shades of crazy
Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy
Pour another drink, make it a double for me
Maybe I can drink this away
It's never fun when they pull out the gun
Beat you black and blue, boy
You gotta pay, you gotta pay
Oh, where the hell am I? I hope at least I had fun
I'm stumbling through New Orleans oh, to the rising sun
Oh yeah, you don't have to holler I hear you
I'm standing right here beside you
Oh, 99 shades of crazy, I'm 99 shades of crazy
Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazyLord have mercy on me
Noventa nueva tonos de loco
I need some peace, just some relief
From this voice, killing me
You stare at me, and you glare at me
All this pain it's all the same, it's all insane
(you see)
Is this really happening or did I make it all up?
I'm bound for Chattahoochee on a turnip truck
Oh yeah, you don't have to holler I hear you
I'm standing right here beside you
Oh, 99 shades of crazy, I'm 99 shades of crazy
Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy
Ah you're crazy you're crazy
Hold my feet, feet to the fire
You hold my feet to the fire
I never said I was down with you
