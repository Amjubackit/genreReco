[Intro]
Oh, baby, here comes the sound
[Verse 1]
Took a train outta New Orleans
And they shot me full of ephedrine
This is how we like to do it in the murder scene
Can we settle up the score?
[Chorus]
If you were here, I'd never have a fear
So go on, live your life
But I miss you more than I did yesterday
[Post-Chorus]
(You're beautiful)
[Verse 2]
Well, I'm a total wreck, and almost every day
Like the firing squad or the mess you made
Well, don't I look pretty walking down the street
In the best damn dress I own?
[Chorus]
If you were here, I'd never have a fear
So go on, live your life
But I miss you more than I did yesterday
You're so far away
So c'mon, show me how
'Cause I mean this more than words could ever say
[Bridge]
Some might say we are made from the sharpest things you say
We are young and we don't care (Woah-oh)
Your dreams and your hopeless hair (Woah-oh)
We never wanted it to be this way for all our lives
Do you care at all?
[Chorus]
If you were here, I'd never have a fear
So go on, live your life
But I miss you more than I did yesterday
You're so far away
So c'mon, show me how
'Cause I mean this more than words could ever say
[Outro]
What'd you call me?
Well, there's no way I'm kissing that guy
Well, come on, come on, come on, come on
Yeah
