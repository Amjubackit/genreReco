[Verse 1]
I'd never danced
'Til I danced with you my love
Couldn't hear the music
But I'm sure it was good stuff
I'd never sang
With a tear falling from my eye
And every time I lose it
Oh, and I'm not afraid to cry
[Verse 2]
I'd never spoke
To one like you before
Told you all my secrets
And you wanted more
I'd never looked
Into eyes as clear as yours
And every time I lose it
Nothing matters more
[Chorus]
Oh, don't look now
If the superstition's got you down
Thеre's no right way
To get back to her hеart, oh Lord
Don't you worry 'bout how
But I got it all figured out
They can take my name and take my fame
Lavender girl, take me back to the start
