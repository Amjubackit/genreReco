[Verse 1]
When the best of me is barely breathin'
When I'm not somebody I believe in
Hold on to me
When I miss the light the night has stolen
When I'm slammin' all the doors You've opened
Hold on to me (Hey)
Hold on to me
[Chorus]
Hold on to me when it's too dark to see You
When I am sure I have reached the end
Hold on to me when I forget I need You
When I let go, hold me again
[Verse 2]
When I don't feel like I'm worth defending
When I'm tired of all my pretending
Hold on to me
When I start to break in desperation
Underneath the weight of expectation
Hold on to me
Hold on to me
[Chorus]
Hold on to me when it's too dark to see You (
I'll hold on
)
When I am sure I have reached the end
Hold on to me when I forget I need You (
I'll hold on
)
When I let go, hold me again[Verse 3]
I could rest here in Your arms forever
'Cause I know nobody loves me better
Hold on to me
Hold on to me
