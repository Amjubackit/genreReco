[Intro: Gloria Barnes]
Home, home
Home, home
[Verse 1: Caribou]
She just does what she pleases
'Cause she's happy on her own
And she picks up all the pieces
[Chorus: Caribou & 
Gloria Barnes
]
She's going home
Baby, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home
Yeah, she's going home
Baby, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home
[Post-Chorus: Gloria Barnes]
Home, home
Home, home
Home, home
Baby, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home
Baby, I'm home
[Verse 2: Caribou & 
Gloria Barnes
]
It all seemed so easy
Home, home
'Til she did it on her own
Home, home
There's so much she can teach me[Chorus: Caribou & 
Gloria Barnes
]
She's going home
Baby, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home
Yeah, she's going home
Baby, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home
[Bridge: Caribou & 
Gloria Barnes
]
She's better off than she has ever been
Home, home
Now she's made her peace with everything
Home, home
[Chorus: Caribou & 
Gloria Barnes
]
Yeah, she's going home
Baby, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home
Yeah, she's going home
Baby, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home
Yeah, she's going home
Baby, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home
She's going home
Baby, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home
