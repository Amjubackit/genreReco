[Verse 1]
I don't know anything, I don't know anything
I don't know anything, I don't know who I am
I don't know anything, I don't know anything
I don't know anything, I don't know who I am
[Chorus]
Why we have to live in so much hate everyday? Oh yeah
Why the fightin' and the comin' down, am I sane? I don't know
Yeah
[Verse 2]
I don't know anything, I don't know anything
I don't know anything, I don't know who to be
I don't know anything, I don't know anything
I don't know anything, I don't know who I am
[Chorus]
Why we have to live in so much hate everyday? Oh yeah
Why the fightin' and the comin' down, am I sane? I don't know
When the teacher put the ruler down on my hand, I laughed
Cross my heart and hide reliever in trails of blood, I love
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
I don't know anything, I don't know anything
I don't know anything, I don't know who I am
I don't know anything, I don't know anything
I don't know anything, I don't know who to be
[Chorus]
Why we have to live in so much hate everyday? Oh yeah
Why the fightin' and the comin' down, am I sane? I don't know
When the teacher put the ruler down on my hand, I laughed
Cross my heart and hide reliever in trails of blood, I love
