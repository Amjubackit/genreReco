[Verse 1]
They told you that you couldn't do it 'cause you're washed up
Ain't like them bad girls, said you should get your sauce up
But I got this plan and you might not understand
I'm gon' go hard as I can
And I'm gon' be the boss of it
Just watch me do this, put no limits, only swag on it
Walk right up to the front where I belong then brag on it
Go to the top, I'ma give it all I got
Might take a lot but we ain't gon' ever stop
[Pre-Chorus]
Now, I do believe I'm something special
Can't take that from me
So you can say what you want
I go harder, stronger
Be who I'm supposed to be
[Chorus]
'Cause I'm unstoppable, I get all the way in it
That's the way I was made and I'm up on my bidness
'Cause I'm unstoppable, ain't no hoping and wishing
Say a prayer, catch a wave then I go out and get it
'Cause I can be what I want, try it if I want
Powered by the King and He won't let me fall
'Cause I'm unstoppable
Nah, nah, He won't let me fall
'Cause I'm unstoppable
[Verse 2]
I dream about it, I go get it, that's how I do it
Not in the stars, I'm not lucky, I just pray through it
Fall on my face and I might make mistakes
But I don't let it break me
'Cause I'm still on my way
[Pre-Chorus]
I do believe I'm something special
Can't take that from me
So you can say what you want
I go harder, stronger
Be who I'm supposed to be
[Chorus]
'Cause I'm unstoppable, I get all the way in it
That's the way I was made and I'm up on my bidness
'Cause I'm unstoppable, ain't no hoping and wishing
Say a prayer, catch a wave then I go out and get it
'Cause I can be what I want, try it if I want
Powered by the King and He won't let me fall
'Cause I'm unstoppable
Nah, nah, He won't let me fall
'Cause I'm unstoppable
[Bridge]
Come what may, I rest in his safety
Winds may blow, waves won't over take me
Tears in my eyes but I'm still gon' survive
'Cause He's incredible, He's powerful
And I will rise from the bottom 'cause He said so
[Chorus]
'Cause I'm unstoppable, I get all the way in it
That's the way I was made and I'm up on my bidness
'Cause I'm unstoppable, ain't no hoping and wishing
Say a prayer, catch a wave then I go out and get it
'Cause I can be what I want, try it if I want
Powered by the King and He won't let me fall
'Cause I'm unstoppable
Nah, nah, He won't let me fall
'Cause I'm unstoppable
