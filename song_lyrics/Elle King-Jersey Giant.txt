[Verse 1]
I remember all them summers
Playing 'til my fingers bled
You'd sing the songs and I'd sing with ya
We'd get drunk and go to bed
Looking back at all them memories
Lord, I hate to sleep alone
But if you ever get the notion
That you need me, let me know
[Chorus]
'Cause it's just two hours to get there, babe
I can make it back about an hour or so
Hold you 
close
 against my skin
I need a little warmth on a night so cold
Singing the songs 
you
 used to sing
The one about the lady in the long, black veil
Should've seen warnings signs
But I loved to hear you wail
High and lonesomе, hard and strong
Even if it was a little out of tune
Hottеr than socks on a Jersey Giant
Lord, I thought you hung the moon
[Post-Chorus]
Lord, I thought you hung the moon
