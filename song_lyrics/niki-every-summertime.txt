[Verse 1]
Eighteen, we were undergrads
Stayed out late, never made it to class, uh
Outer Richmond in a taxi cab
You were sweatin' bullets on the way to my Dad's
And oh, you said, "Baby, think we're movin' too fast!"
[Pre-Chorus 1]
And I swear the magnolias flashed a smile (Flashed a smile)
And that's when I caught me hopin' you'd stay a while (Stay a while)
[Chorus]
Baby, I'd give up anything to travel inside your mind
Baby, I fall in love again come every summertime
My daddy taught me to choose 'em wisely but you don't have to try
'Cause, baby, I fall in lovе every summertimе
[Verse 2]
Twenty-five, man we're missin' church
Laugh 'bout everyone we're hatin' at work
Dinner with your sister and the jokes kinda hurt
Cry the way home and you're puttin' me first, oh
Yeah, you just always know what to say
[Pre-Chorus 2]
We're strolling down the boulevard, and dancing under streetlights (Oh, the lights)
Every year we get older and I'm still on your side (Oh, I)[Chorus]
Baby, I'd give up anything to travel inside your mind
Baby, I fall in love again come every summertime
My daddy taught me to choose 'em wisely but you don't have to try
'Cause, baby, I fall in love every summertime
[Outro]
Every day is summertime
Every day is summertime
Every day is summertime with you
Every day is summertime
Every day is summertime
Every day is summertime with you
