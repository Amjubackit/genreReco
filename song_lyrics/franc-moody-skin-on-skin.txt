[Verse 1]
You're the only one I need tonight
You can set the mood like firelight
I'm done with tryin' to play it cool
I'm down with tryin' to keep it simple
[Pre-Chorus]
All we need's a little skin on skin, toe to toe
We can make it up as we go along
A little skin on skin, toe to toe
We can make it up as we go along
[Chorus]
'Cause we got chemistry
Chemistry
We got chemistry (Chemistry, chemistry)
Chemistry
[Verse 2]
You can't win a heart with cliches
You can't win her over with champagne
She won't fall for no diamond rings
'Cause money won't buy you everything
[Pre-Chorus]
All we need's a little skin on skin, toe to toe
We can make it up as we go along
A little skin on skin, toe to toe
We can make it up as we go along[Chorus]
'Cause we got chemistry
Chemistry
We got chemistry (Chemistry, chemistry)
Chemistry
[Interlude]
[Outro]
It's just chemistry
Chemistry
It's just chemistry
Chemistry
It's just chemistry
Chemistry
(Skin on skin, toe to toe
We can make it up as we go along)
It's just chemistry
Chemistry
(Skin on skin, toe to toe
We can make it up as we go along)
It's just chemistry
Chemistry
