Are you ready?
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
Let's go!
[Verse 1]
Everybody in the world are you with me?
It's too late to try to run, we run the city
It's my time, it's show time
Held me down, now it's don't give a fuck time
It's go time, it's show time
Sing it with me everybody let's go
[Chorus]
'Cause it's one, it's one, one for the money
Two, it's two, 'cause two is for the show
Three, it's three, three get ready
Are you ready motherfuckers? Are you ready? Let's go!
'Cause it's one, it's one, one for the money
Two, it's two, 'cause two is for the show
Three, it's three, three get ready
Are you ready motherfuckers? Are you ready? Let's go!
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
Let's go!
