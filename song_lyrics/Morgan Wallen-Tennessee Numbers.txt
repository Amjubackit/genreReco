[Verse 1]
Used to be our picture from her sister's wedding day
There on her lock screen, now it’s just some ocean waves
Used to be a bunch of hearts right there beside my name
She used to never miss one, but these days that girl just lets it ring
Aw, but if she don't one day
[Chorus]
I'd say, "Damn, it’s good to hear your voice, feels like it's been forever"
Ask her how's her mom and them and how's that West Coast weather?
Yeah, I know, it's late, I'm sorry
But, no, I swear I ain't that drunk
I know she won't and I don’t blame her
But if she ever picked it up
I’d tell her it's my fault and I still love her
But she quit taking calls from Tennessee numbers
[Verse 2]
I bet she hides her accent so one asks her where she’s from
And steers clear of whiskey 'cause it stirs them memories up
And there's a boy from back home that she still won't talk about
If he could talk to her right now
[Chorus]
He’d say, "Damn, it's good to hear your voice, feels like it's been forever"
Ask her how's her mom and them and how's that West Coast weather?
Yeah, I know, it's late, I'm sorry
But, no, I swear I ain't that drunk
I know she won't and I don't blame her
But if she ever picked it up
I'd tell her it's my fault and I still love her
But she quit takin' calls from Tennessee numbers
From Tennessee numbers
