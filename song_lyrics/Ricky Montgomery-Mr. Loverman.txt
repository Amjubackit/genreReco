[Verse 1]
I'm headed straight for the floor
The alcohol's served its tour
And it's headed straight for my skin
Leaving me daft and dim
I've got this shake in my legs
Shaking the thoughts from my head
But who put these waves in the door?
I crack and out I pour
[Chorus]
I'm Mr. Loverman
And I miss my lover, man
I'm Mr. Loverman
Oh, and I miss my lover
[Verse 2]
The ways in which you talk to me
Have me wishin' I were gone
The ways that you say my name
Have me runnin' on and on
Oh, I'm crampin' up, I'm crampin' up
But you're crackin' up, you're crackin' up
[Chorus]
I'm Mr. Loverman
And I miss my loverman
I'm Mr. Loverman
Oh, and I miss my lover
