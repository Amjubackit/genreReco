[Verse 1]
I cried, I've tried
I’ve been the baddest mama's
Broken heart as I can be
This small talk, slow down
One road in and out
Walls are closing in on me
[Hook]
This town ain't big enough for breaking up
I’m 'bout to leave it in a cloud of dust
You're everywhere and I can't take it
Shelby wild horses off to the races
[Chorus]
Until I hit the city limits
'Til I hit the state line
'Til I reach a coast or a ghost town
A thousand miles out
Keep this needle hitting 90
'Til your memory can't find me
Anyhow, keep the pedal down
’Til I see some taillights
That don’t make me think of you
'Til I’m pulled over on thе shoulder
By some flashing blue lights
'Til this harpеr hits the brake
I don't care if it takes me all night
I'm gonna drive you out of my mind[Verse 2]
I did our best new dress
Leaning on the whiskey but it just won’t do it
It's something 'bout this driver side dry my eyes
Got me thinking maybe I should just keep moving
[Chorus]
Until I hit the city limits
'Til I hit the state line
'Til I reach a coast or a ghost town a thousand miles out
Keep this needle hitting 90 'til your memory can't find me
Anyhow, keep the pedal down
'Til I see some taillights that don't make me think of you
'Til I'm pulled over on the shoulder by some flashing blue lights
'Til this harper hits the brake I don't care if it takes me all night
I'm gonna drive you out of my mind
I'm gonna drive you out of my mind
[Hook]
This town ain't big enough for breaking up
I'm 'bout to leave it in a cloud of dust
You're everywhere and I can't take it
Shelby wild horses off to the races
[Chorus]
Until I hit the city limits
'til I hit the state line
'til I reach a coast or a ghost town a thousand miles out
Keep this needle hitting 90 'til your memory can't find me
Anyhow, keep the pedal down
'til I see some taillights that don't make me think of you
'til I'm pulled over on the shoulder by some flashing blue lights
'til this harper hits the brake I don't care if it takes me all night
I'm gonna drive you out of my mind[Outro]
I'm gonna drive you out of my mind
Drive you
I'm gonna drive you out of my mind
