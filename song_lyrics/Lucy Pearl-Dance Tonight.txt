[Chorus: Raphael Saadiq & Dawn Robinson]
I wanna dance tonight (Dance tonight)
I wanna toast tonight (Toast tonight)
I'll spend my money tonight (Spend your money)
I'll spend my money tonight (Spend your money, yeah)
I wanna dance tonight (Dance tonight)
I wanna toast tonight (Toast tonight)
I'll spend my money tonight (Spend your money)
I wanna get freaky tonight (Freakin', baby, yeah)
[Verse 1: Raphael Saadiq]
First thing we need to do
Is buy brand new fits for you
Make sure that you look good
Make sure that I smell good
Let's purchase two new Bentleys
I know that it looks trendy
So glad that it's not windy
Here comes that girl named Jhani
Ask if she wants to go
Tonight's gonna be hot for sure
Be dancin' on the floor
Folks trippin' I don't know
Money flyin' everywhere
Champagne, we won't go there
Bottles poppin' in the air
They'll be screamin, "I don't care"
