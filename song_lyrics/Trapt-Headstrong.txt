[Verse 1]
Circling your, circling your, circling your head
Contemplating everything you ever said
Now I see the truth, I got a doubt
A different motive in your eyes
And now I'm out, see you later
[Pre-Chorus]
I see your fantasy
You want to make it a reality paved in gold
See inside, inside of our heads, yeah
Well, now that's over
I see your motives inside
Decisions to hide
[Chorus 1]
Back off, I'll take you on
Headstrong to take on anyone
I know that you are wrong
Headstrong, we're headstrong
Back off, I'll take you on
Headstrong to take on anyone
I know that you are wrong
And this is not where you belong
I can't give everything away
I won't give everything away
