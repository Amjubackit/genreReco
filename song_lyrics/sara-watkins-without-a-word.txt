[Verse 1]
Trying to back off, trying to lay low
Giving you time to read the stars
Trying to wait for
Something you don't know
To show you where you are
[Chorus]
Where you are
Where you are
Where you are
[Verse 2]
It's been so long now
I know I should forget you
But I ought to let it lie
But I'm bound to wonder all about you
No matter how I try
[Chorus]
There you are
There you are
There you are
[Bridge]
First a knock and then a crash
And a staggering conviction
That I might not catch up
Like all the colors running down a portrait
And now it looks nothing the one I fell in love with
[Verse 3]
I thought I could write you, write down on a story
When all the clear lines blurred
I still want you to show up
Hope you'll just roll through
After all these years without a word
[Chorus]
Without a word
Without a word
Without a word
