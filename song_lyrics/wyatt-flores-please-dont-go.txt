[Verse 1]
Broken glass from a picture frame scattered on the floor
You're screamin' at me, you can't take it anymore
I try and hold you, you just push me away
This ain't nothin' new 'cause we just did this yesterday
[Chorus]
Times are gettin' hard
Hits you like a bullet through your heart
Been tearin' me apart
And it's killin' you, I know
Said, "Won't you stay with me?
I can't keep goin' if you leave"
Ain't how it's supposed to be
So please don't go
[Verse 2]
When the fire's in your eyes, I miss their ocean blue
I miss the blonde-hairеd girl that I thought I once knew
It's hard to reason with thе voices in your head
And it's been three damn days since you've gotten outta bed
[Chorus]
Times are gettin' hard
Hits you like a bullet through your heart
Been tearin' me apart
And it's killin' you, I know
Said, "Won't you stay with me?
I can't keep goin' if you leave"
Ain't how it's supposed to be
So please don't go
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
Times are gettin' hard
Hits you like a bullet through your heart
Been tearin' me apart
And it's killin' you, I know
Said, "Won't you stay with me?
I can't keep goin' if you leave"
Ain't how it's supposed to be
So please don't go
Said, "Won't you stay with me?
I can't keep goin' if you leave"
Ain't how it's supposed to be
So please don't go
[Outro]
Said, "Please don't go"
Said, "Please don't go"
Please don't go
