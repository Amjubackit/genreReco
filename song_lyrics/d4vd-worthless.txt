[Verse 1]
I just left the party with a girl that said she doesn't want me
I feel out of body the way the world keeps wishing death upon me
Take it away, feel it now (Ooh)
Red all in the face, don't calm me down
[Chorus]
'Cause every time the sun comes up I start feeling worthless
It's easier said than done, I'm trying to find my purpose
I should've ran away by now
But I can't escape this town
[Verse 2]
It's taking a minute for me to adjust, wait
It's taking a minute for me to give up, hey
It's been easier to forget and shut up, woah
All that's left in my pocket's a couple of bucks, hey
All I had is gone (All I had is gone)
So what am I waiting on? (What am I waiting on?)
Somebody put me to sleep, I'm done, done, done
[Chorus]
'Cause every time the sun comes up I start feeling worthless
It's easier said than done, I'm trying to find my purpose
I should've ran away by now
But I can't escape this town
