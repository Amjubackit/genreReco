[Verse 1]
I see the colours change when I look at the sky
They tell me, "Life is too short to listen to the lies"
Riding a plastic waterfall, I tell myself I
Won't feel a thing when the summer dies
[Verse 2]
Hey there, can you follow me?
Love is all you need
Nothing really matters if you never believe
Hey there, can you feel me now?
Baby, close your eyes if you like this feeling
Let the black smoke rise
[Chorus]
Black smoke, black smoke, rise
Black smoke, black smoke, rise
Black smoke, black smoke, rise
Black smoke, black smoke, rise (Rise, rise, rise)
[Bridge]
So hang the DJ, play pretend
Burn the city, fuck your friends
And sing along, sing along
Hang the DJ, play pretend
Burn the city, fuck your friends
And sing along, sing along
So hang the DJ, play pretend
Burn the city, fuck your friends
And sing along, sing along
Hang the DJ, play pretend
Burn the city, fuck your friends
And sing along, sing along
Sing along, sing along, sing along, sing along
Sing along, sing along, sing along, sing along
Black smoke
[Drop]
Black smoke
Black smoke
[Verse 3]
Nobody got nothing on the creator's curse
Stuck on a thousand ideas and only one that works
Whatever, soon we'll be dead or worse
Singing our songs in a blacked out hearse
Ooh, these neo friends
Got me feeling alright, take me higher tonight
Ooh, these violent ends
Baby, close my eyes, let the black smoke rise
[Chorus]
Black smoke, black smoke, rise
Black smoke, black smoke, rise
Black smoke, black smoke, rise
Black smoke, black smoke, rise
(Rise, rise, rise, rise, rise, rise)
