[Verse 1]
Well, two years ago, when I was just twenty years old
Well, let me tell you what happened to me
I had a girl who I truly loved
Yeah, we were happy as we could be
We had a house, a picket fence
We had a tire hangin' from a tree
Everything was just as good as gold
Until I caught the bitch cheatin' on me
[Chorus]
So give me back my cocaine, give me back my whiskey
Forget about the time when you almost missed me
Give me back my T-shirt, give me back my jeans
Give you back your hand when you give me back my ring
So give me back my ring
[Verse 2]
Well, that's what happened to me, I guess it happens all the time
Every time I think about that dude in my bed, I start to cry
But I gotta keep my chin up, keep my head held toward the sky
'Cause the same way she had another man, I had another girl on the side
[Chorus]
So give me back my cocaine, give me back my whiskey
Forget about the time when you almost missed me
Give me back my T-shirt, give me back my jeans
Give you back your hand when you give me back my ring
So give me back my ring[Bridge]
Bring it back, bring it back to me, baby
Bring it back, bring it back to me, baby
Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back to me, oh
Bring it back, bring it back to me, baby
Bring it back, bring it back to me, baby
Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back to me, oh
[Chorus]
So give me back my cocaine, give me back my whiskey
Forget about the time when you almost missed me
Give me back my T-shirt, give me back my jeans
Give you back your hand when you give me back my ring
So give me back my cocaine, give me back my whiskey
Forget about the time when you almost missed me
Give me back my T-shirt, give me back my jeans
Give you back your hand when you give me back my ring
So give me back my ring
Hell nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah, oh, oh
