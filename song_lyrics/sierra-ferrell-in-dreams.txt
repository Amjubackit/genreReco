[Verse 1]
I hope I'm in your dreams
The way you are in all of my mine
Mmm, you've got a love so fine
I wish that I could make you mine
Won't you sit down
You know I love you, honey, and you look so tired
I know it's hard, how we're thrown into this life
Then one day we must die
[Chorus]
But that river will flow on
Even after we're all long gone
Now the river will flow on
Take me with you now before I'm one
[Verse 2]
I walk into the room and there you sit
There you sit, you're so alone and quiet
I can't help but stare, how I love you
And it just ain't fair
[Bridge]

But that river will flow on
Even after we're all long gone
Now the river will flow on
Take me with you now before I'm one
