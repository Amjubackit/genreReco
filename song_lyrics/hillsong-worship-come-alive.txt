[Chorus]
Come alive come alive come alive dry bones
Come alive come alive come alive dry bones
Awake arise
Inhale the light
Come alive come alive
[Verse 1]
I’m gonna sing to you dry bones
Until you’re covered in life
And the valley blooms
Like a rosebud in the light
[Verse 2]
Hear the call to attention
Feel the change in the air
For the ground is dry
But the clouds are overhead
[Pre-Chorus 1]
I’m gonna sing it again
[Chorus]
Come alive come alive come alive dry bones
Come alive come alive come alive dry bones
Awake arise
Inhale the light
Come alive come alive
[Verse 3]
Are you waiting on heaven
Or is it waiting on you
For the Holy Ghost is already in the room
[Verse 4]
So you better get ready
‘Cause who knows what He’ll do
Where the four winds blow there’s a
Breakthrough breaking through
[Pre-Chorus 2]
I’m gonna prophesy again
[Chorus]
Come alive come alive come alive dry bones
Come alive come alive come alive dry bones
Awake arise
Inhale the light
Come alive come alive
[Post-Chorus 1]
Come alive alive
Get up and rise rise
[Bridge]
So leave those shackles in the grave now
And dance like you were young
You do not have to live in chains now
There’s a key within your song
So leave the past where it belongs child
And take a leap into the Light
Find the freedom you were born for
And tell that soul to rise
Arise arise arise
[Pre-Chorus 3]
Get up and rise rise
I’ll sing it again
[Chorus]
Come alive come alive come alive dry bones
Come alive come alive come alive dry bones
Awake arise
Inhale the light
Come alive come alive
[Post-Chorus 2]
Come alive come alive
Come alive come alive
Come alive
Up from the ashes
A new life is born
Up from the ashes
Flesh on the bone
