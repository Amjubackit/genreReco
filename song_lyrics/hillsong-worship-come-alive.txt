[Chorus]
Come alive come alive come alive dry bones
Come alive come alive come alive dry bones
Awake arise
Inhale the light
Come alive come alive
[Verse 1]
I’m gonna sing to you dry bones
Until you’re covered in life
And the valley blooms
Like a rosebud in the light
[Verse 2]
Hear the call to attention
Feel the change in the air
For the ground is dry
But the clouds are overhead
[Pre-Chorus 1]
I’m gonna sing it again
[Chorus]
Come alive come alive come alive dry bones
Come alive come alive come alive dry bones
Awake arise
Inhale the light
Come alive come alive
