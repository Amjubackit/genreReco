[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
[Verse 1]
Oh, I don't know, I don't know, oh, where to begin
We are North Americans
And for those of you who still think we're from England
We're not, no
Weâ€™ve been on planes and on trains 'til we think we might die
Far from North America
Where the buildings are old and you might have lots of mimes
Uh-huh, oh, oh
I hate the feelin' when you're lookin' at me that way
'Cause we're North Americans
But if we act all shy, it'll make it okay
Makes it go away
Oh, I don't know, I don't know, oh, where to begin
When we're North American
But in the end, make the same mistakes all over again
Come on, North Americans
[Chorus]
(Ah-ah) Oh, oh, oh, oh
We are North American scum
(Ah-ah) Oh, oh, oh
We're from North America
