[Verse 1]
I find space for what I treasure
And I make time for what I want
I choose my priorities and
Jesus, You're my number one
[Chorus]
So I will make room for You
I will prepare for two
So You don't feel that You
Can't live here
Please live in me
[Verse 1]
I find space for what I treasure
And I make time for what I want
I choose my priorities and
Jesus, You're my number one
Yes Jesus, You're my number one
[Chorus]
So I will make room for You
I will prepare for two
So You, You don't feel that You
Can't live here
Please live in me
