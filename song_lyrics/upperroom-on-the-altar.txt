[Verse 1]
Here's my life as a sacrifice
I'll be the incense
The sweetest fragrance
Only Yours, consecrated for
Only You, Lord
Just for You, Lord
[Refrain]
'Cause I'm Your temple
A dwelling place for You
And Lord, make my heart
A pleasing home for You
[Chorus]
And oh-oh-oh, I will live on the altar
Oh-oh-oh, You are worth what You asked for
If You're searching for a heart as Your reward
Then I am Yours
[Verse 2]
Mm-mm-mm, in Your house
And in Your house, I will daily live
Fixed on one thing, to see Your beauty
'Cause You alone are worth more than gold
I'll trade the world for
A day in Your courts[Refrain]
'Cause I'm Your temple
A dwelling place for You
And Lord, make my heart
A pleasing home for You
[Chorus]
And oh-oh-oh, I will live on the altar
Oh-oh-oh, You are worth what You asked for
Oh-oh-oh, I will live on the altar
Oh-oh-oh, You are worth what You asked for
If You're searching for a heart as Your reward
If You're searching for a heart as Your reward
Then I am Yours
[Interlude]
Oh, everything I have
Everything I am
All I am poured out before You, Jesus
You're worthy
Oh, You're so worthy
We wanna give everything to You
Everything to You
[Bridge]
I wanna be the oil, I wanna be the sacrifice
I wanna be a laid-down lover all my life
Oh, I wanna be the oil, I wanna be the sacrifice
I wanna be a laid-down lover all my life (Sing it again)
I wanna be the oil, I wanna be the sacrifice
I wanna be a laid-down lover all my life
Oh, I wanna be the oil, I wanna be the sacrifice
I wanna be a laid down lover all my life[Chorus]
And oh-oh-oh, I will live on the altar
Oh-oh-oh, You are worth what You asked for
Oh-oh-oh, I will live on the altar
Oh-oh-oh, You are worth what You asked for
If You're searching for a heart as Your reward, Jesus
If You're searching for a heart as Your reward (If You)
If You're searching for a heart as Your reward
Then I am Yours
[Spontaneous]
Oh, I'm Yours
Holy, completely set apart
Oh, I wanna be holy and completely set apart for You
Lord, I wanna be holy and completely set apart for You
Completely set apart for You
Set my heart apart for You
Set my heart apart for Your glory
Set our hearts apart for Your name
For Your name
Just the name of Jesus
Set apart for Your name
Set apart for Your glory
Set apart for Your glory
Set apart for Your name, Lord
Make us Your bride today
Make me Your bride today
Oh, we wanna be holy, set apart for You[Outro]
Sing, "I wanna be the oil"
I wanna be the oil, I wanna be the sacrifice
I wanna be a laid-down lover all my life
I wanna be the oil, I wanna be the sacrifice
I wanna be a laid-down lover all my life
I wanna be the oil, I wanna be the sacrifice
I wanna be a laid-down lover all my life
