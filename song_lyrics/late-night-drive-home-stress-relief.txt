[Verse 1]
I never thought you'd end up with me for long, baby
Running in quicksand to keep you here with me
I had you in my head, baby, every day
Towards the end, I just couldn't hear your name
It's stress relief from everything
[Pre-Chorus]
It's stress relief from everything
[Chorus]
Tell me, tell me you love me
Come back, come back to haunt me
Won't you, won't you let me be myself?
[Verse 2]
I was holding on, but you didn't see my shots, baby
All the times that I couldn't speak my thoughts, well, maybe
Well, this is what I wanted, please don't feel so bad
In love with a ghost, please don't (won't you) come back
Well this is what I wanted, please don't feel so bad
In love with a ghost, please don't come back
[Pre-Chorus]
It's stress relief from everything
[Chorus]
Tell me, tell me you love me
Come back, come back to haunt me
Won't you, won't you let me be myself?
[Interlude]
(Well, it was difficult, you know, doing all this)
(It got easier over time, but) (where did you get your [?])
[Verse 3]
Si puedes venir conmigo, amor
Yo te enseño todo lo que hay
¿Por qué me tratas asi?
Como no soy nadien
[Bridge]
Tell me you love me
Come back to haunt me
Won't you just let me be myself?
[Chorus]
Tell me, tell me, tell me you love me (tell me you love me)
Come back, come back, come back to haunt me (come back to haunt me)
Won't you, won't you, won't let me be myself? (Won't you let me be?)
