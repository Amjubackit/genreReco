[Chorus]
Well, I've been in love with love, and the
Idea of something binding us together
You know that love is strong enough
And I've seen time tell tales about that
Systematic drug, yeah, that heart that beats as one
It's collectively, unconsciously composed
[Interlude]
Do do do do, do do do do
Do do do do, do do do do
Do do do do, do do do
Do, do do do do
Do do do do, do do do do
Do do do do, do do do do
Do do do do, do do do
Do, do do do do
[Verse 1]
Well, I lost my head in San Francisco
Waiting for the fog to roll out
But I found it in a rain cloud
It was smiling down
[Pre-Chorus]
Do you feel the love? I feel the love
C'mon, c'mon, let's start it up
Let it pour out of your soul[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
Well, I've been in love with love, and the
Idea of something binding us together
You know that love is strong enough
And I've seen time tell tales about that
Systematic drug, yeah, that heart that beats as one
It's collectively, unconsciously composed
[Post-Chorus]
Do you feel the love? I feel the love
C'mon, c'mon, let's start it up
Let it pour out of your soul
Do you feel the love? I feel the love
C'mon, c'mon, let's start it up
Let it pour out of your soul
[Outro]
Do do do do, do do do do
Do do do do, do do do do
Do do do do, do do do
Do, do do do do
