[Verse 1]
Better back down, you're in my domain
Got the whole crowd screaming out our name
It's a blowout, it's a hurricane
It's over before you know it
Why you shaking? We're a dynasty
In the making, we're the royalty
Now we're breaking down the enemy
Move over for the soldiers
[Pre-Chorus]
Take a swing, I can take a hit
If we die, it's fine, we live for this
It's all for this
[Chorus]
We're gonna stand on top with our hands in the sky
Gonna raise our cup to the stadium lights
For the glory, for the glory
For the glory, for the glory
We celebrate with the city tonight
Hear the hometown cheer, it's the ultimate high
For the glory, for the glory
We do it for the glory, for the glory
[Verse 2]
Yeah, we've waited for our time to come
Calculated everything we've done
We've upgraded, now you can't outrun
A champion, now you're facing one
Can you hear them? Yeah, it's all for us
You believe them? Yeah, it's serious
Hear the siren? We're victorious
I'm telling ya, can I get a hell yeah?
