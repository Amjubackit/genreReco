[Intro: Perry Farrell]
The entertaining lights
When the sky and stars at night
Fashioned by divine design
Divine
Divine designer
Under lights in the sky
[Chorus: Ernest Fowler and the Voices of Conquest & 
Perry Farrell
]
No, we don't understand
Why they treat us so mean
No, we don't understand it at all
But we'll do our best
To pass the test
And we'll never turn back no more (
The big, big, beautiful lights
)
No, we don't understand
Why they treat us so mean
No, we don't understand it at all
But we'll do our best
To pass the test
And we'll never turn back no more (
Under lights in the sky
)
[Verse: Perry Farrell]
The music of light
The music of light
That's our song, love is our song (oh)
It's what we've known all along
Love is our song
Big, big, beautiful light
Love is so powerful
Love is so strong
Love is our right
But we've known all along
