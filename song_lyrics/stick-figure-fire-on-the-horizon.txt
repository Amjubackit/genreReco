[Verse 1]
There’s a little old town and it’s tucked away
On an island on the sea
So far away from everything
Where time it don’t mean a thing
And time moves slow and certainly
We got no place to be
Where’s there’s love there is life
There's a hope and a dream
This is the place for you and me
[Refrain]
We can go, we can stay
We can hide, we can run away
We can feel and swim in the ocean
We’ve fallen, life keeps calling
[Verse 2]
I found love in the strangest places
Where all is meant to be
Jamming to the sounds of your favorite song
I said good love is all we need
And when you get down
Turn it up loud, and soon we’ll feel at peace
When the world does you wrong
You listen to that song, like the birds — they listen to the trees[Chorus]
There’s a fire on the horizon
There’s a fire, so let it burn
We can get higher over the mountain
We’ve fallen, life keeps calling
[Bridge](x2)
In this jungle, we are all just animals
We’re criminals, but we’re innocent always
[Verse 3]
So many miles I’ve walked
So many rivers I’ve crossed
So many battles I’ve lost
Make me who I am today
And when tomorrow it comes
There’ll be a brand new sun
This song is not over
It’s just begun
[Chorus]
