And I don't and I don't and I don't and I don't...
Bring it back
And I don't and I don't and I don't and I don't...
I don't and I don't and I don't and I don't
And I don't care how high you are
Open your mind, inhale the dark
Yeah
Bring it back
And I don't and I don't and I don't and I don't...
I don't and I don't and I don't and I don't
Two hands they take me by surprise
I'm gripping on to where I think I should arrive
We lie so vacant in the dark
Take me now so I can wake up, and drift away
Bring it back
And I don't and I don't and I don't and I don't...
I don't and I don't and I don't and I don't
Two hands they take me by surprise
I'm gripping on to where I think I should arrive
We lie so vacant in the dark
Take me now so I can wake up, and drift away
Cause I don't care how high you are
Open your mind, inhale the dark
And I don't care how high you are
Don't wake me up til we arrive
And I don't care how high you are
Open your mind, inhale the dark
And I don't care if it's the last time, time, time ...
Yeah
And I don't and I don't and I don't and I don't...
Bring it back
And I don't and I don't and I don't and I don't...
I don't and I don't and I don't and I don't
And I don't care how high you are
Open your mind, inhale the dark
[?]
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
