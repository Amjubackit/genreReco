[Intro]
I just spent two hours, I just spent two hours cryin'
I just spent two hours
Wait, two hours?
Yeah
I just spent two hours (Two hours)
[Verse]
I just spent two hours cryin' but how could you know that
When all you see is me smilin' like I work for Kodak?
Little things hurt like a giant
Lil Wayne, I feel like dyin'
But you know I can't stop tryin', I hope you know that
This shit been so fuckin' crazy, I might bring my 'fro back
Just 'cause you posted a picture it don't make you pro black (Ooh)
Can't you see that I'm just tired? Roll one up, now I'm just flyin'
When I see over horizons, don't make me go back
[Chorus]
It's gettin' hard to hold back
 (Hold back, ooh)
It's gettin' hard to hold back
It's gettin' hard to hold back these tears
It's gettin' hard to hold back (Hold back, ooh)
It's gettin' hard to hold back
It's gettin' hard to hold back these tears[Outro]
Two hours, two hours
