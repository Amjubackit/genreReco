May not come when you want Him,
but He's on time (on time).
In times of trouble, I find Him to be
a friend of mine (of mine).
When storm clouds rise in your life,
He'll be there (be there)
All your burdens,
I know the Lord will bear (bear)
Weeping may endure for a night,
keep the faith it will be alright.
Weeping may endure for a night,
keep the faith it will be alright, right.
Troubles don't last always.
No, no, no, no, it won't last always.
