[Refrain]
Why can't you want me like the other boys do?
They stare at me while I stare at you
Why can't you want me like the other boys do?
They stare at me while I stare at you
Why can't you want me like the other boys do?
They stare at me while I stare at you
It's true, I crave you
It's true, I crave you
[Drop]
[Interlude]
I walked into the room dripping in gold
Dripping, dripping
I walked into the room dripping in gold
Dripping, dripping
It's true, I crave you
Let's just stop and think, before I lose faith
[Drop]
[Interlude]
I walked into the room dripping in gold
I walked into the room dripping in gold
A wave of heads did turn, or so I've been told
Or so I've been told
My heart broke when I saw you kept your gaze controlled
Oh, I cannot solve
[Outro]
Why can't you want me like the other boys do?
They stare at me while I crave you
