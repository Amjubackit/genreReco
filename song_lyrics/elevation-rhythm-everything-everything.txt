[Verse 1]
When the stress of the world
Is too much to take
There's a place I can run to
Every piece of my pride
Now I give away
You’re the hope that I cling to
[Pre-Chorus]
There's nothing like falling
Right into the arms of the father
Here in your presence
I'm caught in a love like no other
[Chorus]
This feels like heaven
Nothing is missing
I know I will be safe here in your sight
Everything, everything’s all right
My heart is open
There is no distance
I know fear has no place in your light
Everything, everything's alright
[Verse 2]
Won't let go this is love
That will never fade
You're the song that I'm singing
Holding on to the words
That I heard you say
You're the truth that I'm living
