Oh, ohh oh, ohh oh, ohh ohh ohh
Oh, ohh oh, ohh oh, ohh ohh ohh
Tell me now, what's wrong with me?
I'm caught up in your mystery
You've got no money, but you're walking around like royalty
Illusion, my my
In the morning early light
Oh oh, I let go
Falling for your fools gold
Oh oh, I let go
Falling for your fools gold
Oh, ohh oh, ohh oh, ohh ohh ohh
Oh, ohh oh, ohh oh, ohh ohh ohh
You tell me, "New York City's never been too clean
San Francisco's a dirty machine,"
But they don't want you, honey bee
Tell me now, what's wrong with me?
Illusion, my my
I think I see it in your eyes
Oh oh, I let go
Falling for your fools gold
Oh oh, I let go
Falling for your fools gold
You know I see right through you
I see right through you
Oh oh, I let go
Falling for your fools gold
Oh oh, I let go
Falling for your fools gold
Fools gold
Oh, ohh oh, ohh oh, ohh ohh ohh
Oh, ohh oh, ohh oh, ohh ohh ohh
