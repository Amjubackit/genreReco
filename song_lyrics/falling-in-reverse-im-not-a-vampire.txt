[Verse 1]
Well, I'm not a vampire, but I feel like one
Sometimes I sleep all day because I hate the sunlight
My hands are always shaking, body's always aching, and the dark is when I feed
Well, I can lure any woman that I want to in my bed with me
[Pre-Chorus]
And whiskey seems to be my holy water
Mothers, better lock your doors and hide your daughters
[Chorus]
I'm insane, well, I can feel it in my bones
Coursing through my veins, when did I become so cold?
For goodness sake's, where is my self-control?
If home is where my heart is, then my heart has lost all hope
[Verse 2]
Well, I'm not a zombie, but I feel like one today
Self-induced comatose, chemical daze
My head is always spinning from this dizzy blurry vision and my stomach has had enough
I feel like a lady that is pregnant with a baby 'cause I'm always throwing up
[Pre-Chorus]
Hi, my name is Ronnie, I'm an addict
Daddy should've never raised me on Black Sabbath
