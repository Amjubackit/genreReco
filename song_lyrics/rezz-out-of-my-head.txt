[Verse 1]
Shadows, they follow me
They know my name
I saw your face again and again
Am I pretend
[Chorus]
When I close my eyes for the last time
I will sing to you from the night sky
Tired of demons living in my mind
Get out of my head
Get out of my head
Get out of my head
[Drop]
Of my head
Get out of my head
Head, head
Head, head
Get out of my head
[Verse 2]
Shadows, they're calling me
We're not the same
They got a hold on me
It's driving me insane[Chorus]
Whеn I close my eyes for thе last time
I will sing to you from the night sky
Tired of demons living in my mind
Get out of my head
Get out of my head
Get out of my head
[Drop]
Of my head
Get out of my head
(Head, head
Head, head)
Get out of my head
[Outro]
Of my head
Get out of my head
(Head, head
Head, head)
Get out of my head
