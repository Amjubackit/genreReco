[Verse 1]
I had the greatest day of my life
The boys were shootin' doubles under western starlight
I rode a boat across the bay
Phoenix to Seattle to San Francisco
Hearin' Debbie laugh under downtown-bar glow
Louie tellin' me he feels free from yesterday
Drank a cup of coffee couple hours south
Of the place I used to run around
When I was too young to really know
The difference in love and longin' for it
When to shut up and when to stay with it
How to forgive and just let go
[Chorus]
'Cause this is thе greatest day of my life
If I movе or close my eyes
It'll be gone and so will I
So come on in and stay awhile
Years are just moments in a great big pile
She's there laughin' on the porch swing of my mind
And I'm just grateful to be here at closin' time
[Verse 2]
I had the greatest day of my life
Wrote up a single in a New York high-rise
How the city makes a country boy dream
Played pool in Colorado after snow all night
It rained in Carolina but we played just fine
Charles is always better than last week
What did I do to deserve all this?
A roof over my head and a band that don't miss
Healthy dog that hugs me when I'm home
Nowadays I don't feel so alone
It can't get better but what have I ever known?[Chorus]
'Cause this is the greatest day of my life
If I move or close my eyes
It'll be gone and so will I
So come on in and stay awhile
Years are just moments in a great big pile
She's there laughin' on the porch swing of my mind
Nowadays I ain't so lonely all the time
And I'm just grateful to be here at closin' time
[Outro]
I had the greatest day of my life
The boys were shootin' doubles under western starlight
I rode a boat across the bay
