[Verse 1]
When it feels like the dark
Lingers longer than the night
When the shadows feel like giants
Are You chasing me down?
[Verse 2]
Tell me where could I run
From Your light, where could I hide
Hemmed within Your precious thoughts
There's no hiding from Your love
[Chorus 1]
Highs and lows
Lord, You're with me either way it goes
Should I rise or should I fall
Even so
Lord, Your mercy is an even flow
Youâ€™re too good to let me go
[Verse 3]
Should I dance on the heights
Or make my bed among the depths
Your mercy waits at every end
Like You planned it from the start[Verse 4]
Should the dawn come with wings
Or find me far-side of the sea
There Your hand still fastens me
Ever closer to Your heart, ooh
[Chorus 2]
Highs and lows
Lord, You're with me either way it goes
Should I rise or should I fall
Even so
Lord, Your mercy is an even flow
Should I rise or should I fall
You are faithful through it all
You're too good to let me go
[Interlude]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
[Chorus 3]
Highs and lows
You surround me either way it goes
Should I rise or should I fall
Lord, You're with me through it all, ooh
Highs and lows
In the rhythms of Your grace I know
Should I rise or should I fall
You are faithful through it all
And You're too good to let me go
