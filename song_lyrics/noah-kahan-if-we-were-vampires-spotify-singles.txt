[Verse 1]
It's not the long, flowing dress that you're in
Or the light coming off of your skin
The fragile heart you've protected for so long
The mercy in your sense of right and wrong
It's not your hands searching slow in the dark
Or your nails leaving love's watermark
It's not the way you talk me off the roof
Your questions like directions to the truth
[Chorus]
It's knowing that this can't go on forever
It's likely one of us will have to spend some days alone
Maybe we'll get forty years together
But, one day, I'll be gonе
One day, you'll be gone
[Verse 2]
If wе were vampires, and death was a joke
We'd go out on the sidewalk and smoke
And laugh at all the lovers and their plans
I wouldn't feel the need to hold your hand
Maybe time running out is a gift
I'll work hard 'til the end of my shift
And give you every second I can find
And hope it isn't me who's left behind
[Chorus]
It's knowing that this can't go on forever
It's likely one of us will have to spend some days alone
Maybe we'll get forty years together
But, one day, I'll be gone
And, one day, you'll be gone
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
It's knowing that this can't go on forever
It's likely one of us will have to spend some days alone
Maybe we'll get forty years together
One day, I'll be gone
And, one day, you'll be gone
[Outro]
It's knowing that this can't go on forever
It's likely one of us will have to spend some days alone
Maybe we'll get forty years together
But, one day, I'll be gone
And, one day, you'll be gone
