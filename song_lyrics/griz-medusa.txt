[Verse 1]
Hold up, it's the anthem, put your fuckin' hands up
Smilin' 'cause I'm young, rich, gay, and I'm handsome
Yeah, the fam go deep like scuba
I got a stone cold look like Medusa
Shit you heard about me, that's a rumor
Unless they talkin' how I'm stackin' up the gouda
Smash your mans, throw him back
Grab that ass, yeah throw it back
If you talkin' that shit, get bazooka'd
You no-game ass, lookin' like a blooper
Oh, I'ma go ghost in Bermuda
Got my blessings on fleek, hallelujah
[Chorus]
Throw it back, throw it back, classy
Zoom-a-zoom-a-zoom, don't gas me
Who the fuck are you? Don't ask me
Hot boys, hot boys, nasty
Throw it back, throw it, throw it, throw it back
Throw it back, throw it, throw it, throw it back
Throw it back, throw it, throw it, throw it back
Hot boys, hot boys, nasty
[Drop]
Throw it back, throw it back (Bomba)
Smash your man, throw him back
Ayo GRiZ, run that shit back
Throw it back, throw it back (Bomba)
Throw it back, throw it, throw it, throw it back
[Verse 2]
Snatch your bag, then I share with the whole squad
I'm so bad, I should be outlawed
I just did your mans, made him say "Oh, God"
Now when they see my bag all they say is "Oh, God!"
Yes I'm booked, yes I'm busy
On my clean shit, feelin' like Ricky
Rode a boy, saved a horse, said "Yee-haw"
Me and him make it look like a seesaw
Wu-Tang, ooh baby, he don't like it raw
Give me a beat when I shim-shim-shimmy-ya
[Chorus]
Throw it back, throw it back, classy
Zoom-a-zoom-a-zoom, don't gas me
Who the fuck are you? Don't ask me
Hot boys, hot boys, nasty
Throw it back, throw it, throw it, throw it back
Throw it back, throw it, throw it, throw it back
Throw it back, throw it, throw it, throw it back
Hot boys, hot boys, nasty
Oh God
[Drop]
All they say is, all they say is, all they say is "Oh, God!"
All they say is, all they say is, all they say is "Oh, God!"
All they say is, all they say is, all they say is "Oh, God!"
Smash your man, throw him back
Ayo GRiZ, run that shit back
All they say is, all they say is, all they say is "Oh, God!"
All they say is, all they say is, all they say is "Oh, God!"
All they say is, all they say is, all they say is "Oh, God!"
Now when they see my bag, now when they see my bag
Now when they see my bag, all they say is "Oh, God!"
[Outro]
It's a kiki, it's a kiki, me and GRiZ, yah, we gettin' freaky
It's a kiki, it's a kiki, me and GRiZ, yah, we gettin' freaky
