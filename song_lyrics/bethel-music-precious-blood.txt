[Verse 1: Hannah McClure]
Guardian and keeper of my soul
Laid to rest to make for us a home
Blameless Son and perfect cornerstone
All my sin Your sacred gift atoned
[Chorus: Hannah McClure]
Oh, the precious blood of Christ
How it held me through the night
Oh, it brought me back to life
I am alive by the precious blood of Christ
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 2: Amanda Cook]
Love has paid to make me whole again
My emptiness is filled with Heaven's breath
And that same power that raised You from the dead
That Spirit is alive inside my chest
[Chorus: Amanda Cook & Hannah McClure]
Oh, the precious blood of Christ
How it hеld me through the night
Oh, it brought me back to lifе
I am alive by the precious blood of Christ
Oh, I am alive by the precious blood of Christ
[Bridge: Amanda Cook & Hannah McClure]
And I'm alive, I'm alive to sing it
Oh, I'm alive, I'm alive to bring You praise
You stepped in and took my shame
Now I'm new in every way
By the precious blood of Christ
Oh, I'm alive, I'm alive to sing it
Oh, I'm alive, I'm alive to bring You praise
You stepped in and took my shame
Now I'm new in every way
By the precious blood of Christ
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus: Hannah McClure]
Oh, the precious blood of Christ
How it held me through the night
Oh, it brought me back to life
I am alive by the precious blood of Christ
