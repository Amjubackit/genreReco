[Intro]
Well, I know what you want from me
You want someone to be
Your reflection, your bitter deception
Setting you free
So you take what you want and leave
[Verse 1]
Who made you like this?
Who encrypted your dark gospel in body language?
Synapses snap back in blissful anguish
Tell me you met me in past lives, past life
Past what might be eating me from the inside, darling
Half algorithm, half deity
Glitches in the code or gaps in a strange dream
Tell me you guessed my future and it mapped onto your fantasy
Turn me into your mannequin and I'll turn you into my puppet queen
[Verse 2]
Won't you come and dance in the dark with me?
Show me what you are, I am desperate to know
Nobody better than the perfect enemy
Digital demons make the night feel heavenly
Make it real
'Cause anything's better than the way I feel right now
I can offer you a blacklit paradise
Diamonds in the trees, pentagrams in the night sky
[Verse 3]
Lipstick, chemtrails, red flags, pink nails, with
One eye on the door, other eye on a rail
Other other eye following a scarlet trail
And the last few drops from the Holy Grail, now
Rose gold chains, ripped lace, cut glass
Blood stains on the collar means just don't ask
Be the first to the feast
Let's choke on the past and
Take to the broken skies at last
[Bridge]
(Diamonds in the trees, pentagrams in the night sky)
(Diamonds in the trees, pentagrams in the night sky)
(Diamonds in the trees, pentagrams in the night sky)
(Diamonds in the trees, pentagrams in the night sky)
(Diamonds in the trees, pentagrams in the night sky)
(Diamonds in the trees, pentagrams in the night sky)
(Diamonds in the trees, pentagrams in the night sky)
Diamonds in the trees, pentagrams in the night sky
[Breakdown]
You're gonna watch me ascend
[Verse 4]
And I know what you want from me
You want the same as me
My redemption, eternal ascension
Setting me free
So I'll take what I want then leave
[Outro]
You make me wish I could disappear, no
You make me wish I could disappear
