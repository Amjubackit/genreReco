I was holding my breath
When the tightrope walker slipped into the moon glow
Saying all my children, follow me
Maybe it's time to go
You can be chrome when you're wise
Can be wise when you're blue
And baby, if I have
Then I have for you
Bribing the jury to keep me in jail
Singing 
"Tea for the Tillerman"
And although I lie fantastically
I swore an oath on my history
It's a miracle I can see
You can be wrong when you're right
Even when you're right on cue
And if I die tonight
Then I die for you
Calling on those that call me son
Great grandson and grandson
Great uncles, aunts, and relatives
To judge what I have doneGonna make it right by you
Even if it's all I do
And if it's all I do
Then I do it for you
People will raise a whole lotta hell
About the water and the windmill
And although I stab Quixotically
It hurts no one but me
Even the darkness has arms
But it ain't got you
And baby I have it
And I have you too
And the light in the window
To pass the night through
Maybe so uncertain
But what can I do?
Keepin' it on
Keepin' it on
And I know I like it
But what does that prove?
Sometimes I worry I don't know how to love youI bring to you with reverent hands
All the books that my love abides
Kind woman that my passion wore
Like the shoreline wears the tides
Maybe the water went dry
Keeping an eye on you
And with an eye on you
It could drown me too
People will raise a whole lotta hell
About the water and the windmill
And although I stab quixotically
I swore an oath on my history
It's a miracle I can see
Even the darkness has arms
But they ain't got you
Baby, I have it
And I have you, too
And the light in the window
To pass the night through
Maybe so uncertain
But what can I do?Keepin' it on
Keepin' it on
And I know I like it
But what does that prove?
Sometimes I worry I don't know how to love you
