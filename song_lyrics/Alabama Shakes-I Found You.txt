[Verse 1]
This isn't sometimes
Yeah, it's for always
If I'm gonna love you with all of my heart
And if there is no more time
This always remains
Even as the world spins itself apart
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I remember them days
I waited so patiently
For God to bring someone
Who's gonna be good to me
And then he blessed my soul
[Chorus]
Well, I traveled a long way (I traveled a long, long way)
And it took a long time (It took a long time)
To find you
But I finally found you
[Verse 2]
I remember all them lonely days
I traveled out on my own
Then you brought me everything
And you made my house a home
But if it's not the real deal
Then I don't know it
'Cause it sure does feel
And I think it sure does show
