[Verse 1]
It careened and crashed while the others waved
And you waited in the sun so long when you only wanted shade
Let the old men laugh, let the old men say
That I've never done nothing that wasn't out of love, baby
[Chorus]
Now the weight that you carry seems such a heavy load
While you're face down in the moment waiting to let go
[Verse 2]
Remember standing in the light
Remember crawling all the way
You paraded in the nighttime for a clеan getaway
You were standing in thе water, but only up to your knees
But you know a strong current can always sweep you off your feet
[Chorus]
You were waiting for the right time, but it could take so long
While you're face down in the moment waiting to let go
Face down in the moment waiting to let go
[Verse 3]
You were following the blind
When they stole your name
You were planning a way out
When you lost your way
Bent to a hunch now
Like a broke-down show
Face down in the moment just waiting to let go
[Chorus]
Face down in the moment waiting to let go
Face down in the moment waiting to let go
[Post-Chorus]
Keep waiting
Keep waiting
Keep waiting
[Bridge]
You keep waiting on the night
You keep waiting on your pain
And every moment that you wait now
Is a moment slipped away
I think you're gonna have to come out and face
All the fear you can't explain
And all your life, you've been face down
Now it's time for you to see
All your life, you've been face down
Now it's time for you to see
All your life, you've been face down
Now it's time for you to see
[Refrain]
See it
See it
See it
See it
[Outro]
Face down in the moment waiting to let go
Face down in the moment waiting to let go
