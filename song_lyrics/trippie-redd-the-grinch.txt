[Intro]
Yo Pi'erre, you wanna come out here?
[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, huh, life is like a motherfuckin' dream (Like a dream)
Fill my double cup up with some lean (With some lean)
Yeah, put my dick in your bitch spleen (Bitch spleen)
Yeah, racks comin' in evergreen (Evergreen)
[Chorus]
Yeah, hold up, let me pop my shit
Pussy nigga talkin', we gon' leave him in a ditch
I'll kill my brother, pussy nigga, if he snitch
I was outside being bad with The Grinch
Nigga, bad with The Grinch
[Verse]
Yeah, yeah, trapping out the motherfuckin' Ritz
Yeah, moving bales, nigga, yeah, moving bricks
Fucking on his thot and that bitch a redbone (Redbone)
Yeah, yeah, put the bitch on (On)
I put niggas on like some motherfuckin' cologne
Fuck nigga, yeah, I ain't singing, Post Malone, uh
With the gang, we keep a .57 (Buh-buh)
And you know we keep some MAC-11s
I just love me some lethal weapons
Child of God, I'll send your ass to heaven[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, huh, life is like a motherfuckin' dream (Like a dream)
Fill my double cup up with some lean (With some lean)
Yeah, put my dick in your bitch spleen (Bitch spleen)
Yeah, racks comin' in evergreen (Evergreen)
[Chorus]
Yeah, hold up, let me pop my shit
Pussy nigga talkin', we gon' leave him in a ditch
I'll kill my brother, pussy nigga, if he snitch
I was outside being bad with The Grinch
Nigga, bad with The Grinch
