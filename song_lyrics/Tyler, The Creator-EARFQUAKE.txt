[Intro: Tyler, The Creator & 
Playboi Carti
]
For real, for real this time
For real, for real, for real this time
Bitch, I cannot fall short
For real, for real, for real this time (
Uh, yeah
)
For real, for real, for real this time
[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
'Cause you make my earthquake
Oh, you make my earthquake
Riding around, your love be shakin’ me up
And it's making my heart break
'Cause you make my earthquake (Earthquake, ooh)
Oh, you make my earthquake
Riding around, your love be shakin’ me up
And it's making my heart break
[Refrain: Tyler, The Creator & Charlie Wilson]
Don't leave, it's my fault
Don't leave, it's my fault
Don't leave, it's my fault (Girl)
’Cause when it all comes crashing down I’ll need you
[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator & 
Charlie Wilson
]
'Cause you make my earthquake
Oh, you make my earthquake
Riding around, you’re telling me something is bad
And it's making my heart break
'Cause you make my earthquake, oh, you make my earthquake
(
Earthquake, yeah
)
Riding around, your love be shakin' me up
And it’s making my heart break (
You already know
)
