[Intro]
Oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
[Verse 1]
Oh, her eyes, her eyes
Make the stars look like they're not shinin'
Her hair, her hair
Falls perfectly without her tryin'
She's so beautiful
And I tell her every day
Yeah, I know, I know
When I compliment her, she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me, "Do I look okay?" I say
[Chorus]
When I see your face (Face, face)
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing (Amazing)
Just the way you are (Are)
And when you smile (Smile, smile)
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause, girl, you're amazing (Amazing)
Just the way you are (Are)
Yeah
