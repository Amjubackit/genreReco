[Intro]
(Hmm, babe)
(Hmm, babe)
I could hold you like this all day
Didn't get much sleep, that's okay
Not a single thing needs to change
We can be the light that don't fade away
(Hmm, babe, hmm, babe)
(Hmm, babe, hmm, babe)
[Verse]
I wish you could see what I see when I'm seein' you
(Hmm, babe)
I want you to know how I know that I need you
(Hmm, babe)
No one can do what you do when you get me through
(Hmm, babe)
So I wish you could see what I see when I'm seein' you
(Hmm, babe)
[Chorus]
I could hold you like this all day
Didn't get much sleep, that's okay
Not a single thing needs to change
We can be the light that don't fade
Baby, we can keep our own time
(Hmm, babe)
Forget about what's goin' on outside
(Hmm, babe)
People say that nothin' gold can stay
(Hmm, babe)
We can be the light that don't fade away
(Hmm, babe)
(Hmm, babe, hmm, babe)
(Hmm, babe, hmm, babe)
(Hmm, babe)
(Hmm, babe)
[Verse]
I wish you could see what I see when I'm seein' you
I want you to know how I know that I need you
(Hmm, babe)
No one can do what you do when you get me through
(Hmm, babe)
So I wish you could see what I see when I'm seein' you
(Hmm, babe)
[Chorus]
I could hold you like this all day
Didn't get much sleep, that's okay
Not a single thing needs to change
We can be the light that don't fade
Baby, we can keep our own time
Forget about what's goin' on outside
People say that nothin' good can stay
We can be the light that don't fade away
