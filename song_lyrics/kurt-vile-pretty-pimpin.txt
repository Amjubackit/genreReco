[Verse 1]
I woke up this morning
Didn’t recognize the man in the mirror
Then I laughed and I said, “Oh silly me, that’s just me”
Then I proceeded to brush some stranger’s teeth
But they were my teeth, and I was weightless
Just quivering like some leaf come in the window of a restroom
[Pre-Chorus 1]
I couldn’t tell you what the hell it was supposed to mean
But it was a Monday, no, a Tuesday
No, a Wednesday, Thursday, Friday
Then Saturday came around,
 
and I said
"Who’s this stupid clown blocking the bathroom sink?"
[Chorus 1]
All he ever wanted
Was to be someone in life that was just like
All I want is to just have fun
Live my life like a son of a gun
I could be one thousand miles away
But still mean what I say
[Verse 2]
Then I woke up one morning
Didn’t recognize the man in the mirror
Then I laughed and I said, “Oh silly me, that’s just me”
Then I proceeded to not comb some stranger’s hair
Never was my style[Pre-Chorus 2]
But I couldn’t tell you what the hell it was supposed to mean
'Cause it was a Monday, no, a Tuesday
No, a Wednesday, Thursday, Friday
Then Saturday came around,
 
and I said
“Who’s this stupid clown blocking the bathroom sink?”
But he was sporting all my clothes
I gotta say, pretty pimpin'
[Chorus 2]
All he ever wanted was to be a man
But he was always
A little too cute to be admitted under "marbles lost"
He was always a thousand miles away
While still standing in front of your face
[Verse 3]
Then he woke up this morning
Didn’t recognize the boy in the mirror
Then laughed and said, “Oh silly me, that’s just me”
Then I proceeded to brush some stranger’s teeth
But they were my teeth, and I was weightless
Just quivering like some leaf come in the window of a restroom
[Pre-Chorus 2]
And I couldn’t tell you what the hell it was supposed to mean
'Cause it was a Monday, no, a Tuesday
No, a Wednesday, Thursday, Friday
Then Saturday came around,
 
and I said
“Who’s this stupid clown blocking the bathroom sink?”
But he was sporting all my clothes
I gotta say, pretty pimpin'[Outro]
I woke up this morning
Didn’t recognize the boy in the mirror
I woke up this morning
Didn’t recognize the boy in the mirror
I woke up this morning
Didn’t recognize the boy in the mirror
I woke up this morning
Didn’t recognize the boy in the mirror
I woke up this morning
Didn’t recognize the boy in the mirror
I woke up this morning
Didn’t recognize the boy in the mirror
