[Intro]
Aaaah, aaah
Aaaah, ooh
Oooh
Ooh, aaaah, aaah
Aaaah, ooh
Oooh, ooh
[Verse 1]
If you need me, call me
No matter where you are
No matter how far
Just call my name
I'll be there in a hurry
On that you can depend and never worry
You see, my love is alive
It's like a seed that only needs the thought of you to grow
So if you feel the need for company
Please, my darling, let it be me
[Chorus]
Aah-aah, ooh
Aaah aah
Aaah aah aah
Oooh, ooh
