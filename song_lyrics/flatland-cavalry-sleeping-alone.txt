[Intro]
We’re rolling
Alrighty
[Verse 1]
Counting constellations on the popcorn ceiling
And staring at your picture on the wall
Rays of lonely moonlight slowly slice through the blinds
As the tears begin to fall
[Chorus]
I’m tired of sleeping alone
I just wanna be where you are
Tired of saying goodnight through the phone
And wakin' up each morning in the dark
Better say a prayer
Turn out the light
Sigh and hug my pillow tight
I’ll be with you soon my dear
If only in my dreams
[Verse 2]
Who I am trying to fool, baby? I’m the one to blame
For the forces keeping us apart
I’m stubborn and I’m bold
And work's got me in a stranglehold
Keepin' a vice around my heart
Indifference over distance don’t fare well
Maybe a goodnight kiss from you
Could break me from my spell[Chorus]
'Cause I’m tired of sleeping alone
I just wanna be where you are
Tired of saying goodnight through the phone
And wakin' up each morning in the dark
Better say a prayer
Turn out the light
Sigh and hug my pillow tight
I’ll be with you soon my dear
If only in my dreams
[Bridge]
Ah, here we go again
Off to never never-land
[Outro]
Better say a prayer
Turn out the light
Sigh and hug my pillow tight
I’ll be with you soon my dear
If only in my dreams
Better say a prayer
Turn out the light
Sigh and hug my pillow tight
I’ll be with you soon tonight
If only in my dreams
