[Verse 1]
Behold the One, the radiance
The splendor of every living thing
You are the Word, You are the Life
You are the face of God
[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, You're beautiful
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, You're beautiful
[Verse 2]
Behold the Man of grace and truth
The image of the Father's outstretched hand
This act of love, this sacrifice
We've seen the face of God
[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, You're beautiful
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, You're beautiful
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, You're beautiful
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, You're beautiful, ayy
[Bridge]
Angels cry out this unending song
Holy is the Lord God Almighty
We all bow down in wonder and awe
Forever we will sing of Your beauty
Oh, angels cry out this unending song
Holy is the Lord God Almighty
We all bow down in wonder and awe
Forever we will sing of Your beauty
Oh, angels cry out this unending song
Holy is the Lord God Almighty
We all bow down in wonder and awe
Forever we will sing of Your beauty
[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, You're beautiful (Oh, oh-oh)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, You're beautiful, ayy
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, You're beautiful
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, You're beautiful, ayy
[Outro]
You're beautiful
You're beautiful
