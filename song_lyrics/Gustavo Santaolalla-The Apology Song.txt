[Verse 1: Diego Luna]
Toro
, I am 
humble
, for tonight I understand
Your royal blood was never meant to decorate this sand
You've suffered great injustice, so have thousands before you
I offer an apology and one long overdue
[Chorus: Diego Luna]
I am sorry, Toro I am sorry
Hear my song, I know I sing the truth
Although we were bred to fight
I reach for kindness in your heart tonight
[Post-Chorus: Diego Luna]
And if you can forgive, and if you can forgive
Love can truly live
And if you can forgive, and if you can forgive
Love can truly live
[Verse 2: Diego Luna]
Toro, I am frightened, but I'll use my final breath
To tell you that I'm sorry, let us end this dance of death
Two centuries of agony, that tore your heart with sand
Here and now with my amends, this senseless killing ends
[Chorus: Diego Luna]
I am sorry, Toro I am sorry
Hear my song, I know I sing the truth
Although we were bred to fight
I reach for kindness in your heart tonight
