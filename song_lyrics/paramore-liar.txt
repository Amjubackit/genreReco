[Verse 1]
What was the moment? It's hard to say
I’m sure I don't remember anyway
Before I only knew to hesitate
Pin back in the grenade
[Pre-Chorus]
And all the ways I'd keep you safe
I keep you safe from me
[Chorus]
And, oh, my love, I lied to you
But I never needed to
Oh, my love, I lied to you
But you always knew the truth
[Verse 2]
I got too good at fighting chemicals
And dodgin’ arrows I was asking for
Wading through the fog and then it disappeared
Naked when I'm here
[Pre-Chorus]
And why (And why) should I (Should I) deny what's all
At once so crystal clear?
[Chorus]
And, oh, my love, I lied to you
But I nevеr needed to
Oh, my love, I lied to you
But you always knеw the truth
[Bridge]
Love is not an easy thing to admit
But I'm not ashamed of it
Love is not a weakening if you feel it rushin' in
Don't be ashamed of it
Mm, love is not an easy thing to admit
But I'm not ashamed of it
Mm, love is not a weakening if you feel it rushin' in
Don’t be ashamed of it
[Chorus]
And, oh, my love, I lied to you
But I never needed to
Oh, my love, I lied to you
But you always knew the truth
And, oh, my love, I lied to you
But I never needed to
Oh, my love, I lied to you
But you always knew the truth
