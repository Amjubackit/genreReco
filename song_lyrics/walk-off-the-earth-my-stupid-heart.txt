[Intro: Sarah Blackwood & Gianni Luminati]
My stupid heart don't know
I've tried to let you go
So many times before
Then wound up at your door
My stupid—
[Verse 1: Sarah Blackwood]
Can't believe that I haven't figured out by now
Every time I call you up all you do is let me down
Should've known there was nothing 'bout us I could change
Every time we try to be friends it always ends the same
[Pre-Chorus: Sarah Blackwood]
But when I try to remember
All the pain that we've been through
Something in me says "whatever"
And it brings me back to you
[Chorus: Both, 
Sarah Blackwood
 & 
Gianni Luminti
]
My stupid heart
 don't know
I'vе tried to let you go
So many times bеfore
Then wound up at your door
My stupid heart, too late
Already on my way
If we go down in flames
Again, then you can blame my stupid heart, 
-eart, -eart[Post-Chorus: Sarah Blackwood & 
All
]
Oh, shit!
Okay!
You can blame my stupid heart-eart-eart, heart
Oh, shit!
Okay!
You can blame my stupid—
[Verse 2: Gianni Luminati]
Every now and then I get inside of my head
Try to leave your texts unread but I wind up here instead
I should've bit my tongue while we were still ahead
I always had to be right 'til we had nothing left
[Pre-Chorus: Gianni Luminati]
But when I try to remember
All the pain that we've been through
Something in me says "whatever"
And it brings me back to you
[Chorus: Gianni Luminati & Sarah Blackwood, 
Gianni Luminati
]
My stupid heart don't know
I've tried to let you go
So many times before
Then wound up at your door
My stupid heart, too late
Already on my way
If we go down in flames
Again, then you can blame my stupid heart, 
-eart, eart[Post-Chorus: Gianni Luminati & 
All
]
Let's go!
 (
Oh, shit!
)
Uh, uh, uh
 (
Okay!
)
You can blame my stupid heart-eart-eart, heart
I've tried to let you go (
Oh, shit!
)
So many times before (
Okay!
)
You can blame my stupid heart-eart
Too late, already on my way (Oh, shit!)
If we go down in flames (Okay!)
Again, then you can blame my stupid heart
[Outro: Sarah Blackwood & 
Gianni Luminati
]
Too late, already on my way
If we go down in flames
Again, then you can blame my stupid heart
