Remember when our songs were just like prayers
Like gospel hymns that you called in the air
Come down, come down, sweet reverence
Unto my simple house and ring
And ring
Ring like silver, ring like gold
Ring out those ghosts on the Ohio
Ring like clear day wedding bells
Were we the belly of the beast or 
the sword that fell
We’ll never tell
Come to me, clear and cold, on some sea
Watch the world spinning waves, mad machine
Now I’ve been crazy couldn’t you tell
I threw stones at the stars, but the whole sky fell
Now I’m covered up in straw, belly up on the table
Well I drank and sang, and passed in the stable
That tall grass grows high and brown
Well I dragged you straight in the muddy ground
And you sent me back to where I roam
Well I cursed and I cried, but now I know
Now I know
