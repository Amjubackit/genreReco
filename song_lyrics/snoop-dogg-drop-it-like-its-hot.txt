[Intro]
Snoop
Snoop
[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
When the pimp's in the crib, ma
(Drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot)
When the pigs try to get at you
(Park it like it's hot, park it like it's hot, park it like it's hot)
And if a nigga get a attitude
(Pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot)
I got the Rollie on my arm and I'm pourin' Chandon
And 
I roll the best weed
, 'cause I got it goin' on
[Verse 1: Pharrell Williams]
I'm a nice dude (Uh), with some nice dreams
 (Yep)
See these ice cubes? (Uh) 
See these Ice Creams?
Eligible bachelor, million dollar boat
That's whiter than what's spillin' down your throat
The Phantom, exterior like fish eggs
The interior like suicide-wrist red
I can exercise you, this can be your Phys. Ed
Cheat on your man,
 
ma, that's how you get ahizzead
Killer with the beat,
 
I know killers in the street
With the steel that'll make you feel like Chinchilla in the heat
So don't try to run up on my ear talkin' all that raspy shit, tryna ask me shit
When my niggas fill your vest, they ain't gon' pass me shit
You should think about it, take a second *Ding*
Matter-fact, you should take four, B
And think before you fuck with-a 
lil' Skateboard P
