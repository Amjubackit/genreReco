[Verse 1]
The enemy came up against your home
The enemy came up against your children
The enemy came up against your name
The enemy came up against your character
[Chorus]
(Despite it, what it looks like)
You will win, win
You will win, win
[Verse 2]
The enemy came up against your health
The enemy came up against your finance (your finance)
The enemy came up against your vision
The enemy came up against your business
[Chorus]
(Despite it, what it looks like)
You will win, win
You will win, win
You will win, win
You will win, win
I know you're hurt
I know you're torn
I know you're broken but
You will win
All of those may be facts
But the truth still remains
That in the name of Jesus
You will win!
