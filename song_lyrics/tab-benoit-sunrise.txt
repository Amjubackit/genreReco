I watch the sunrise alone again
And I'm beginning to think that that's my only friend
You find me every day, keep me warm
Yes, that's the only thing I can always count on
With your eyes in the sky
As you travel 'round this world
You're the only one that can find my girl
And when you do tell her I love her
I'm thinking of her and I was wrong
We've been fighting over nothing
Shine your light longer
So she could find her way back home
With your eyes up in the sky
As you travel 'round this world
I say you're the only one that can find my girl
And when you do tell her I love her
That I'm thinking of her and I was wrong
We've been fighting over nothing
Shine your light, baby
So she could find her way back home
