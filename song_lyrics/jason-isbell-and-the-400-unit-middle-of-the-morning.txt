[Verse 1]
Well, I tried to open up my windows
And let the light come in
I step outside in the middle of the morning
And in the evening again
[Verse 2]
Yes, I tried to be grateful for my devils
And call them by their names
But I'm tired by the middle of the morning
And I need someone to blame
[Chorus 1]
I know you're scared of me, I can see it in your face
I can feel it in the way you move around this place
I know you're scared of me, I can see it in your smile
Like an unattendеd child you can't quite trust
[Verse 3]
But I'm tired of steppin' on your shadow
And feeling in thе way
Yes, I'm tired by the middle of the morning
I'm out of shit to say
[Chorus 2]
I ain't used to this, seein' everybody's hand
I was raised to be a strong and silent Southern man
I ain't used to this, a thousand days alone
In my bed or in my head or in my phone[Verse 4]
Yes, I'm tired of livin' in the moment
And sleeping through the dream
I step outside in the middle of the morning
And the roses hear the scream
[Chorus 3]
I know you're scared of me, so I never get too close
I sit here on the tailgate like a farmhand's ghost
Watch the roses bloom, watch 'em wilt away and die
'Til I notice I've been cryin' this whole time
[Verse 1]
Well, I tried to open up my windows
And let the light come in
I step outside in the middle of the morning
And in the evening again
