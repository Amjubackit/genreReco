[Verse 1]
Silly of me to think that I
Could ever have you for my guy
How I love you
How I want you
Silly of me to think that you
Could ever really want me too
How I love you
[Chorus]
You're just a lover out to score
I know that I should be looking for more
What could it be in you I see?
What could it be?
Oh, love, oh, love, stop making a fool of me
Oh, love, oh, love, stop making a fool of me
[Verse 2]
Silly of me to think that you
Could ever know the things I do
Are all done for you
Only for you
Silly of me to take the time
To comb my hair and pour the wine
And know you're not there
[Chorus]
You're just a lover out to score
And I know that I should be looking for more
What could it be in you I see?
What could it be?
Oh, love, oh, love, stop making a fool of me
Oh, love, oh, love, stop making a fool of me
[Instrumental Break]
[Refrain]
Ooh, hoo, hoo, hoo
[Verse 3]
Silly of me to go around
And brag about the love I found
And say you're the best
Well, I can't tell the rest
And foolish of me to tell them all
That every night and day you call
When you could care less
[Chorus]
You're just a lover out to score
And I know that I should be looking for more
What could it be in you I see?
What could it be?
Oh, love, oh, love, stop making a fool of me
Oh, love, oh, love, stop making a fool of me, uh-huh
[Outro]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, silly
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, silly, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, silly, yeah, yeah
Ooh, ooh, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, silly, yeah, yeah
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, silly, yeah, yeah
Ooh
