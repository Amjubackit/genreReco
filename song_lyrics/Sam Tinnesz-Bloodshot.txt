[Verse 1]
Focus on my insides
Doctor says I'm alright
Gotta keep it locked tight
If I'm gonna survive
Don't know what to tell you
Suffer through the volume
Maybe I'm a fool but
I can't wrap my mind around why
[Pre-Chorus]
I take all of the fear in waves
Suffocating in cellophane
Somebody put me away
Put me away before I break
[Chorus]
I'll take another hit to the backbone
I'm picking up the heat like an atom bomb
No time on the clock, it's a bloodshot
Three, two, one
You got me bloodshot
I'll take another hit to the backbone
I'm picking up the heat like an atom bomb
No time on the clock, it's a bloodshot
Three, two, one
You got me bloodshot
