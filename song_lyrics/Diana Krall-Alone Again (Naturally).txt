[Verse 1: Diana Krall]
In a little while from now
If I'm not feeling any less sour
I promised myself to treat myself
And visit a nearby tower
And climbing to the top
To throw myself off
In an effort to make it clear to whoever
What it's like when you're shattered
Left standing in the lurch
At a church with people saying
"My God that's tough
She stood him up
No point in us remaining
We may as well go home"
As I did on my own
Alone again, naturally
[Verse 2: Michael Bubl√©]
To think that only yesterday
I was cheerful, bright and gay
Looking forward to, who wouldn't do
The role I was about to play
And as if to knock me down
Reality came around
And without so much as a mere touch
Cut me into little pieces
Leaving me to doubt
Talk about God and His mercy
Oh, if He really does exist
Why did He desert me?
In my hour of need
I truly am indeed
Alone again, naturally
