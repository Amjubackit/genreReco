[Verse 1]
Beat me up, beat me down
Mess me up beyond all recognition
For what it's worth, I'd do it again
With no consequence, I will do it again
Hard up, so hunt me down, down, down
Jump the gun, bust a cap, hit the ground!
[Verse 2]
Yo, yo, yo, word
My dignity's never returned
Perceived like a big fat jerk
I've been silly, but not absurd
Criminal, that's what I herd
Thinking thoughts that's most impure
No efforts expenditured
I'm just that soup de jourâ€™d
[Chorus]
On the fence, the consequence
What do they know about that?
On the track, ahead of the pack
What do they know about that?
I'm quite impressed, I'm quite a mess
[Verse 1]
Beat me up, beat me down
Mess me up beyond all recognition
For what it's worth, I'd do it again
With no consequence, I will do it again
Hard up, so hunt me down, down, down
Jump the gun, bust a cap, hit the ground!
