[Verse 1]
Were you honest when you said
"I could never leave your bed"?
Wake me up and let me know you're alive
And will you fall in love again?
Is the scent slowly spreading?
I've been answering machines all night
Now the doctors' dancing in
While the ambulances sing
Another boy without a sharper knife
[Chorus]
The moment, that's where I
Kill the conversation, wrap this up
With a knife that loves to feel
How do you know how deep to go before it's real?
[Verse 2]
Take me home
Can I even complicate your breathing?
I guess I'm just your average boy
This is me with a knife in the back
And a grip on the grass
It's cold and I don't want to be here
I guess I'm never comfortable or situational
Are we losing or beginning
To try a new life without you?[Chorus]
The moment, that's where I
Kill the conversation, wrap this up
With a lie that I'm enjoying every minute with myself
[Verse 3]
And she could make hell feel just like home
So I'm never leaving her alone
But if your lightning lips aren't mine
Then I don't know the awkward stranger to my right
But she's crying
I only need one hand to drive (When you're with me)
You are my getaway
(Oh no)
[Bridge]
And don't you ever feel alone?
And don't you wish you were home?
Cut the lust tonight
Alright, alright tell me why
My little Mona Lisa told a lie, lie, lie, lie
[Outro]
Do you want me?
Do you want to let me know that you're okay?
A diamond gold ring
Customized to cut your circulation
But I couldn't let you go
No, I never let you go, my dear
So keep talking, 'cause I love to hear your voice
(To hear your voice, to hear your) Voice again
