[Verse 1]
She wants to get married, she wants it perfect
She wants her granddaddy preachin' the service
And she wants magnolias out in the country
Not too many people, save her daddy some money
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Ooh, she got it all planned out
Yeah, I can see it all right now
[Chorus 1]
I'll wear my black suit, black tie, hide out in the back
I'll do a strong shot of whiskey straight out the flask
I'll try to make it through without crying so nobody sees
Yeah, she wanna get married
But she don't wanna marry me
[Verse 2]
I remember the night when I almost kissed her
Yeah, I kinda freaked out, we've been friends for forever
And I'd always wonder if she felt the same way
When I got the invite, I knew it was too late
[Pre-Chorus 2]
And I know her daddy's been dreading this day
Oh, but he don't know he ain't the only one giving her away
