[Verse 1]
I can hear her heart beat for a thousand miles
And the heavens open everytime she smiles
And when I come to her that's just where I belong
Yet I run into her like a river's song
[Chorus]
She gives me love, love, love, love, crazy love
She gives me love, love, love, love, crazy love
[Verse 2]
She's got a fine sense of humor when I'm feeling low down
And when I come to her when the sun goes down
Takes away my trouble, takes away my grief
Takes away all of my heartache in the night like a thief
[Chorus]
She gives me love, love, love, love, crazy love
She gives me love, love, love, love, crazy love
[Bridge]
Yes, I need her in the daytime
Oh, but I need her in the night
Yes, I want to throw my arms around her
Kiss and hug her, kiss and hug her tight
[Verse 3]
And when I'm returning from so far away
She gives me some sweet lovin', brightens up my day
Yes, it makes me righteous, it makes me feel whole
And it makes me mellow down into my soul
[Chorus + Outro]
She gives me love, love, love, love, crazy love
She gives me love, love, love, love, crazy love
She gives me love (love, love, love, love, crazy love)
I need love, love, love, love, crazy love (love, love, love, love, crazy love)
Crazy love
Crazy love
Crazy love
