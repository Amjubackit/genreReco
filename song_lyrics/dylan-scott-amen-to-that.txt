[Intro]
Amen to that
Amen to that
[Verse 1]
There's a sunset setting by a stain glass sky
Man I ain't much for confessions but I gotta testify
That I fell for an angel in a rocky top hat
Amen, Amen to that
[Verse 2]
She got them sky blue eyes, baptized in the dirt
She got conviction in her kiss that'll take it to church
Takes my demons and my troubles, puts 'em all in the past
Amen, Amen to that
[Chorus]
Hallelujah, praise the good Lord
For giving me the woman I've been praying for
I was lost in the night, she put a light on my path
Amen, Amen to that
[Verse 3]
She's got my momma saying, "you don't know how lucky you are"
She got a sanctifiеd soul you don't find in a bar
Yeah I've come a long way from sitting way in thе back
Amen, Amen to that
[Chorus]
Hallelujah, praise the good Lord
For giving me the woman I've been praying for
I was lost in the night, she put a light on my path
Amen, Amen to that
Amen, Amen to that
[Bridge]
Ain't it funny how He finds a way to make it all work
Sometimes He'll take you through hell to show you Heaven on earth
It's the redemption in her arms, no it ain't on a map
Amen, Amen to that
[Chorus]
Hallelujah, praise the good Lord
For giving me the woman I've been praying for
I was lost in the night, she put a light on my path
Amen, Amen to that
Amen, Amen to that
(Amen to that)
(Amen to that)
(Amen to that)
