[Verse 1]
There in the days when your heart
Feels like it's caving in
So there the peace begins
Sure as the dawn calls the sun
Jesus we hear Your love
Call out the light in us
[Chorus]
Life like You meant it
I can't contain it
Hope in the here and now
What a wide horizon
In the rush of Heaven
Life like You made it
I wanna live it
Wilder than all my dreams
Such a great adventure
Welcome to the future
[Verse 2]
There will be days when you find
You can't believe your eyes
Faith brings your world to life
Breathe in the air, it's a gift
Come on just let it in
Your best days are still ahead[Chorus]
Life like You meant it
I can't contain it
Hope in the here and now
What a wide horizon
In the rush of Heaven
Life like You made it
I wanna live it
Wilder than all my dreams
Such a great adventure
Welcome to the future
[Interlude]
[Chorus]
Life like You meant it
I can't contain it
Hope in the here and now
What a wide horizon
In the rush of Heaven
Life like You meant it
I wanna live it
Wilder than all my dreams
Such a great adventure
Welcome to the future[Tag]
I know who holds
I know who holds, who holds
I know who holds tomorrow
[Outro]
Wilder than all my dreams
Such a great adventure
Welcome to the future
