[Part I]
[Intro: Aretha Franklin]
I know I can't afford to stop for one moment
That it's too soon, to for—
[Chorus: JID]
Push the fucking pack off of the porch or break a pound down
Get this strap, if it happen to blow, it make surround sounds
Pussycat on my lap, push it back and go to town down
Putting rap on my back and I'm black and snatchin' crowns
[Verse 1: JID]
I done came back around like a nigga sellin' crack in pounds
I got a bag now but it's nothing to brag 'bout
Gun blast in the background
I'm a black man with the bloodhounds
MAC-10, making love sounds
To a bad chick, she from Uptown
I'm from down South
, not a loudmouth
We can fuck around (Woah, shit, woah)
Hit the music, baby, cut it down (Woah, shit, woah)
Hit a 
doobie
 while you do me indubitably
I feel like I'ma bust now (Woah, woah, shit, woah)
I feel like a bust down when I shine bright
Blind niggas is up now (Woah, shit, woah, shit)
In the cut, big black truck, pack sacked up
You can pick it up now, nigga, fuck it, okay (Ayy)[Chorus: JID]
Push the fucking pack off of the porch or break a pound down
Get this strap, if it happen to blow, it make surround sounds
Pussycat on my lap, push it back and go to town down
Putting rap on my back and I'm black and snatchin' crowns
[Interlude: Aretha Franklin]
I know I can't afford to stop for one moment
That it's too soon, to for—
[Verse 2: 21 Savage]
Me and my money attached emotionally
I get to clutchin' if you get too close to me
I'm at the top where I'm 'posed to be
Jumped in the game, niggas act like they coaching me
Four hundred racks ain't shit but a show to me
I'm on the road and I bet that your ho with me
When I'm in traffic, it's always a pole wit' me
Pillsbury man, I keep dough with me
Hit from the back
She giving me slurp and I ain't even pull my pants down
Jump in the box and slide to the other side, it's always a man down
Draw down, hands in the air, nigga
Make one move, get gunned down
Giving out smoke so long
They don't even wanna talk no more, they just run now
No locked doors, I serve with a chop
Bitch got spent, she was hanging with an opp
We call him Mickey, he talks to the cops
I was on Pinedale, glass in the sock
Back in the day, I invest in the block
Fast forward, now I'm investing in stocks
I put a drum on the Heckler and Koch
Don't play 'cause I'm very invested in shots[Chorus: JID]
Push the fucking pack off of the porch or break a pound down
Get this strap, if it happen to blow, it make surround sounds
Pussycat on my lap, push it back and go to town down
Putting rap on my back and I'm black and snatchin' crowns
[Bridge: Baby Tate]
I put the pussy cat in his face 'cause he stay off Cheshire Bridge
Then I took it back, now he say that he shakin' and he shiverin'
Like the way it taste and he ain't ate it in a minute
They call me Yung Baby, but I still got hella chil—
[Part II]
[Intro: JID]
Talk shit, run that motherfuckin' crown, you bitch
You motherfuckin' bitch
Uh, shit (Hehehaha)
[Verse 3: JID]
Sorry in advance for my bros
They'll whoop a nigga ass, what you whippin' up? (Woah)
JID in the back if you lookin' for the dope
Niggas got it in the bag, 'cause we trappin' on the low
And I'm the shit with the flow, huh
Give me a joke, heard a nigga say that you the next? No, no, no
I'm the best, tell them bitches stop the motherfuckin' press
Press stop, fuck a top-five list
Get ‘em a vest, he get lopsided
Fuck the cops, we was runnin' from Rottweilers
Most of my partners ain't have poppa, just a popped condom, couple kids with Alzheimer's
.40 on his side, boy, you Mike Alstott, he on the block violent
Robbin' niggas in the hood and then swap genres
Green light, line a nigga up, stop sign him
Keep drivin', you will not find him
I'm a, I'm a, I'm an-I'm an anomaly, I turned into a rapper ironically
And ran the bag up, back up, niggas is onto me
Niggas should honor me
If you think I'm a wannabe, it's pretty comedy
I'm melancholy and cool, so calmly bustin' moves
My truths carry velocity
Same posse since OshPosh B'gosh, pussy clot
Treat the rappin' like I'm pushin' rock
On the stove with the Pyrex pot
The door stay locked, it don't say knock
We on they block, we own they block
It's Monopoly games, we stole they properties
Smooth talkin' and moonwalkin'
The same lil' niggas small pond, but a pool shark
I aim, big stick, knock, chalk off cue balls
Bang this shit[Outro]
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
Ah, ha-ha-ha-ha!
