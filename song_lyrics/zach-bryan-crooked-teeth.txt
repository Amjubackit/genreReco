[Verse 1]
If two fill-ups is all it costs I guess I'll make the drive
Down past the Texas line to make sure he's not alive
They dumped him off of a river bridge in the fall of '84
Word got around that he climbed out of that muddy red river floor
[Verse 2]
Lost my bride to the finest man she claims to have ever known
When she got to the parkin' lot his knees were already blown
Love is such a mighty drug, a mightier disease
Bet he misses her floatin' past the barge
With one eye and crooked teeth
One eye and crooked teeth
One eye and crooked teeth
One eye and crooked teeth
[Chorus]
Your crooked teeth are floatin' and my lady's restin' fine
Seven miles out of Bismarck next to Bakken oil lines
I laid her down so softly and so kindly reassured
Love it ain't for tamin', a disease that can't be cured
[Verse 3]
And I'll drive through Colorado on a rocky stretch of road
With no one who loves me as far as telephone poles go
I wish I was a trusting man, but a trusting man is weak
The only thing worth trusting is some brass through crooked teeth
Some brass through crooked teeth
Some brass through crooked teeth
[Chorus]
Your crooked teeth are floatin' and my lady's restin' fine
Seven miles out of Bismarck next to Bakken oil lines
I laid her down so softly and so kindly reassured
Love it ain't for tamin', a disease that can't be cured
[Verse 4]
Lost my bride to the finest man she claims to have ever known
When she got to the parkin' lot his knees were already blown
Love is such a mighty drug, a mightier disease
Bet he misses her floatin' past the barge
With one eye and crooked teeth
