[Chorus]
I drink alone
Yeah, with nobody else
I drink alone
Yeah, with nobody else
Yeah, you know, when I drink alone
I prefer to be by myself
[Verse 1]
Now, every morning, just before breakfast
I don't want no coffee or tea
Just me and my good Buddy-Weiser
That's all I ever need
[Chorus]
â€˜Cause I drink alone
Yeah, with nobody else
Yeah, you know, when I drink alone
I prefer to be by myself
[Verse 2]
Yeah, the other night I laid sleepin'
And I woke from a terrible dream
So I called up my pal Jack Daniel's
And his partner, Jimmy Beam
[Chorus]
And we drank alone
Yeah, with nobody else
Yeah, you know, when I drink alone
I prefer to be by myself
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Verse 3]
Yeah, the other day I got invited to a party
But I stayed home instead
Just me and my pal, Johnnie Walker
And his brothers, Blackie and Red
[Chorus]
And we drank alone
Yeah, with nobody else
Yeah, you know, when I drink alone
I prefer to be by myself
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Verse 4]
Yeah, my whole family done give up on me
And it makes me feel oh-so bad
The only one who will hang out with me
Is my dear Old Grand-Dad
[Chorus]
And we drink alone
Yeah, with nobody else
Yeah, you know, when I drink alone
I prefer to be by myself
[Outro]
Yeah, you know, when I drink alone
I prefer to be by myself
I drink alone
