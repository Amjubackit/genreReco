[Verse]
Father of kindness
You have poured out grace
You have brought me out of darkness
You have filled me with peace
Giver of mercy
You're my help in time of need
Lord, I can't help but sing
[Chorus]
Faithful, You are
Faithful, forever You will be
Faithful, You are
All Your promises are "Yes and Amen"
All Your promises are "Yes and Amen"
[Verse]
Beautiful Savior
You have brought me here
You pulled me from the ashes
You have broken every curse
Blessed Redeemer
You have set this captive free
Lord, I can't help but sing
[Chorus]
Faithful, You are
Faithful, forever You will be
Faithful, You are
All Your promises are "Yes and Amen"
All Your promises are "Yes and Amen"
Faithful, You are
Faithful, forever You will be
Faithful, You are
All Your promises are "Yes and Amen"
All Your promises are "Yes and Amen"
