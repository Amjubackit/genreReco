[Chorus]
I'll be your role model
Don't leave the house tomorrow
I gotta meet with Audemars
Tell me what you want
You say you had enough 'cause my time ain't enough
Girl, it's never enough for you
But you can wait until after tomorrow
Flawless, lawless, baby, what you call this?
If this shit don't involve money, I'm off it
I can be your role model, 
Jimi Hendrix
Pop a pill with me
 before we end it
[Verse 1]
No more Ghosts, 
Wraiths or GT3s (No)
No more award shows, no MTV (No)
So you always double-back after you leave? (Oh)
Bitch, where you gon' go after you been with me?
I done seen it all 'fore I turned twenty-three
I could teach you how to ball if you just let a nigga be
We be so high, that's why we so low-key
She wanna fly out with you, let's make three
[Chorus]
I'll be your role model
Don't leave the house tomorrow
I gotta meet with Audemars
Tell me what you want
You say you had enough 'cause my time ain't enough
Girl, it's never enough for you
But you can wait until after tomorrow
Flawless, lawless, baby, what you call this?
If this shit don't involve money, I'm off it
I can be your role model, Jimi Hendrix
Pop a pill with me
 before we end it[Verse 2]
Uh, us against the globe
Don't let your attitude ruin what we got
Never stressing if you just lay low
I'll give you lessons, it's so much to know
Go full speed when I say go (Go)
Don't push me when I say no
Yeah, it don't look cheap 'cause it cost O's
And you can't book me less than M for a show
[Chorus]
I'll be your role model
Don't leave the house tomorrow
I gotta meet with Audemars
Tell me what you want
You say you had enough 'cause my time ain't enough
Girl, it's never enough for you
But you can wait until after tomorrow
Flawless, lawless, baby, what you call this?
If this shit don't involve money, I'm off it
I can be your role model, Jimi Hendrix
Pop a pill with me
 before we end it
[Outro]
You say you had enough 'cause my time ain't enough
And it's never enough for you
But you can wait until after tomorrow
