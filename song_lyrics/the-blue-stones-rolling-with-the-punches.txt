[Verse 1]
Been a long time, been a long time
Wrestled to the dirt, now I'm back on my grind
I took a trip to the borderlines and I doused my head
In some upstream brine
Saw a man in a two-tone coat
Told me everything he liked about the songs I wrote
Turned his head and to my surprise
He had fire on his tongue and green in his eyes
[Pre-Chorus]
(Ooh) I won't let him get the best of me, no
(Ooh) Take the money, just leave me be, oh
[Chorus]
Hey, I've been rollin' with the punches
Hey, I've been rollin' with the punches
Hey, I've been rollin' with the punches
Hey, I've been rollin' with the punches
[Verse 2]
Been a long time, been a long time
Look into my eyes, tell me, what do you find?
I had enough with you missin' deadlines
Demon with a dollar's been wasting my time
Send him back to his fiery hole
Take him to the cleaners with a sword of brimstone
And tell the rest of your hungry dogs
That I've got a new weapon just to rule them all[Pre-Chorus]
I need your help like I need blood loss
Words are for the weak with an empty cause
Give me what I want or I'll take it for myself, yeah
[Chorus]
Hey, I've been rollin' with the punches
Hey, I've been rollin' with the punches
(Come on)
[Chorus]
Hey, I've been rollin' with the punches
Hey, I've been rollin' with the punches
Hey, I've been rollin' with the punches
Hey, I've been rollin' with the punches
