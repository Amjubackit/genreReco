[Verse 1: Joel Houston]
People, come together
Strange as neighbours
Our blood is one
Children of generations
Of every nation
Of kingdom come
[Chorus: Joel Houston, Taya Gaukrodger, and Jad Gillies]
Don't let your heart be troubled
Hold your head up high
Don't fear no evil
Fix your eyes on this one truth
God is madly in love with you
So take courage, hold on
Be strong
Remember where our help comes from
[Refrain]
Oh, oh, oh, woah, woah
[Verse 2: Jad Gillies, Taya Gaukrodger, and Joel Houston]
Jesus, our redemption
Our salvation
Is in His blood (hey)
Jesus, Light of heaven
Friend forever
His kingdom come
[Chorus: Joel Houston, Taya Gaukrodger, and Jad Gillies]
And don't let your heart be troubled
Hold your head up high
Don't fear no evil
Fix your eyes on this one truth
God is madly in love with you
So take courage, hold on
Be strong
Remember where our help comes from
[Refrain]
Oh, oh, oh, woah, woah
[Bridge: Taya Gaukrodger w/ everyone]
Swing wide all you heavens
Let the praise go up as the walls come down
All creation
Everything with breath repeat the sound
All His children
Clean hands, pure hearts
Good grace, Good God
His name is Jesus
Swing wide all you heavens
Let the praise go up as the walls come down
All creation
Everything with breath repeat the sound
All His children
Clean hands, pure hearts
Good grace, Good God
His name is Jesus
Swing wide all you heavens
Let the praise go up as the walls come down
All creation
Everything with breath repeat the sound
All His children
Clean hands, pure hearts
Good grace, Good God
His name is Jesus
[Outro: Jad Gillies, Taya Gaukrodger, and Joel Houston]
Jesus, our redemption
Our salvation
Is in His blood
Jesus, Light of heaven
Friend forever
His kingdom come
