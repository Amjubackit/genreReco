[Intro]
Rumbling, rumbling
It's coming
Rumbling, rumbling
Beware
Coming for you
[Verse 1]
All I ever wanted to do was do right things
I never wanted to be the king, I swear
All I ever wanted to do was save your life
I never wanted to grab a knife, I swear (Swear)
[Pre-Chorus]
(I'm) Tearless, (I'm) Fearless
(I'm) Burning, (I'm) Burning
You tell me what have I missed?
Still wandering in the deep mist
[Chorus]
If I lose it all, slip and fall
I will never look away
If I lose it all, lose it all, lose it all
If I lose it all outside the wall
Live to diе another day
I don't want anything
I'm just here to
Bеware
