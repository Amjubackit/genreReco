[Bryan Garris]
Flashes of blood and bone
An empty vessel in between its home
It wraps around my feet
Pooling like wet cement, I sink
Clawing to get away
But every branch I hold onto breaks
Where do I go from here?
Panic sets in and I start to shake (Shake)
Loathing
Crushed by the weight of the terror
All life reduced to stone
A beam of light pulls you above the ground
Out of the water through the parted clouds
All life reduced to stone
I am withеring at the helm
Suffocating, and overwhеlmed
I hand you to god
Carve your name
Everything burns
Nothing remains[
Matt King
]
We are gathered here today
Under the pressure of a weary gaze
Hydrate the garden
Decorate the grave
Lowered beneath the dirt
[Bryan Garris]
The trumpet toils for the blood I harvest
Flashes of blood and bone
An empty vessel in between its home
God knows I belong to hell
That's why he left me here by myself
God Knows
