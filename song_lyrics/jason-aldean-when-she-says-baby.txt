[Verse 1]
Some days it's tough just gettin' up
Throwin' on these boots and makin' that climb
Some days I would rather be a no show or lay low
'Fore I go out of my mind
[Chorus]
But when she says baby (Baby)
Oh, no matter what comes, ain't goin' nowhere
She runs her fingers through my hair
And saves me (Saves me)
Yeah, that look in her eye's got me comin' alive
And drivin' me a good kind of crazy
When she says baby
Oh, when she says baby
[Verse 2]
Some nights I come home fightin' mad
Feel like runnin' my fist through the wall
Is it even worth what I'm fightin' for anymore?
Feelin' torn, aw, to hell with it all
[Chorus]
But when she says baby (Baby)
Oh, no matter what comes, ain't goin' nowhere
She runs her fingers through my hair
And saves me (Saves me)
Yeah, that look in her eye's got me comin' alive
And drivin' me a good kind of crazy
When she says baby[Bridge]
Everything gon' be alright
Just lay down by my side
Let me love you through this life
[Verse 3]
Yeah, she's a perfect shot of faith
When every bit of mine is gone
Somethin' I can believe in, a best friend
A Heaven-sent love to lean on
[Chorus]
But when she says baby (Baby)
Oh, no matter what comes, ain't goin' nowhere
She runs her fingers through my hair
And saves me (Saves me)
Yeah, that look in her eye's got me comin' alive
And drivin' me a good kind of crazy
When she says baby
Oh, when she says baby
[Outro]
Yeah, that look in her eye's got me comin' alive
And drivin' me a good kind of crazy
