[Verse 1]
Where can I run from Your presence?
Where can I flee from You?
Even if I hide on the highest mountain
You are there
Where can I run from Your presence?
Where can I flee from You?
Even if I lie in the lowest valley
You will find me there
[Chorus]
Deeper than any ocean
Your love goes on and on and on and on
Higher than any mountain
Your love goes on and on and on and on
Your love goes on and on and on and on
[Verse 2]
And if I clothe myself in shadow
Would I fade away from You?
No, even if I fall to the deepest darkness
Love surrounds me still
No, even if I fall to the deepest darkness
Your love surrounds me still
[Chorus]
Deeper than any ocean
Your love goes on and on and on and on
Higher than any mountain
Your love goes on and on and on and on
Deeper than any ocean
Your love goes on and on and on and on
Higher than any mountain
Your love goes on and on and on and on
Your love goes on and on and on and on[Bridge 1]
There is no ending to Your
Love that holds on and won't let go
Love that won't leave me on my own
I'm falling deeper into Your
Love that holds on and won't let go
Love that won't leave me on my own
There is no ending to Your
Love that holds on and won't let go
Love that won't leave me on my own
I'm falling deeper into Your
Love that holds on and won't let go
Love that won't leave me on my own
[Chorus]
Deeper than any ocean
Your love goes on and on and on and on
Higher than any mountain
Your love goes on and on and on and on
Deeper than any ocean
Your love goes on and on and on and on
Higher than any mountain
Your love goes on and on and on and on
Your love goes on and on
Your love goes on and on and on and on
Your love goes on
Your love goes on and on
Your love goes on[Bridge 2]
Love, don't let me go, don't let go
Love, don't let me go, don't let go
Love, don't let me go, don't let go
Love, don't let me go, don't let go
[Bridge 3]
There's nowhere I could run
There's nowhere I could hide
There's nowhere I could go that You won't find me, Lord
There's nowhere I could run
There's nowhere I could hide
There's nowhere I could go that You won't find me, Lord
There's nowhere I could run
There's nowhere I could hide
There's nowhere I could go that You won't find me, Lord
There's nowhere I could run
There's nowhere I could hide
There's nowhere I could go that You won't find me, Lord
[Outro]
Love, don't let me go, don't let go
Love, don't let me go, don't let go
Love, don't let me go, don't let go
Love, don't let me go, don't let go
