[Verse 1]
You have become the voice in my head
Only recourse we're left after death
Your viscera welcome me in
Welcome me in
My life is torn, my bones, they bleed
My metaphors fall short in the end
Your flesh and bone welcome me in
Welcome me in
(Are you in pain like I am?)
[Pre-Chorus]
Will we remain stuck in the throat of gods?
Will the pain stop if we go deeper?
[Chorus]
So lеt's get swallowed whole
I wanna go whеre nobody else will
Ever go
[Verse 2]
Walls of flesh, so warm again
We step into my suffering
My only need
Welcome me in
Welcome me in
[Refrain]
There is always something in the way
I wanna have you to myself for once
Follow me between the jaws of fate
So I can have you to myself for once
[Chorus]
So let's get swallowed whole
I wanna go where nobody else will
Ever go
[Refrain]
There is always something in the way
I wanna have you to myself for once
[Outro]
Are you in pain like I am?
Are you in pain like I am?
Are you in pain like I am?
Are you in pain like I am?
