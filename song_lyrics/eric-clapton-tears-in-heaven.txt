[Verse 1]
Would you know my name if I saw you in heaven?
Would it be the same if I saw you in heaven?
[Chorus]
I must be strong and carry on
‘Cause I know I don't belong here in heaven
[Verse 2]
Would you hold my hand if I saw you in heaven?
Would you help me stand if I saw you in heaven?
[Chorus]
I'll find my way through night and day
‘Cause I know I just can't stay here in heaven
[Bridge]
Time can bring you down, time can bend your knees
Time can break your heart, have you begging please
Begging please
[Instrumental Break 02:34-02:57]
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Beyond the door, there's peace, I'm sure
And I know there'll be no more tears in heaven
[Verse 3]
Would you know my name if I saw you in heaven?
Would you be the same if I saw you in heaven?
[Chorus/Outro]
I must be strong and carry on
'Cause I know I don't belong here in heaven
