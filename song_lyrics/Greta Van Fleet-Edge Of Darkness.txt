[Verse 1]
Every day's a new day
Every way's a new way
On the edge of darkness, finding out what it means to love
And to think we've found the time
[Chorus]
All my brothers we stand for the peace of the land
Is there meaning?
I've got love in my heart for an army apart
I am bleeding
All my brothers we stand for the peace of the land
Is there meaning?
I've got love in my heart for an army apart
I am bleeding
[Verse 2]
Always searching for love
Always searching for light
What the world is made of when I'm thinking it's right?
And to think we've found the time
[Chorus]
All my brothers we stand for the peace of the land
Is there meaning?
I've got love in my heart for army apart
I'm bleeding
All my brothers we stand for the peace of the land
Is there meaning?
I've got love in my heart for an army apart
I am bleeding
