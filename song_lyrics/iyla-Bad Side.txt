[Chorus]
I've been saving this question
I fear that your answer
Will teach me a lesson about love
The trash side of love
The crass side of love
The mad side of love
I've been saving this question
I know that your answer
Will teach me a lesson about love
The shit side of love
The whack side of love
The bad side of love
[Verse 1]
I'm two feet in, you're one foot out
We took the steps, but you led with doubt
I fill you up, rain on your drought
You drink me in, but you drown me out
'Cause you're keeping secrets
Some skeletons creepin'
In closets buried deep in rooms that we sleep in
[Chorus]
So I've been saving this question
I fear that your answer
Will teach me a lesson about love
The trash side of love
The crass side of love
The mad side of love
I've been saving this question
I know that your answer
Will teach me a lesson about love
The shit side of love
The whack side of love
The bad side of love
