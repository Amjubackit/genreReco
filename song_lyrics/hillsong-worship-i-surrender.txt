[Verse 1]
Here I am
Down on my knees again
Surrendering all
Surrendering all
Find me here
Lord as You draw me near
I'm desperate for You
I'm desperate for You
I surrender
[Verse 2]
Drench my soul
As mercy and grace unfold
I hunger and thirst
I hunger and thirst
With arms stretched wide
I know You hear my cry
Speak to me now
Speak to me now
[Chorus]
I surrender, I surrender
I want to know You more
I want to know You more
I surrender, I surrender
I want to know You morе
I want to know You more (Ooh)
[Interlude]
I want to know You more
More of You, lеss of me
[Bridge]
Like a rushing wind
Jesus, breathe within
Lord, have Your way
Lord, have Your way in me (Oh)
Like a mighty storm
Stir within my soul
Lord, have Your way
Lord, have Your way in me
Like a rushing wind
Jesus, breathe within
Lord, have Your way
Lord, have Your way in me
Like a mighty storm
Stir within my soul
Lord, have Your way
Lord, have Your way in me (Yeah)
[Interlude]
Oh, yes Lord
(Oh, we're desperate for You)
Fully completely, Lord
(Oh, we're desperate for You)
[Outro]
Like a rushing wind
Jesus, breathe within
Lord, have Your way
Lord, have Your way in me
Like a mighty storm
Stir within my soul
Lord, have Your way
Lord, have Your way in me
