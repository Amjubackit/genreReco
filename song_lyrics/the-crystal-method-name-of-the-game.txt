Listen, all you motherfuckers
Listen, all you motherfuckers
That's the name of the game
That's the name of the game
That's the name of the game
That's the name of the game
Yo, topple the crown, rape the queen
The fatal mistake in your cradle, can't shake the dreams
Of fire inside of your phonograph, battered with gas
And give you room to breathe through an adequate mask
Everybody in front, let me see ya pumpin' ya fists
If you up in the back room, when you rockin' with this, come on
Keepin' ya speaker knockin', jumpin', bangin'
Bumpin' blazin' hot, callin' all freaks
Callin' all freaks now
Yo, yo, callin' all—
Callin' all freaks now
That's right
That's the name of the game
That's the name of the game
That's the name of the game
That's the name of the game
Callin' all freaks
Callin' all freaks
Callin' all—
Callin' all—
That's right
Get 'em up in the back room
Get 'em up in the back room
I said, get 'em up in the back room
Motherfucker
Callin' all—
Callin' all—
Callin' all—
Callin' all—
Callin' all—
Callin' all—
Callin' all—
Callin' all—
That's the name of the game
Calling all freaks
That's the name of the game
Calling all freaks now
That's the name of the game
Yo, yo, calling all freaks
That's the name of the game
Calling all freaks now
