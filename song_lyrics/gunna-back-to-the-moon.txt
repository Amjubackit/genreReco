[Chorus]
If you don't fuck with me, don't do what I do
Think he the one, but he really the two
Better get low when I hit at your crew
I'm sendin' the cleaners through
I'm barely not sober
, they thinkin' it's over, you niggas ain't seen my move
They sat me down like I went outerspace, 
now I gotta go back to the moon
[Verse 1]
Nigga right back on the shrooms
Nigga geeked up like it ain't nun' to lose
Two months, I'm back on the move
Right back in the club throwin' racks in the pool
I'm 'bout to start actin' a fool
It's just you and me, and you know who I choose
You knew this would happen, you cut off the crew
I'm talkin' to me and not you
I missed out on millions and millions, that money is gone
Ain't get no compensation, ain't no conversation for niggas, we ready to roll
Let's get back to that basic, main reason they fakin' 'cause I done been fuckin' they hoes
Only reason you said it 'cause these niggas said it, you suckin' the dick and the toes
[Verse 2]
You get caught, gotta know how it go
'Cause this shit could get tricky fasho
Rich enough to get put in a hole
Got a crew but I been all alone
I been drivin' the car from the back takin' pictures and pieces in back of the Rolls
And I think these lil' boys wanna cook somethin', let's crank up the beef and get back to the shows
In Miami, we BP the boat
Put the bulletproof back on the road
Been a minute, it's been so long
Ever wondered that I was doin' wrong
I said, "Hold up, I'm switchin' up the tone"
Man, these niggas couldn't see me with the song
If these niggas done never see me, probably wouldn't even be rappin' all along
And Young Gunna didn't get a season, these niggas'll never put it on
I can't start back at where was needed
Yeah, I know y'all, Wun-Wunna put me on
Kept it cool but it got me heated
And I'm 'bout to show 'em how it go
At the river, I show 'em how it flow
At the show, and they know my M-O[Chorus]
If you don't fuck with me, don't do what I do
Think he the one, but he really the two
Better get low when I hit at your crew
I'm sendin' the cleaners through
I'm barely not sober, they thinkin' it's over, you niggas ain't seen my move
They sent me down like I went outer space, now I gotta go back to the moon
[Verse 3]
Nigga, back over the trees
Niggas still rollin', we back on the east
I'm still havin' soldiers that handle the needs
The venegance is givin' them ease
You talkin' at rats and you all with that cheese, we havin' some lemon squeeze
I let your BM do whatever I please, you know she do good on her knees
I finally discovered the breeze
I'm glad I can see I'm the one they discussin'
It ain't 'bout that money, you got me disgusted
You like it, then he gotta love it
He hope I stood down just to get up and close to a nigga 'cause I'm up above it
My homie keep beggin' to clean up a couple of niggas, but ain't really budgin'
Gotta watch for the law, so I really can't talk to you niggas, but fuck it
I'm a real boss and I gotta be cautious 'cause niggas don't keep it a hunna
It ain't my fault that I had to fall out with you niggas, but fuck it
Ain't havin' time to be talkin', rest of them niggas, come see me in public
You can't be trustin', you gotta watch out for these people
This shit'll get ugly, and you can be lucky if you can look out for your people
When he ain't have nothin' and tried to make somethin', we lookin' for hay through a needle
When you ever fall down and your back hit the ground, better pray to the Gods you don't need 'em[Chorus]
If you don't fuck with me, don't do what I do
Think he the one, but he really the two
Better get low when I hit at your crew
I'm sendin' the cleaners through
I'm barely not sober, they thinkin' it's over, you niggas ain't seen my move
They sent me down like I went outer space, now I gotta go back to the moon
