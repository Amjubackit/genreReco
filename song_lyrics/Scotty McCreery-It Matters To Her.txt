[Verse 1]
When you say I love you
Before you hang up the phone
When you buy her favorite wine
On your way home
When you kiss her in the kitchen
When you kiss her on the street
When you kiss her when she’s still asleep
[Chorus]
It matters to her
It stays on her mind
When you put her first
Every single time
When you think she don’t see
When you think she don’t care
When you think she don’t notice
What you’re doing there
Every littlе look
Every single word
Oh it matters to hеr
[Verse 2]
When you pull her in close
When she’s had a bad day
When you shut up and listen
To what she has to say
When you tell her she’s stronger
Than the storm blowing in
When you’re there when she just needs a friend
