[Verse 1: Baker, Baker & Bridgers, All]
It's a bad idea and I'm all about it
Give it one more chance and
Then I finally had it
When you wake up, I'll be gone again
Motorcycle in the front lawn
[Verse 2: Baker, Baker & Dacus, Baker & Bridgers, All]
It's an all-night drive from your house to Reno
To the T-bird graveyard where we play with fire
In another life, we were arsonists

Pushing the flowers that come up
Into the front of a shotgun
So many hills to die on
[Outro: Baker, Dacus, Bridgers]
Run out of gas, out of time, out of money
You're doing what you can, just makin' it run
(Take a break, make your escape)
Gas, out of time, out of money
You're doing what you can, just makin' it run
(There's only so much I can)
(Take a break, make your escape)
(May I please have twenty dollars?)
Gas, out of time, out of money
You're doing what you can, just makin' it run
(There's only so much I can)
(Take a break, make your escape)
(Can you give me twenty dollars?)
Gas, out of time, out of money
You're doing what you can, just makin' it run
(There's only so much I can)
(Take a break, make your escape)
Gas, out of time, out of money
You're doing what you can, just makin' it run
(There's only so much I can)
(Take a break, make your escape)
(I know you have twenty dollars)
(I know you have twenty dollars)
[Outro: Baker]

I still have to change, have to change, have to change
Wait on me, I'm not ready
I still have to change, have to change, have to
