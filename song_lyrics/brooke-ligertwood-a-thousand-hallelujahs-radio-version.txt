[Verse 1]
Who else would rocks cry out to worship?
Whose glory taught the stars to shine?
Perhaps creation longs to have the words to sing
But this joy is mine
[Chorus]
With a thousand hallelujahs we magnify Your name
You alone deserve the glory, the honor and the praise
Lord Jesus, this song is forever Yours
A thousand hallelujahs and a thousand more
[Verse 2]
Who else would die for our redemption?
Whose resurrection means I'll rise?
There isn't time enough to sing of all You've done
But I havе eternity to try
[Chorus]
With a thousand hallelujahs wе magnify Your name
You alone deserve the glory, the honor and the praise
Lord Jesus, this song is forever Yours
A thousand hallelujahs and a thousand more
[Bridge]
Praise to the Lord, to the lamb
To the King of Heaven
Praise for He rose, now He reigns
We will sing forever
Praise to the Lord, to the lamb
To the King of Heaven
Praise for He rose, now He reigns
We will sing forever[Chorus]
With a thousand hallelujahs we magnify Your name
You alone deserve the glory, the honor and the praise
Lord Jesus, this song is forever Yours
A thousand hallelujahs and a thousand more
