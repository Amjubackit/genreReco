Whenever I hear goodbyes, reminds me baby of you
I break down and cry, next time I'll be true
Fever for lost romance reminds me baby of you
I took a crazy chance, next time I'll be true
I'll be true
I'll be true
Footsteps on the dance floor, remind me baby of you
Teardrops in my eyes, next time I'll be true
Whispers in the powder room, she cries on every tune
Every tune
Every tune
Every tune
Every tune
And the music don't feel like it did when I felt it with you
Nothing that I do or feel ever feels like I felt it with you
And the music don't feel like it did when
I felt it with you (felt it with you)
Nothing that I do or feel ever feels like
I felt it with you (felt it with you)
And the music don't feel like it did when
I felt it with you (felt it with you)
Nothing that I do or feel ever feels like
I felt it with you (felt it with you)
And the music don't feel like it did when
I felt it with you (felt it with you)
Nothing that I do or feel ever feels like
I felt it with you (felt it with you)
