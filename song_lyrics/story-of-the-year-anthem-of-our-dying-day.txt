[Verse 1]
The stars will cry
The blackest tears tonight
And this is the moment that I live for
I can smell the ocean air
And here I am
Pouring my heart onto these rooftops
Just a ghost to the world
That's exactly
Exactly what I need
[Chorus]
From up here the city lights burn
Like a thousand miles of fire
And I'm here to sing this anthem
Of our dying day
[Verse 2]
For a second I wish the tide
Would swallow every inch of this city
As you gasp for air tonight
I'd scream this song right in your face
If you were here
I swear I won't miss a beat
'Cause I never
Never have before[Chorus]
From up here the city lights burn
Like a thousand miles of fire
And I'm here to sing this anthem
Of our dying day
[Post-Chorus]
Of our dying day
Of our dying day
Of our dying
[Bridge]
For a second I wish the tide
Would swallow every inch of this city
And you gasp for air tonight
[Chorus]
From up here the city lights burn
Like a thousand miles of fire
And I'm here to sing this anthem
Of our dying day
From up here the city lights burn
Like a thousand miles of fire
And I'm here to sing this anthem
Of our dying day
From up here the city lights burn
Like a thousand miles of fire
And I'm here to sing this anthem
Of our dying day[Post-Chorus]
Our dying day
Of our dying
