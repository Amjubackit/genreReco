[Verse 1]
Standin' in the doorway
Silhouette on the wall
Connected to your body
Physical and spiritual
[Pre-Chorus]
And you know what I need
From my crown to my feet
Oh, please, baby, please
Before I fall to my knees
[Refrain]
Tell me how you like it
I just wanna try it
Tease me, but provide it
You got me excited
[Chorus]
But don't rush
That's that feeling I need more of
Sho nuff, babe
But don't rush
That's that feeling I need more of
Sho nuff, babe
