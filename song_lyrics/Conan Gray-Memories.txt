[Intro]
One, two
[Verse 1]
It's been a couple months
That's just about enough time
For me to stop crying when I look at all the pictures
Now I kinda smile, I haven't felt that in a while
It's late, I hear the doorbell ringin' and it's pourin'
I open up that door, see your brown eyes at the entrance
You just wanna talk, and I can't turn away a wet dog
[Pre-Chorus]
But, please, don't ruin this for me
Please, don't make it harder than it already is
I'm trying to get over this
[Chorus]
I wish that you would stay in my memories
But you show up today, just to ruin things
I wanna put you in the past 'cause I'm traumatized
But you're not lettin' me do that, 'cause tonight
You're all drunk in my kitchen, curled in the fetal position
Too busy playing the victim to be listening to me when I say
"I wish that you would stay in my memories"
In my memories, stay in my memories
