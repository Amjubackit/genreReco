[Verse 1]
I know who I am, and I know who I'm not
I know the difference between the two and that tells me a lot
I know who's on thе throne, on the throne of my lifе
He tell me all the wrong lefts, and when to go right
[Pre-Chorus]
He's a King, He's a God, He's the biggest
He's the truth, He's the light, He's the realest
When He tells me He loves me I feel it
Ain't nobody on this earth that can steal it, so I'm
[Chorus]
Feelin' sure, feelin' clear, feelin' positive (Said I'm feelin', feelin')

So l made up in my mind, smile more, stress less
Gave it all to God, and He gave me a blessin'
[Pre-Chorus]

[Bridge]
Aww, you think I'm 'bout to fail, nah
That wall is just an obstacle, I'm 'bout to scale y'all
A testament I got to tell faith I'm 'bout to flex on 'em
Study for the test on 'em
Positive my God can do the rest
[Pre-Chorus]
He's a King, He's a God, He's the biggest
He's the truth, He's the light, He's the realest
