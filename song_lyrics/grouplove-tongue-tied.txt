[Intro]
Oh!
[Verse 1]
Ooh
Take me to your best friend's house
Goin' 'round this roundabout, oh yeah
Oh, take me to your best friend's house
I loved you then and I love you now, oh yeah
[Chorus]
Don't take me tongue-tied
Don't wave no goodbye
Don't break
[Verse 2]
Oh, take me to your best friend's house
Marmalade, we're making out, oh yeah
Oh, take me to your best friend's house
I loved you then and I love you now
[Chorus]
Don't take me tongue-tied
Don't wave no goodbye
Don't break
