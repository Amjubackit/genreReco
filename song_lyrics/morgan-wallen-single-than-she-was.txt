[Verse 1]
She had two beers on the counter when I found her
That neon wrapped right around her like a smokey halo
We talked for almost an hour over sours
I told the girl, "Tell me how you're in this bar all alone?"
She said she was meetin' someone, seein' someone
But all I know is he didn't show when
[Chorus]
She let me buy her a drink
She even stole a sip of mine
She drug me front of the stage
Danced on my boots 'til closin' time
I got her numbеr and name
I ain't sayin' her and her mans got any plans on brеakin' up
But I'll tell you what
She's a little more single than she was
She's a little more single than she was
[Verse 2]
I bet he'll blame all the traffic
Tell her he got distracted
But I'll tell you right now that gal's body was actin'
Like she was missin' somethin'
Like he just isn't someone that learned from the last time
Maybe that's why
