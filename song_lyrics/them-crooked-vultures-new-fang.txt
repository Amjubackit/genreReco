[Verse 1]
New fang, no thing, had it made
To parade, found a sucker, now I want another
Stand up, step aside, open wide
Hangin' out another 'til the feeling's gone
Want to? Yes, I do
Found a love, takin' turns gettin' carpet burns
Loose lips, lipstick spit
Come and go, I think it's both, I gotta know
[Chorus]
Sometimes you break a finger on the upper hand
Think you've got me confused for a better man
Sometimes you break the finger on the upper hand
Say you've got me confused, oh
I ain't a better man
[Verse 2]
No slack, Cadillac, couldn't quit
Gums flap, so here's your teeth back
Accept what I left
Far behind in a time when my mind was like a landmine
Tailgate by the lake
Too much, too young, every button gonna come undone
Tightrope, no joke
Nothing left so you go baroque
[Chorus]
Sometimes you break a finger on the upper hand
Said you got me confused with a better man
Sometimes you break the finger on the upper hand
I know you got me confused
[Interlude]
Oh
[Instrumental Break]
[Outro]
Look out, what I've
New fang pressing down low
No more waiting around for
New fang pressing down, ah
No more waiting around, oh
New fang, new fang
They ain't gonna wait, no
New fang, new, oh
Ain't gonna wait no more
