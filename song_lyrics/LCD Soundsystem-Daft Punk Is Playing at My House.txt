[Verse 1]
Well, Daft Punk is playing at my house, my house
I'll show you the ropes kid, show you the ropes
I got a bus and a trailer at my house, my house
I'll show you the ropes kid, show you the ropes
I bought fifteen cases for my house, my house
All the furniture is in the garage
Well, Daft Punk is playing at my house, my house
You got to set them up kid, set them up
[Chorus]
You got to set 'em up, ooh ooh yeah
You got to set 'em up, ooh ooh yeah
You got to set them up, set them up
[Verse 2]
Well, Daft Punk is playing at my house, my house
I waited 7 years and 15 days
There's every kid for miles at my house, my house
And the neighbors can't call the police
There's a fist fight brewin' at my house, my house
Because the jocks can't get in the door
When Daft Punk is playing at my house, my house
You got to set them up kid, set them up
[Chorus]
You got to set 'em up, ooh ooh yeah
You got to set 'em up, ooh ooh yeah
You got to set them up, set them up
You got to set 'em up, ooh ooh yeah
You got to set 'em up, ooh ooh yeah
You got to set them up, set them up
