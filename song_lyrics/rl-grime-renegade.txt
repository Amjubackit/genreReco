[Chorus]
What did you believe you'd found out?
It all begins when we get afraid
Why do you believe it now?
It's just the whims of a renegade
'Cause you think we'll all let it go
And now you buy your own lie
But now you've lost all credibility
Now you're just the enemy
[Build]
But now you've lost all credibility
Now you're just the enemy
[Drop]
Now you're just the enemy
[Chorus]
What did you believe you'd found out?
It all begins when we get afraid
Why do you believe it now?
It's just the whims of a renegade
'Cause you think we'll all let it go
And now you buy your own lie
But now you've lost all credibility
Now you're just the enemy
[Build]
But now you've lost all credibility
Now you're just the enemy
[Drop]
[Chorus]
What did you believe you'd found out?
It all begins when we get afraid
Why do you believe it now?
It's just the whims of a renegade
'Cause you think we'll all let it go
And now you buy your own lie
But now you've lost all credibility
Now you're just the enemy
