[Verse 1]
Hey you, hey you, Devil's little sister
Listening to your twisted transistor
Hold it between your legs
Turn it up, turn it up
Low end is coming through
Can't get enough
[Pre-Chorus]
A lonely life, where no one understands you
But don't give up, because the music do
Music do!
Music do!
Music do!
Music do!
Music do!
Music do!
[Chorus]
Because the music do
And then it's reaching
Inside you, forever preaching
Fuck you, too
Your scream's a whisper
Hang on, you twisted transistor
