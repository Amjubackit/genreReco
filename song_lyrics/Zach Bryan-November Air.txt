[Verse 1]
You remember sittin' there
One rainy night in a well-used chair
Tellin' me how well you used to dance
The western wind will come again
And make you feel like you did
When all those cowboys didn't stand a chance
[Verse 2]
Said his life took most of you, gave you twice and the day was through
You said it all turned out awfully fair
So tell me tales of all the times and all the seasons you got by
Breathin' in that cold November air
[Refrain]
When no one was there
No one was there
When no one was there
[Verse 3]
Two kids 'bout twenty-three
And the sunsets you'll never see
You were yellin' "supper" from the yard
And they grew old and sailed away
Called you on phones from far away
Wrote you novels on postcards
