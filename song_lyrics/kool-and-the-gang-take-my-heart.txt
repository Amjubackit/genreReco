Has there ever come a time when you feel real nice and you want to let someone know that you really appreciate them?
All you have to do is moan a little bit for me
It goes something like this
Oooh, oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh, oooh
You see, no time for wasting, baby
We've gone all through those moves
I'm offering satisfaction, darling
Girl, I'm giving you all my love
Anytime is the right time, baby
Come on and take my heart
It's all yours if you want it, baby
My heart is tearing all apart
I say oooh.  (You can have it)
Yeah.  (If you want it.)
But if you want it, you can have it
See, darling, there's no time for wasting, baby
Come on, please make up your mind
Good loving is so pleasing, baby
Girl, I'm giving you all my time
You can have it if you want it
Just come and get it and baby, it's yours, yeahI've got it to give
And if you want it, I know that you're gonna love it
So come on, girl
Oh, I knew you'd like it
Oh baby, you got me saying something like
Oooh, oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh, oooh.  Listen now
One night while I was sleeping, baby
Had a dream of you and I
Found myself asking you, baby
To take my hand and be my wife
There's no time for wasting, baby
'Cause we've all gone through those moves
'Cause I'm offering satisfaction, darling
Girl, I'm giving you all my love
You can have it, yeah, if you want it, girl
(If you want it.) Ahhh, yeah, yeah
(You can have it) You, baby, you really want my loving
(If you want it.) It's all yours, baby
(You can have it) You can have it any time of the day
(If you want it.) Don't matter what place it is, you can get it, baby
(You can have it) Oh yeah.  Come on, girl, and get it
(If you want it.) If you want it, you can have it, don't you know that
(You can have it) 'Cause I will make you feel alright
(If you want it.) Oh baby, can't you tell that at least
(You can have it) Come on, girl
(If you want it.) Come on, girl.  Ahhh, yeah, yeah
(You can have it) Come on, darling, satisfaction guaranteed
(If you want it.) Oh baby.  (Take my heart.)
Oooh, oooh, oooh.  (You can have it)
