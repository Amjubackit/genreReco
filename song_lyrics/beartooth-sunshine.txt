[Intro]
Aah, I'm like actually losing my voice though
[Verse 1]
Killing my time in the dark inside
It's a race to death for me
Try and unwind while I lose my mind
I got no place to be
[Pre-Chorus]
The cold winds blowing
The lights not showing
Excuses piling up
I can't keep running
The end is coming
I think I need some
I think I need some
[Chorus]
Sunshine that would finally show
I might die if I stay in this cold
And I finally admit it
I gotta be committed
To let this story unfold
I hear angels calling my name and
I better listen before I implode
I don't care for a minute
If no one's gonna get it
Let's try selling our souls
Let's try selling our souls
Let's try selling our souls
[Verse 2]
Living in filth
Can't look at myself cause I know what I'm gonna see
The spirit I lost
The years it cost
The reasons I'm scared to sleep
[Pre-Chorus]
The room is spinning
The clock keeps ticking
I've finally had enough
I can't keep running
The end is coming
I think I need some
I think I need some
[Chorus]
Sunshine that would finally show
I might die if I stay in this cold
And I finally admit it
I gotta be committed
To let this story unfold
I hear angels calling my name and
I better listen before I implode
I don't care for a minute
If no one's gonna get it
Let's try selling our souls
[Breakdown]
The end is coming
The end is coming
The end is coming
I can't keep running
The end is coming
I think I need some
I think I need some
[Chorus]
Sunshine that would finally show
I might die if I stay in this cold
And I finally admit it
I gotta be committed
To let this story unfold
I hear angels calling my name and
I better listen before I implode
I don't care for a minute
If no one's gonna get it
Let's try selling our souls
