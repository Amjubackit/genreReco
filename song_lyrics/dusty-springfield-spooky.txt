[Verse 1]
In the cool of the evening
When everything is gettin' kind of groovy
You call me up and ask me
Would I like to go with you and see a movie
First I say no, I've got some plans for the night
And then I stop
And say "all right"
Love is kinda crazy with a spooky little boy like you
[Verse 2]
You always keep me guessin'
I never seem to know what you are thinking
And if a girl looks at you
It's for sure your little eye will be a-winkin'
I get confused, I never know where I stand
And then you smile
And hold my hand
Love is kinda crazy with a spooky little boy like you
Spooky
[Verse 3]
If you decide someday to stop this little game that you are playing
I'm gonna tell you all the things my heart's been a-dyin' to be saying
Just like a ghost you've been a-hauntin' my dreams
But now I know
You're not what you seem
Love is kinda crazy with a spooky little boy like you[Outro]
Spooky, spooky, oh whoa, all right
Spooky, oh yea yea
I said Spooky yea yea
