[Verse 1]
When I was searching
Your love was never far
You made a way to get to me
You were the whisper
Leading me to Your heart
Forever I belong to You
[Pre-Chorus]
Now I can see clearly
My God You are for me
You won't let go
[Chorus]
Your love won't let me down
And I know it's true
Yeah, I know that Your
Love is all around
I believe in You
Holding on to You
Holding on and I know You will never fail
I want all of You
You never change
Your love won't let me down
Love won't let me down
[Instrumental]
[Post-Chorus]
Love won't let me
Love won't let me
[Verse 2]
Right when I need You
You listen as I pray
You'd leave the ninety-nine for me
You paint the sky with
Promises of Your grace
So I would find my way to You
[Pre-Chorus]
Now I can see clearly
My God You are for me
You won't let go
[Chorus]
Your love won't let me down
And I know it's true
Yeah, I know that Your
Love is all around
I believe in You
Holding on to You
Holding on and I know You will never fail
I want all of You
You never change
Your love won't let me down
Love won't let me down
[Instrumental]
[Post-Chorus]
Love won't let me
Love won't let me
[Outro]
Holding on and I know You will never fail
I want all of You
You never change
Your love won't let me down
Love won't let me
