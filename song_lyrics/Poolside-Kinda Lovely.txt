[Verse 1]
I am lying here with you
I sat, messin' round with you
[Chorus]
Ooh, babe, you're kinda lovely
Ooh, babe, you're kinda lovely
Ooh, babe, you're kinda lovely
Ooh, babe, you're kinda lovely
[Verse 2]
Starin', looking straight at you
Floatin', floatin' up with you (floatin' up with you)
[Chorus]
Ooh, babe, you're kinda lovely
Ooh, babe, you're kinda lovely
Ooh, babe, you're kinda lovely
Ooh, babe, you're kinda lovely
[Post-Chorus]
And you already know (already know)
And you already know (already know)
Already know (already know)
Ooh, babe, you're kinda lovely
