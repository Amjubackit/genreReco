[Verse 1]
For so long, 
I have waited
So long that I almost became
Just a stoic statue
, fit for nobody
And I don't wanna get in your way
But I finally think I can say
That the vicious cycle was over
The moment you smiled at me
[Chorus]
And just like the rain
You cast the dust into nothing
And wash out the salt from my hands
So touch me again
I feel my shadow dissolving
Will you cleanse me with pleasure?
[Verse 2]
It's that chemical cut that I can get down with
Up like the moon and out like the hounds
A dangerous disposition somehow
Refracted in light, reflected in sound
I'm coiled up like the venomous serpent
Tangled in your trance and I'm certain
You have got your hooks in me
And I know, I know the way that it goes
You get what you give, you reap what you sow
And I can see you in my fate
And I know, I know I am what I am
The mouth of the wolf, the eyes of the lamb
So darling, will you saturate?
