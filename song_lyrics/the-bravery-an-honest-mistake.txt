[Verse 1]
People, they don't mean a thing to you
They move right through you, just like your breath
But sometimes, I still think of you
And I just wanted to, just wanted you to know
My old friend
[Pre-Chorus]
I swear I never meant for this
I never meant
[Chorus]
Don't look at me that way
It was an honest mistake
Don't look at me that way
It was an honest mistake, an honest mistake
[Verse 2]
Sometimes, 
I forget I'm still awake
I fuck up and say these things out loud
My old friend
[Pre-Chorus]
I swear I never meant for this
I never meant[Chorus]
Don't look at me that way
It was an honest mistake
Don't look at me that way
It was an honest mistake, an honest
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
Don't look at me that way
It was an honest mistake
Don't look at me that way
It was an honest mistake, an honest mistake
