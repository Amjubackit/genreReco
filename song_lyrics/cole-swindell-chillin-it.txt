[Chorus]
I got my shades on, top back
Rollin' with the music jacked
One on the wheel, one around you baby
[Verse 1]
Little sun left to burn in the blue sky
Shinin' off the cross hangin' from the mirror of my ride
Breeze blowin' in, your hair blowin' round
You're scanning through the stations lookin' for that country sound
The good stuff iced up in the back seat
Nowhere to go, nowhere to be
[Chorus 2]
I got my shades on, top back
Rollin' with the music jacked
One on the wheel, one around you baby
Sunset I bet there's a chance we can get
Sure enough tangled up laid back and lazy
Pour it on easy now don't spill a bit
Nothing but time tonight, let's get to killin' it
Long as I'm rockin' with you girl
You know I'm cool with
Just chillin' it
[Verse 2]
Nothing but two lane country on up ahead
Girl you so fine, I wouldn't mind if this is all we did
You got me high on kisses
You got me missin' signs
Hard lookin' left when my world is on my right[Chorus 2]
I got my shades on, top back
Rollin' with the music jacked
One on the wheel, one around you baby
Sunset I bet there's a chance we can get
Sure enough tangled up laid back and lazy
Pour it on easy now don't spill a bit
Nothing but time tonight, let's get to killin' it
Long as I'm rockin' with you girl
You know I'm cool with
Just chillin' it
[Bridge]
Nothing like a little you and me low key
Right now I'm right where I wanna be
[Chorus 2]
I got my shades on, top back
Rollin' with the music jacked
One on the wheel, one around you baby
Sunset I bet there's a chance we can get
Sure enough tangled up laid back and lazy
Pour it on easy now don't spill a bit
Nothing but time tonight, let's get to killin' it
Long as I'm rockin' with you girl
You know I'm cool with
Just chillin' it[Outro]
Yeah I love rockin' with you and girl
We're just chillin' it
