[Verse 1]
I haven't got a penny haven't got a dime
But I know how to have a good old time
I ain't got a dollar baby when I do
Gonna go and spend it all on you
When we get the money we can run away
And sing a little song 'bout yesterday
They're never gonna catch me long as I'm alive
You and me together we'll survive
[Verse 2]
Honey in the pantry put it in the tea
And stir it with a spoon for you and me
Sitting in the parlor waiting for your ma
You're the best gal I ever saw
When we get the money we can run away
I don't give a holler what they say
Never gonna find us till the day we die
You and me together we'll get by
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 3]
Putting your dress and looking mighty fine
Lacquerin' my shoes until they shine
You can have my heart if I can have your hand
I can make your daddy understand
I haven't got a penny haven't got a dime
But I know how to have a good old time
I ain't got a dollar baby when I do
Gonna go and spend it all on you
