[Intro]
Oh baby
[Verse 1: Mahalia]
I know what you did
Yeah, I know, I know
And I wanna talk 'bout it
And I know you don't
I been holding guard for so long, so long
And I don't know where to start, I don't know where to start
Tell me where you hide, where do you go?
Tell me is she nice, does she know I know?
Tell me why you lie, tell me why
I don't know what you are, I don't know what you are, no
[Chorus: Mahalia]
What you did
Yeah, you know I love you but I can't forgive it
You could tell me stay, but I have to go
'Cause I would not expect someone to stay around
If I let them down, oh
[Verse 2: Ella Mai]
Oh, it's funny how
Right when I let my guard down
You play around
And no, not this time, we can't hash it out
It's too late for me to stay
I wish all the things you say was what your behaviour displayed
But, no, I could've done without lies, lies
And although I know love is blind, blind
This just don't feel right
Ain't no more we, ain't no more you with me
[Chorus: Mahalia, Ella Mai, Both]
What you did (What you did)
You know I love you but I can't forgive it (I can't forgive)
You could tell me stay, but I have to go (I gotta go)
'Cause I would not expect someone to stay around
If I let them down, oh
What you did (What you did)
Yeah, you know I love you but I can't forgive it (You know I love you, boy)
You could tell me stay, but I have to go (Stay)
'Cause I would not expect someone to stay around
If I let them down, oh
[Bridge: Mahalia]
Oh, you've become the reason I'm so down (Down, down)
Oh, I won't excuse you, I don't wanna go down, yeah (Down, down)
Do you know that you've been the reason I'm so low? (So low)
So you told me to stay here, but you know that I won't
'Cause I still can't believe
[Chorus: Mahalia, Ella Mai]
What you did, no
You know I love you but I can't forgive it
You could tell me stay, but I have to go
'Cause I would not expect someone to stay around
If I let them down, oh
What you did (What you do, what you do)
Yeah, you know I love you but I can't forgive it (Can't forgive, can't, can't forgive)
You could tell me stay, but I have to go (Have to go)
'Cause I would not expect someone to stay around
If I let them down, oh
[Outro: Mahalia]
Wow (Don't apologize, please)
I would never, I would never do it, baby (After all, you've had your fun; oh boy)
(Don't try change my mind, please)
Don't try change my mind
(Baby, me and you are done)
Me and you are done
(Boy, oh boy)
(Boy, oh boy)
