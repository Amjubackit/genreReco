[Verse 1: Marie]
Baby, since you left me
I've been alone
And blue
'Cause you catch me
When I fall
It's all over
My heart is sober
Now you're gone
[Chorus: Marie]
Ooh, what can I do
Ooh, I'm falling without you
[Verse 2: Marie]
You always saved me when I fell
Now my parachute has no sail
It's been a long time that
I have been falling down
It won't be long until
I hit the ground
[Chorus: Marie]
Ooh, what can I do
Ooh, I'm falling without you
Ooh, what can I do
Ooh, I'm falling without you
