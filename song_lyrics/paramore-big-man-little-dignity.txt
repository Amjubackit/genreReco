[Verse 1]
Don't mean to stare at you from across the room
It's like I'm glued to the sheer sight of you
And you're so smooth, it's pitiful
Know you could get away with anything, so that's exactly what you do
[Chorus]
Big man, ooh
Little dignity
Big man, ooh
Little dignity
No offense, but you
You got no integrity
Big man, ooh
Ooh-la-la-la, little dignity
[Verse 2]
Well, well, well, look at you, don't you clean up nice?
Bet it feels good to leave the past behind
Your subscription to redemption has been renewed
You keep your head high, smooth operator in a shit-stained suit
[Chorus]
Big man, ooh
Little dignity
Big man, ooh
Little dignity
No offense, but you
You got no integrity
Big man, ooh
Ooh-la-la-la, little dignity[Post-Chorus]
Oh, I can't look away
[Bridge]
I memorized all your lines
I can't look away, you're like a movie that I love to hate
I fantasize your demise
I should look away because I know you're never gonna change
I keep thinkin' this time, the end'll be different
But it isn't
I keep thinkin' (Keep thinkin') the end is gonna be different
But you keep on winning
[Chorus]
Big man, ooh
Little dignity
Big man, ooh
Little dignity
No offense, but you
You got no integrity
Big man, ooh
Ooh-la-la-la, little dignity
[Outro]
(Ah)
(Ah)
(Ah)
(Ah)
