[Intro]
Sexy woman!
[Chorus]
Woman!
Take me in your arms
Rock your baby
Woman!
Take me in your arms
Rock your baby
[Verse 1]
There's nothin' to it
Just say you wanna do it
Open up your heart
And let the lovin' start
[Chorus]
Woman!
Take me in your arms
Rock your baby
Woman!
Take me in your arms
Rock your baby
[Verse 2]
Yeah! Hold me tight
With all your might
Now, let your lovin' flow
Real sweet and slow
