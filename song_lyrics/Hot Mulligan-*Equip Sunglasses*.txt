[Verse 1]
Head on a pike
Plain and vacant tonight as you cry through your phone
Let the masses support all the hate that you spit
Keep a mouth full of shit
See your smile out at town and our shirt that you sport
Woe is me
Eavesdrop in class, keep your ear to the glass
Woe's me
[Chorus]
It's good to hate, isn't it?
Popping veins, dissonance
Draw and quarter a stranger
To feel some blood on your fingers
You take away, robbery
Follow trends as a hobby
Find flaws in everything else
Because you don't like yourself
Woe is me
[Verse 2]
Prisoner compliance, you'll tend to your bias
Be sure you're identical to all your peers
(Keep your head low) Suggestive
(Horror show) Like clockwork
Predictable, simple, then turn off a gear
