[Verse 1]
You see the face on the TV screen
Coming at you every Sunday?
You see the face on the billboard?
That man is me
On the cover of a magazine
There's no question why I'm smiling
Buy a piece of paradise
And you buy a piece of me
[Pre-Chorus]
I'll get you everything you wanted
I'll get you everything you need
You don't need to believe in hereafter
Just believe in me
[Chorus]
'Cause Jesus, he knows me
And hе knows I'm right
I've been talking to Jesus
All my life
Oh yеs, he knows me
And he knows I'm right
And he's been telling me
Everything is alright[Verse 2]
I believe in the family
With my ever-loving wife beside me
She doesn't know about my girlfriend
Or the man I met last night
Do you believe in God?
'Cause that is what I'm selling
And if you wanna go to heaven
Well, I'll see you right
[Pre-Chorus]
You don't even have to leave your house
Or get out of your chair
You don't even have to touch that dial
'Cause I'm everywhere
[Chorus]
'Cause Jesus, he knows me
And he knows I'm right
I've been talking to Jesus
All my life
Oh yes, he knows me
And he knows I'm right
And he's been telling me
Everything is alright[Bridge]
Won't find me practicing what I'm preaching
Won't find me making no sacrifice
But I can get you a pocketful of miracles
If you promise to be good, try to be nice
God will take good care of you
Just do as I say, not as I do
[Verse 3]
I'm counting my blessings
And I've found true happiness
'Cause I'm getting richer
Day by day
You can find me in the phone book
Just call my toll-free number
You can do it any way you want
Just do it right away
[Pre-Chorus]
Will there be no doubt in your mind?
You'll believe everything I'm saying
If you wanna get closer to Him
Get on your knees and start praying
[Chorus]
'Cause Jesus, he knows me
And he knows I'm right
I've been talking to Jesus
All my life
Oh yes, he knows me
And he knows I'm right
And he's been telling me
Everything is alright[Outro]
'Cause Jesus, he knows me
Jesus, he knows me
Jesus, he knows me
Jesus, he knows me
Jesus, he knows me
Jesus, he knows me
Jesus, he knows me
