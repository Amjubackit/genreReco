[Verse 1]
Girl, I hope your daddy doesn't own a gun, if he does, then I'm done from the things that you're doing to me
You run the coop and you rule the roost with a shake to your sugar they don't serve at Dairy Queen
You wrote the book and you set the hook and you 'bout to light the fuse and that's
[Chorus]
Me on you
Like white on rice in your mama's jambalaya you ain't had in while
Me on you
Like black on night by the mighty Mississippi, she's a-running for miles
Well, I know you know you gone and took control of me and there's nothing that I can do
'Til the break of dawn or the cows come home, I'll be right where you want me to be and that's me on you
[Verse 2]
Good God almighty and Lordy have mercy, little mama got me fumblin', stumblin' by the way that she walks
I need your kiss like a catfish need a stank bait, can't take the way you done and dropped my jaw
You cross the line, you take your time and you know I'm 'bout to be about it
[Chorus]
Me on you
Like white on rice in your mama's jambalaya you ain't had in while
Me on you
Like black on night by the mighty Mississippi, she's a-running for miles
Well, I know you know you gone and took control of me and there's nothing that I can do
'Til the break of dawn or the cows come home, I'll be right where you want me to be and that's me on you[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Me on you
Like white on rice in your mama's jambalaya you ain't had in while
Me on you
Like black on night by the mighty Mississippi, she's a-running for miles
Me on you
Like white on rice in your mama's jambalaya you ain't had in while
Me on you
Like black on night by the mighty Mississippi, she's a-running for miles
Well, I know you know you gone and took control of me and there's nothing that I can do
'Til the break of dawn or the cows come home, I'll be right where you want me to be and that's me on you
Oh, and that's me on you
