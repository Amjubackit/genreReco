[Verse 1]
I've sipped the finest brandy
Smelled the sweetest perfume
I kissed the softest lips
But even they wouldn't do
I drove the Autobahn
In a Coupe de Ville
Climbed Kilimanjaro
It was just a hill
[Chorus]
Now it's gonna take more, more, more
To satisfy me
Satisfy me
[Verse 2]
Now, listen here baby
You're just as fine as they come
But you're a selfish little lover
Hot and cold hit and run
Oh got PhD in TLC
And there's so many fish in the sea
[Chorus]
And it's gonna take more, more, more
To satisfy me
Oh, to satisfy me
Satisfy me[Outro]
It's gonna take more, more, more
Gonna take more, more, more
It's gonna take more
Goin' take more
Goin' take more
To satisfy me
Oh, to satisfy me
Satisfy me
Oh, to satisfy me
Oh, satisfy
