[Intro]
Say hey!
Cha!
[Verse 1]
Hear the sound of the fallin' rain
Comin' down like an Armageddon flame (Hey!)
The shame, the ones who died without a name
Hear the dogs howlin' out of key
To a hymn called "Faith and Misery" (Hey!)
And bleed, the company lost the war today
[Chorus]
I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
On holiday!
[Verse 2]
Hear the drum poundin' out of time
Another protester has crossed the line (Hey!)
To find the money's on the other side
Can I get another Amen? (Amen!)
There's a flag wrapped around a score of men (Hey!)
A gag, a plastic bag on a monument
[Chorus]
I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
On holiday! (Hey!)
