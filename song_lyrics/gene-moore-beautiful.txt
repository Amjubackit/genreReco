Gene Moore:
Every day I wake up with you on my mind (yeah, yeah)
When it comes to love you gettin' all of mine (yeah, yeah)
Imma never tell you no, it's yes all the time (time)
Every single thing I need, you multiply
The greatest story ever told
If I had to describe you in just one statement
Being with you is never cold
You're like spring on a Saturday
Reasons you give me several
To stay loyal to you and never stray
There ain't no comparison
Your love is heaven sent
Chorus:
Every day with you is so beautiful
What you do to me is unusual
Better than any
Better than any
Better than any
Thing I ever had
Every day with you is so beautiful
What you do to me is unusual
Better than any
Better than any
Better than anybody, so beautifulIndia.Arie:
Yes I was made for you
Can't get away from you
Walking and talking with you be (so good)
Everywhere claiming you
It's not a game with you
Nothing and no one can tell me (about you)
No such thing would be necessary
I'll do anything for you, oh
There ain't no comparison
Your love is heaven sent
And that's why
Chorus:
Every day with you is so beautiful
What you do to me is unusual
Better than any
Better than any
Better than any
Thing I ever had
Every day with you is so beautiful
What you do to me is unusual
Better than any
Better than any
Better than anybody, so beautifulIndia.Arie:
It's so hard to imagine my life
Without you
You mean more than this whole world to me (more than this whole world to me)
Gene Moore:
Even if I was a billionaire
Without you it would be minimum wage
The love you give sends me to outer space
And that's why
