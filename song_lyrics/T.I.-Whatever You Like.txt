[Intro]
Aye, Jim, you know the ol' sugar daddies?
They be trickin', they tell them girls
I said you could have whatever you like (If you like)
I said you could have whatever you like (If you like)
Yeah (Yeah)
[Chorus]
Stacks on deck, Patron on ice
And we can pop bottles all night
And, baby, you could have whatever you like (If you like)
I said you could have whatever you like, yeah
Late night sex, so wet and so tight
I gas up the jet for you tonight
And, baby, you could go wherever you like
 (If you like)
I said you could go wherever you like, yeah (Yeah)
[Verse 1]
Anytime you want to pick up the telephone, you
Know it ain't nothin' to drop a couple stacks on you
Want it, you could get it, my dear
Five million dollar home, drop Bentleys, I swear, yeah
[Pre-Chorus]
I want yo' body, need yo' body
Long as you got me you won't need nobody
You want it, I got it, go get it, I'll buy it
Tell them other broke nigga be quiet
