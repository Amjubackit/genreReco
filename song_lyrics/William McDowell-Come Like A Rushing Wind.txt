[Chorus]
Come Like A Rushing Wind
Come Like Never Before
Come Like A Rushing Wind
Come Like Never Before
[Chorus]
Come Like A Rushing Wind (Come Like Never Before)
Come Like Never Before (Come Like A Rushing...)
Come Like A Rushing Wind (Come Like Never Before)
Come Like Never Before (Come Like A Rushing...)
Come Like A Rushing Wind (Come Like Never Before)
Come Like Never Before (Come Like A Rushing...)
Come Like A Rushing Wind
Come Like Never Before
[Chorus]
Don't Wanna Move
I Will Stay Here
Until You Change Me
Cause I Need You
I Don't Wanna Move
I Will Stay Here
Until You Change Me
Cause I Need You
