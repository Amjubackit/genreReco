[Verse 1]
So this is what you meant
When you said that you were spent
And now it's time to build from the bottom of the pit
Right to the top
Don't hold back
Packing my bags and giving the academy a rain check
[Pre-Chorus]
I don't ever wanna let you down
I don't ever wanna leave this town
'Cause after all
This city never sleeps at night
[Chorus]
It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then, I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand?
That I'm never changing who I am
[Verse 2]
So this is where you fell
And I am left to sell
The path to heaven runs through miles of clouded hell
Right to the top
Don't look back
Turn in the rags and giving the commodities a rain check
