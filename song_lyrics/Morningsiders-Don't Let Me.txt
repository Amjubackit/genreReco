[Verse]
Oh brother, where are you?
I think I need a hand
Can you come pick me up?
Don't know where I am
Bet I can tell it's not
Where I want to be
Oh brother, help me out
Keep your eye on me
[Chorus]
Don't let me go somewhere
I can't find my way back home
Don't let me go
Don't let me go somewhere
I can't find my way back home
Don't let me go
Don't let me go somewhere
I can't find my way back home
Don't let me go
Don't let me, don't let me
Don't let me, don't let me go
