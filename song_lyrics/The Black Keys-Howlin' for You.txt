[Intro]
Alright
Yeah
Well now
[Verse 1]
I must admit, I can't explain
Any of these thoughts racin' through my brain, it's true
A-baby, I'm howlin' for you
[Verse 2]
Alright
There's something wrong with this plot
The actors here have not got a clue
Baby, I'm howlin' for you
[Chorus]
Da-da da-da da, da-da da-da da
Da-da da-da da, da-da da-da da
Da-da da-da da, da-da da-da da
Da-da da-da da, da-da da-da da
[Verse 3]
Mockingbird, can't you see
Little girl's got a hold on me, like glue
Baby, I'm howlin' for you
