[Verse 1]
Baby, last night was hands down
One of the best nights, mm
That I've had, no doubt
Between the bottle of wine and the look in your eyes and the Marvin Gaye
Then we danced in the dark under September stars in the pourin' rain
[Pre-Chorus]
And I know that I can't ever tell you enough
That all I need in this life is your crazy love
[Chorus 1]
If I never get to see the Northern Lights
Or if I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night
Oh, if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby, I could die a happy man
A happy man, baby, mmm
[Verse 2]
Baby, that red dress brings me to my knees
Oh, but that black dress makes it hard to breathe
You're a saint, youâ€™re a goddess, the cutest, the hottest
A masterpiece
It's too good to be true, nothing better than you in my wildest dreams
[Pre-Chorus]
And I know that I can't ever tell you enough
That all I need in this life is your crazy love
