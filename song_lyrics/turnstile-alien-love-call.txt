[Chorus: Brendan Yates]
Can't be the only one
Can't be the only one
Can't be the only one
[Verse 1: Brendan Yates]
All my glow is on
Can the will be strong?
Can't be the only one
[Chorus: Brendan Yates, & 
Devonté Hynes
]
Can't be the only one (
Ah
)
Can't be the only one (
Ah
)
Can't be the only one (
Ah
)
[Verse 2: Devonté Hynes]
All my glow is on
Can my will be strong? Ah
Oh (Ah)
[Chorus: Brendan Yates & Devonté Hynes]
Can't be the only one
Can't be the only one
Can't be the only one
[Outro: Devonté Hynes]
Light inside of me (Yeah)
Hard enough to see
What else could it mean? (
Ay, ay, ay, ay
)
Love is in the heart
It came like a dream
Loners out to roam
Sewn at the seam
Light inside of me
Hard enough to be
Locked inside my heart
Floating in the dark
