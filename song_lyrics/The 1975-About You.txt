[Verse 1: Matty Healy]
I know a place
It's somewhere I go when I need to remember your face
We get married in our heads
Something to do while we try to recall how we met
[Chorus: Matty Healy]
Do you think I have forgotten?
Do you think I have forgotten?
Do you think I have forgotten
About you?
[Verse 2: Matty Healy, 
Carly Holt
]
You and I (
Don't let go
)
We're alive (
Don't let go
)
With nothing to do, I could lay and just look in your eyes
Wait (
Don't let go
)
And pretend (
Don't let go, oh
)
Hold on and hope that we'll find our way back in the end (
In the end
)
[Chorus: Matty Healy]
Do you think I havе forgotten?
Do you think I have forgotten?
Do you think I havе forgotten
About you?
Do you think I have forgotten?
Do you think I have forgotten?
Do you think I have forgotten
About you?
