[Verse 1]
Oh, girl
I'd be in trouble if you left me now
'Cause I don't know where to look for love
I just don't know how
[Verse 2]
Oh, girl
How I depend on you
To give me love when I need it
Right on time you would always be
[Bridge]
All my friends call me a fool
They say let the woman take care of you
So I try to be hip and think like the crowd
But even the crowd can't help me now, oh
[Verse 3]
Oh, girl
Tell me, what am I gonna do
I know I've got a guilty face
Girl, I feel so out of place, oh, yeah yeah
[Interlude]
(Du-du, du-du, du-du)
Don't know where to go, who to see, yeah
(Du-du, du-du, du-du)
