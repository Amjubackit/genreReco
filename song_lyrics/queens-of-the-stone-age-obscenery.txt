[Verse 1]
Mannequins have flawless skin
You can dress 'em up like me if you like
But don't lobotomy, I'm happy and free
Listening to crickets in the pale moonlight
I don't give up, I give in, there ain't nothing to win
I'm makin' music for all stereotypes
Modern love, unsentimental, consequences, schmonsequences
I can hum it if you like
[Chorus 1]
Hurrah
The obscenery's fucking useless
Jihad me in obscenery
Born ruthless
Until your rivers run dry
And you're caught in the middlе what you made
In the division of thighs
From the holе where the empathy used to be
[Post-Chorus 1]
Until your rivers run dry, fuck me stupid
And you're caught in the middle what you made
Kiss it goodbye, fuck me stupid
Empty hole where the empathy used to be
In the obscenery is where you're happy to be[Bridge]
Ain't it a little strange?
We're tired of bein' awake
Do you think we'll break?
Like a slap in the face
Enjoy the obscenery, goodnight
[Verse 2]
Self-help, go on, help yourself
You must be pleased with miseries you designed
Voyeurism-jism may cause blurry visions
Spoiled brat or an inner child
Emotional amputees
With phantom pains from missing limbos of life
Oh, the guillotine, 
I'm drownin' in a wet dream
I'll betcha lose your mind
[Chorus 2]
Hurrah, let's do this
Enjoy obscenery, born ruthless
Kiss it goodbye, stupid
We're all caught in the middle and useless
[Post-Chorus 2]
In the obscenery, forget what used to be
'Cause there's no love for anyone who isn't me[Bridge]
Ain't it a little strange?
I'm tired of being awake
Do you think we'll break?
Like a slap in the face
[Outro]
More than a little strange
We really need to wake
Everything gon' break
We're too fucking late
Enjoy the obscenery, goodnight
