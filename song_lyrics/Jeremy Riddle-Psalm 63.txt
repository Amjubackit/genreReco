God You're my God
And earnestly I seek You
My heart and my flesh
They hunger and thirst for You
In this dry and weary land
Iâ€™ve come to worship
I've come to lift up my hands
For I have seen You
I've beheld Your glory
And I am ruined
For there is none to compare
And I long to know You
And the depths of Your love
That always leave me
Time and time again, undone
In You oh Lord
Will I always rejoice
You are the One who upholds me
In You I will place my trust
