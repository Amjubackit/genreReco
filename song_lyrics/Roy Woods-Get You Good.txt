[Verse 1]
I feel like it's been a long while now since you've been gone
Maybe it's 'cause we had sex, that time it was too damn good
Don't let your panties get too wet, let me take it off for ya'
Who else is gonna be a man to ya'?
I know that I'm young, but I'm just bein' honest
You're with me right now, baby let's go further
'Cause I'm gonna get you good
You don't fuck with niggas in your hood
Southside
 nigga and the name is Roy
Ex-girlfriend knows I've been up there
Everybody hear, don't know what it is
I want you to show me yourself
[Pre-Chorus]
Since I'm always here, I'm only gone for a minute (Gone for a minute)
Whenever I push to start you, I don't want you to finish
Just keep ridin'
Since I'm always here, I'm only gone for a minute (Gone for a minute)
Whenever I push to start you, I don't want you to finish
Just keep ridin'
[Chorus]
'Cause I'm gon' get you good
There ain't nothin' wrong with a little play
'Cause I'm gon' get you good
There ain't nothin' wrong with a little play
'Cause I'm gon' get you good
There ain't nothin' wrong with a little play
'Cause I'm gon' get you good
Get you good, get you good, get you good
'Cause I'm gon' get you good
