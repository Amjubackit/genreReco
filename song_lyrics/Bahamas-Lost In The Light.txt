[Verse 1]
I'm lost in the light
I pray for the night
To take me, to take you too
After so many words
Still nothing's heard
Don't know what we should do
[Chorus]
So if someone could see me now
Let them see you
[Verse 2]
'Twas my greatest thrill
When we just stood still
You let me hold your hand 'til I had my fill
Even counting sheep
Don't help me sleep
I just toss and turn right there beside ya
[Chorus]
So if someone could help me now
They'd help you too
[Post-Chorus]
They'd help you too
See you through
All the hard things we've all gotta do
'Cause this life is long
So you wouldn't be wrong
Being free, leaving me on my own
