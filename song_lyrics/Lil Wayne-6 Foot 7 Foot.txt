[Chorus: Harry Belafonte]
Six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch
Six-six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch
[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Ahem
Excuse my charisma, vodka with a spritzer
Swagger down pat; call my shit Patricia
Young Money militia
, 
and I am the commissioner
You no wan' start Weezy 'cause the 'F' is for finisher
So misunderstood, but what's a world without enigma?
Two bitches at the same time; synchronized swimmers
Got the girl twisted 'cause she open when you twist her
Never met the bitch, but I fuck her like I missed her
Life is the bitch, and death is her sister
Sleep is the cousinâ€”what a fuckin' family picture
You know Father Time, and we all know Mother Nature
It's all in the family, but I am of no relation
No matter who's buyin', I'm a celebration
Black and white diamonds; fuck segregation
Fuck that shit, my money up, you niggas just Honey Nut
Young Money runnin' shit, and you niggas just runner-ups
I don't feel I done enough, so I'ma keep on doin' this shit
Lil Tunechi or Young Tuna Fish, ha!
[Chorus: Harry Belafonte,
