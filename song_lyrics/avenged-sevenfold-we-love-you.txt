[Intro]
There you are, youâ€™ve come so far
Sunny days, the air tastes so sweet, flowers greet
Birds will sing you mean everything, you can be anything
[Refrain]
More power, more pace
More money, more taste
More sex, more pills
More skin, more shills
Build tall, build higher
Build far, build wider
Build here, build down
Build up, build now
[Chorus]
Look at the way you go
You're one in a million and you know it shows
And we love you
Unto the mud
[Refrain]
More wants,
 more needs
More hits,
 
morphine
More speed,
 more drive
More self,
 
more time
Build out, build fast
Build strong, build vast
Build too, build more
Build all, build war[Chorus]
Look at the way you go
You're one in a million and you know it shows
And we love you
Do unto the mud
Mud
[Verse 1]
Race to scale the body stack
Lay foot to face atop broken back
A failure here is a failure earned
So do unto the top
Do unto the end
Do unto the mud
Do
[Refrain]
More power, more pace
More money, 
more taste
More sex, more pills
More skin, more shills
More wants, more needs
More hits, morphine
More speed, more drive
More self, more time
Build tall, build higher
Build far, build wider
Build here, build down
Build up, build now
Build out, build fast
Build strong, build vast
Build, build, build, build
Build, build, build, build[Verse 2]
Look at the way you go
You're one in a million
And you know it shows
And we love you
Look at the way that you choose
You know you'll never lose
And all that you are
It was all you deserved anyway
Sunny days
[Outro]
And we love you
And we love you
And we love you
