[Verse 1]
It's looking like a limb torn off
Or all together just taken apart
We're reeling through an endless fall
We are the ever-living ghost of what once was
[Chorus]
But no one is ever gonna love you more than I do
No one's gonna love you more than I do
[Verse 2]
And anything to make you smile
It is a better side of you to admire
But they should never take so long
Just to be over then back to another one
[Chorus]
And no one is ever gonna love you more than I do
No one's gonna love you more than I do
[Bridge]
But someone, they could have warned you
When things start splitting at the seams and now
The whole thing's tumbling down
Things start splitting at the seams and now
If things start splitting at the seams and now
It's tumbling down hard
[Verse 3]
Anything to make you smile
You are the ever-living ghost of what once was
I never want to hear you say
That you'd be better off or you liked it that way
[Chorus]
And no one is ever gonna love you more than I do
No one's gonna love you more than I do
[Bridge]
But someone, they should have warned you
When things start splitting at the seams and now
The whole thing's tumbling down
Things start splitting at the seams and now
If things start splitting at the seams and now
It's tumbling down, hard
