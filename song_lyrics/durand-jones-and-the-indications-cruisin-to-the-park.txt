[Chorus]
Let's go cruisin’ to the park
Cruisin' after dark, let's go out
Slow it down to five
On an endless drive, let’s go out
[Verse 1]
Baby, let's cruise together
With you next to me
Maybe we will cruise forever
In pure ecstasy
[Pre-Chorus]
Someday, we'll go to streets we don't know
For now, we'll just glide, enjoy the ride
[Chorus]
So, let's go cruisin' to the park
Cruisin' after dark, let’s go out, baby
Slow it down to five
On an endless drive, let’s go out
[Verse 2]
Slow it down: where's the hurry?
We’ll float through these streets
Bring the sun, leave the worry
Sail upon the breeze[Pre-Chorus]
Someday, we'll go to streets we don't know
But for now, we'll just glide, enjoy the ride
[Chorus]
So, let’s go cruisin' to the park (Yeah)
Cruisin' after dark, let's go out, oh baby
Slow it down to five (Ohh)
On an endless drive, let's go out
