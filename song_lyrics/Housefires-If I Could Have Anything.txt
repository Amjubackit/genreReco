[Verse 1: Ahjah Walls]
May I be like Mary
Open to the movements of Your heart
Blessed in the keeping of Your promise
A faithful friend of God
May I love your presence, Jesus
More than any gift You've given me
More than any crown I could receive
More than all my dreams
[Chorus: Ahjah Walls]
If I could have anything
Let it be Your eyes on me
Every time I catch Your gaze
My world starts changing
I don't have that much to bring
Just a simple song to sing
If I could have anything
Let me be an offering
If I could have anything
Let it be Your eyes on me
Every time I catch Your gaze
My world starts changing
I don't have that much to bring
Just a simple song to sing
If I could have anything
Let me be an offering
