[Verse 1]
Eight years old, a couple cane poles
Sittin' down by the creek
Our lines in the water, watching those bobbers
Seein' that red sun sink
Mama's on the porch yelling "Supper's hot
Y'all come and get it!"
We yelled five more minutes
[Verse 2]
At sixteen it was twelve o three
Standin' at her front door
Katie's dad said midnight
But we needed just a little more
Yellow light flipping on and off
Interruptin' that goodnight kissing
We wanted five more minutes
[Chorus]
Time rolls by, the clock don't stop
I wish I had a few more drops
Of the good stuff, the good times
Oh, but they just keep on flying
Right on by like it ain't nothing
Wish I had me a pause button
Moments like those, Lord knows I'd hit it
And give myself five more minutes
