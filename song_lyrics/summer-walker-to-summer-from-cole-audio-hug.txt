[Verse: J. Cole]
Hey, Ms. Walker
Thank you for wantin' a verse from me
Apologies for the wait, some times it's hard to-
Get the distraction up off ya'
For enough time to jot your thoughts
But fuck it, this mornin' I gots to
I'm thinkin' about ya
I heard you just had you another lil' baby, congratulations
I hope you got through it with no complications
I find it amazing the way that you juggle your kids, the biz, the fame
The bitches that's hatin', they sit around waitin' for you to fall off, like the album I'm makin'
But I hope that you takin' a little time for yourself
Stealin' a moment or two to unwind
Between the hectic sounds of your precious baby cryin'
Do you clear your mind? Must be a lot goin' on
I hear it in all of your songs
Niggas been doin' you wrong
Family been doin' you wrong
On days you feelin' like you on your own
I wrote this for you to put on
Thank you for sharin' your light, your voice and writin' them beautiful poems
Session 32
 bring me to tears
, be gettin' choked up when I hear it
Seem like I keep cryin' off so much since a nigga had these kids
And I don't know what it is that made me so sensitive
More than I already was
But never mind that, I'm back, I'm sendin' you this little audio hug
In hopes that you smile, forgettin' the stress that piles from all the above
The more that we hurt, the harder we love
As soon as it's gone we gotta re-up, it's just like a drug
If people knew half of the pressure they'd know that it's hard to be her
I'm sendin' you, SZA & Ari my love
Y'all holdin' us down, y'all holdin' the crowns
You ever need somethin' from me, don't hesitate, please
Just hit me and I'll be around, I'm gone[Chorus: Summer Walker]
Call me when you need some
Call me when you need some
Call me when you need some love
Call me when you need some
Call me when you need some
Call me when you need some love
Call me when you need some
Call me when you need some
Call me when you need some love
Call me when you need some love
Call me when you need some love
