[Intro]
Obviously, we're at the beginning of something
I don't expect you to know where it's gonna go
But I believe we might be onto something
And I just thought maybe you should know
[Chorus]
I've been playing out a lot of hypotheticals in my mind
I've been writing your name down next to mine
Been imagining all the things you and I could do
I've seen all the possibilities in my dreams
You're alone when you should really be next to me
Baby, let's not wait and see
[Verse 1]
Immediate action is unnecessary
It's a fatal attraction, it's a little scary
But I got a plan of attack
And I'll get us therе someday soon, I know it
I got a plan A and I got a plan B
And if it's absolutely necеssary, we'll go to plan C
Whatever I gotta do to be with you
[Chorus]
I've been playing out a lot of hypotheticals in my mind
I've been writing your name down next to mine
Been imagining all the things you and I could do
I've seen all the possibilities in my dreams
You're alone when you should really be next to me
Baby, let's not wait and see
