[Intro]
Where we goin'?
Detroit
Trying get that mula
Yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
Wha-ah-wha-why-why
Yeah
[Verse 1]
I'm in Detroit with Khadijah
Fighting feelings, rollin' weed, yeah
It's organic how we speed through
Midnight moments, foreign vehicles
[Pre-Chorus]
Fifteen minutes of fame or
Fifteen minutes away from
Findin' love in a waveform
Is you someone to wait for?
[Chorus]
Is you tryna stay on the ride?
Or is you tryna, is you tryna leave the vibe?
Take you to the hotel if you wanna slide
Renaissance drivе, baby, make a right
Is you tryna fall for the night?
Or is you tryna, is tryna fall for life?
City full of pеople, you got options, right?
Baskin' robins, baby, what you wanna try?
[Post-Chorus]
What's your flavour?
Tell me, what's your flavour?
What's your flavour?
Tell me, what's your flavour?
It's a wang dang thang
Westside, seven mile slang
Coney Island Hangs
Tell me, what's your flavour?
[Verse 2]
I think she want me for my loot (Ooh, ooh)
I think she wanna get some food (Yeah)
So thick that body make a man commute (Yeah)
Uh, I think she want her
[Pre-Chorus]
Fifteen minutes of fame or
Fifteen minutes away from
Findin' love in a waveform
Is you someone to wait for?
[Chorus]
Is you tryna stay on the ride?
Or is you tryna, is you tryna leave the vibe?
Take you to the hotel if you wanna slide
Renaissance drive, baby, make a right
Is you tryna fall for the night?
Or is you tryna, is tryna fall for life?
City full of people, you got options, right?
Baskin' robins, baby, what you wanna try?
[Post-Chorus]
What's your flavour?
Tell me, what's your flavour?
What's your flavour?
Tell me, what's your flavour?
It's a wang dang thang
Westside, seven mile slang
Coney Island Hangs
Tell me, what's your flavour?
[Outro]
Is you tryna stay on the ride?
Leave the vibe
If you wanna slide
Baby, make a right
Leave the vibe
Wanna slide, make a right
