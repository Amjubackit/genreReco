[Intro]
Where we goin'?
Detroit
Trying get that mula
Yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
Wha-ah-wha-why-why
Yeah
[Verse 1]
I'm in Detroit with Khadijah
Fighting feelings, rollin' weed, yeah
It's organic how we speed through
Midnight moments, foreign vehicles
[Pre-Chorus]
Fifteen minutes of fame or
Fifteen minutes away from
Findin' love in a waveform
Is you someone to wait for?
[Chorus]
Is you tryna stay on the ride?
Or is you tryna, is you tryna leave the vibe?
Take you to the hotel if you wanna slide
Renaissance drivе, baby, make a right
Is you tryna fall for the night?
Or is you tryna, is tryna fall for life?
City full of pеople, you got options, right?
Baskin' robins, baby, what you wanna try?
