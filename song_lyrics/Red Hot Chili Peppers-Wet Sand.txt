[Verse 1: Anthony Kiedis]
My shadow side so amplified keeps coming back dissatisfied
Elementary son, but it's so—
My love affair with everywhere was innocent, why do you care?
Someone start the car, time to go
You're the best I know
[Verse 2: Anthony Kiedis]
My sunny side has up and died, I'm betting that when we collide
The universe will shift into a low
The travesties that we have seen are treating me like Benzedrine
Automatic laughter from a pro
[Refrain: Anthony Kiedis]
My, what a good day for a... a walk outside
I'd like to get to know you a little better, baby
God knows that I really tried
My, what a good day for a... a take out bride
I'd like to say we did it for the better of–
[Verse 3: Anthony Kiedis]
I saw you there so unaware, those hummingbirds all in your hair
Elementary son, but it's so—
The disrepair of Norma Jean could not compare to your routine
Balarama beauty goin' toe to toe
