[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus (Tom DeLonge)]
Never found out why you left him, but this answer begs a question
Too blind to see tomorrow, too broke to beg or borrow
Young and stupid (left wide open)
Hearts are wasted (lives are broken)
[Verse 2: Mark Hoppus (Tom DeLonge)]
One more point of contention, I need some intervention
Approached with vague intentions, betray my 
short attention
Span
 the distance (bridge the border)
Beg forgiveness ('round the corner)
[Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
Every time I look for you, the sun goes down
And I stumble when this whole thing runs aground
I left another message, you are never around
But every time I look for you, the sun goes down once more
[Post-Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
Will the last one out, please shut the door
[Verse 3: Mark Hoppus (Tom DeLonge)]
More time apart will give you a few more months to argue
Is this too much to live through, it always seems too far to
Drive the point home
 (send more letters)
Pray tomorrow (ends up better)
