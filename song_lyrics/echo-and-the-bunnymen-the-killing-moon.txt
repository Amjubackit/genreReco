[Verse 1]
Under blue moon I saw you
So soon you'll take me
Up in your arms too late to beg you
Or cancel it, though I know it must be
The killing time
Unwillingly mine
[Chorus]
Fate
Up against your will
Through the thick and thin
He will wait until
You give yourself to him
[Verse 2]
In starlit nights I saw you
So cruelly you kissed me
Your lips a magic world
Your sky all hung with jewels
The killing moon
Will come too soon
[Chorus]
Fate
Up against your will
Through the thick and thin
He will wait until
You give yourself to him[Solo]
[Verse 1]
Under blue moon I saw you
So soon you'll take me
Up in your arms, too late to beg you
Or cancel it, though I know it must be
The killing time
Unwillingly mine
[Chorus]
Fate
Up against your will
Through the thick and thin
He will wait until
You give yourself to him
Fate
Up against your will
Through the thick and thin
He will wait until
You give yourself to him
Fate
Up against your will
Through the thick and thin
He will wait until
You give yourself to him
You give yourself to him
Fate
Up against your will
Through the thick and thin
He will wait until
You give yourself to him
You give yourself to him
