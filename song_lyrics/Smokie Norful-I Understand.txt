Ohhhhh..
Sometimes I feel like giving up
It seems like my best just ain't good enough
Lord if you hear me, I'm calling you
Do you see, do you care all about what I'm going through
And then He says, one more day hmm, one more step
See I'm preparing you for myself
And when you can't hear my voice, please trust my plan
I'm the Lord, I see and yes I understand
But sometimes I feel like I'm all alone
I'm just like a stranger so far from home
I feel like I've done all that I can do
Please Lord give me strength, I'm just trying to make it through
That's when he told me ohhh (one more day), one more step, yeah (one more step)
Oh my child (I'm preparing you) I'm preparing you for myself
And when you can't hear my voice (can't hear my voice), please just trust my plan
I'm the Lord I see you and yes I understand
Ohhh He knows (how much we can bear) just how much we can bear ohhh
And in the time of trouble he promised he would always be there
I understand (I understand)
The Lord is telling you yes I understand(I understand)
I am the Lord I see you and yes I understand
