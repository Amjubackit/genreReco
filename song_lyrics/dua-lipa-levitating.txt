[Intro: DaBaby]
Billboard Baby, Dua Lipa make 'em dance when it come on
Everybody lookin' for a dancefloor to run on
[Verse 1: Dua Lipa]
If you wanna run away with me, I know a galaxy
And I can take you for a ride
I had a premonition that we fell into a rhythm
Where the music don't stop for life
Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes
Shining just the way I like
If you're feeling like you need a little bit of company
You met me at the perfect time
[Pre-Chorus: Dua Lipa]
You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way, we're renegading
Yeah, yeah, yеah, yeah, yeah
[Chorus: Dua Lipa]
I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight
I need you all night, comе on, dance with me
I'm levitating
You, moonlight, you're my starlight (
You're the moonlight
)
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating
