[Intro]
When it's hot
(When it's hot)
[Verse 1]
When it's hot and stormy tonight
We can feel it's magical light
As the sea comes speaking to me
Time will voice its drift out of key
[Chorus]
When dancing is seeking delight
When dancing is seeking delight
When dancing is seeking delight
When dancing is seeking delight
[Verse 2]
When I see this all to my brain
Tell the Lord we've trouble where we went
Like a wave come over my head
Don't know how your eyes on the rain
[Chorus]
When dancing is seeking delight
When dancing is seeking delight
When dancing is seeking delight
When dancing is seeking delight[Bridge]
[Chorus]
When dancing is seeking delight
When dancing is seeking delight
When dancing is seeking delight
When dancing is seeking delight
