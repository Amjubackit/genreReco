[Intro: Snoh Aalegra]
Ooh-ooh, ah
Oh woah
Hm-mm
[Verse 1: Snoh Aalegra]
Tell me, how
Are we supposed to still be talkin' every day
When everything between us just completely changed?
Oh, why?
Tell me, how
Am I supposed to go ahead and just erase
Every feeling, every memory we share?
Oh, why?
[Chorus: Snoh Aalegra & 
Ari PenSmith & P2J

'Cause I was dying for this love, this love (
This love, this love
)
Yeah, I was dying for your love, your love
So tell me, baby, do you want me like I want you?
Even if you did, you wouldn't say, I know you
Some nights I even think about if I should call you
'Cause I thought you were the one
'Cause I was dying for this love, this love (
This love, this love
)
Yeah, I was dying for your love, your love
So tell me, baby, do you want me like I want you?
Even if you did, you wouldn't say, I know you
Some nights I even think about if I should call you
'Cause I thought you were the one
