[Verse]
Yeah, I got voices in my head again, tread carefully
And I don't medicate, it helps me temporarily
I got problems, I got issues, yeah, apparently
Trauma that I'm burying, I think I need some therapy
I battle depression, I'm back with a message
I'm asking the question that if you hate me, why you acting obsessive?
I'm past the point of no return, fuck being passive aggressive
I'll brandish a weapon, teach all you motherfuckers a lesson, yeah
I actually battle my demons and shadows
They swim in the deep and they creep in the shallows, I'm lost
I gotta admit that I'm living the life that I've always wanted
But it comes at a cost, they're licking their chops, they're fixing to rip me a part, I'm swimming with sharks
I'm lifting the bar, I'm lifting it into the stars
I'm like a shot of adrenaline, mixed with some Ritalin
You started a battle, but bitch, I'ma finish it
You think you can stop me, not even a little bit
Nowadays everybody's so sensitive
Taking my words and you pick it a part
Tripping on nothing just get in the car
Gripping and ripping I'm sticking the mark
I'm tipping the ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-charts
I got enemies trying to get rid of me
Evil tendencies are fucking with me mentally
I got people that don't like me in the industry
I can feel your energy, you are not a friend to me
'Cause I have been to places that you never wanna go, yeah
I got dirt on people, but they act like I don't know, yeah
I could do some damage, but I'll never rock the boat
All it takes is one post, watch 'em fall like dominoes
You'll never get rid of me, too many mini-me's ripping my imagery
You know my history, it ain't a mystery
I put every enemy outta they misery
Somebody send me some positive energy
About to go Darth, about to go Disney
Into the darkness, into infinity a
nd
Shut you motherfuckers up, you listening?
Stacking every little pretty penny that I'm getting
And I'm never giving in to anybody, always winning
Never kidding
 when I die, I'm taking everybody with me
You're never gonna get me, 'cause you'll never see it simply
I'm a motherfucking god, you're a light yawn
I'm a time bomb and the vibes wrong, is this mic on?
I'm killing the syllables with a loaded refillable
I'm a lyrical typical supervillain, I'm venomous
And I'm never gonna stop until they put me on top of the list
