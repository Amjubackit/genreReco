[Verse 1]
Can I call you Rose? (Can I call you Rose?)
‘Cause you’re sweet like a flower in bloom
(Can I call you Rose?)
Can I call you Rose? (Can I call you Rose?)
‘Cause your fragrance takes over the room… darling
(Can I call you Rose?)
[Chorus]
I wanna plant you in my heart, oh
So love can grow
[Verse 2]
Can I call you Rose? (Can I call you Rose?)
‘Cause your thorns won’t let love in too soon
(Can I call you Rose?)
Can I call you Rose? (Can I call you Rose?)
‘Cause your roots have the power to consume… me
(Can I call you Rose?)
[Chorus]
I wanna plant you in my heart, oh-oh
So love can grow
[Interlude]
I was meditating on love and you and roses
And the universe told me, “Put it in a love song”[Bridge]
(Put it in a love song, put it in a love, put it in a love song)
Oh, Rose
(Put it in a love song, put it in a love, put it in a love song)
Oh, Rose
(Put it in a love song, put it in a love, put it in a love song)
(Put it in a love song, put it in a love, put it in a love song)
Won’t you let me in your heart?
(Put it in a love song, put it in a love, put it in a love song)
Your heart...
(Put it in a love song, put it in a love, put it in a love song)
Oh, your heart
(Put it in a love song, put it in a love, put it in a love song)
(Put it in a love song, put it in a love, put it in a love song)
[Outro]
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh…
