[Verse 1]
Some call it powers of the mind
Bendin' thoughts through space and time
Readin' everyone like that old book you've read a thousand times
Heard 'bout it when I was young
Finishing sentences on tips of tongues
Six senses got you seein' all these things I haven't done
We're not the only ones
[Chorus]
You're laughing like I'm supposed to know
What you're thinkin' but I don't
I know that this never comes easy
Not much that matters that won't
You're laughing like I'm supposed to know
What you're thinkin' but I don't
I know that this never comes easy
But I'll never be your mindreader
[Verse 2]
I could head to old Japan
On a mountain with some ancient man
Searchin' for some wisdom
That I still won't understand
Tell me, what'll it take?
Never even knew you felt that way
Sittin' here farther apart than
Orlando to L.A
Delayed at the gate[Chorus]
You're laughing like I'm supposed to know
What you're thinkin' but I don't
I know that this never comes easy
Not much that matters that won't
You're laughing like I'm supposed to know
What you're thinkin' but I don't
I know that this never comes easy
But I'll never be your mindreader
[Bridge]
Mind, mind, mindreader
Mind, mind, mindreader
(I can't tell you what I don't know)
Mind, mind, mindreader
Mind, mind, mindreader
(I can't tell you what I don't know)
Mind, mind, mindreader
[Chorus]
You're laughing like I'm supposed to know
What you're thinkin' but I don't
I know that this never comes easy
Not much that matters that won't
You're laughing like I'm supposed to know
What you're thinkin' but I don't
I know that this never comes easy
But I'll never be your mindreader[Outro]
I'll never be your mindreader
I'll never be your mindreader
I'll never be your mindreader
I'll never be your mindreader
