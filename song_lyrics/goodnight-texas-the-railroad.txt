Run run run with the railroad
When their backs are turned
Run for the fences Riley
When their backs are turned
Fo-llow the railroad Riley
When their backs are turned
Run for the mountains Riley
When their backs are turned
You'll find 
the place you're promised
When their backs are turned
Run run run with the railroad
When their backs are turned
Run run run with the railroad
When their backs are turned
Run run run with the railroad
Get outta their sight
When the engine turns the you gotta move on
(and u gotta move on at night)
