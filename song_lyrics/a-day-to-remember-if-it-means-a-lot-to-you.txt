[Verse 1: Jeremy McKinnon]
And hey, darling
I hope you're good tonight
And I know you don't feel right when I'm leaving
Yeah, I want it, but no, I don't need it
Tell me something sweet to get me by
'Cause I can't come back home 'til they're singing
[Pre-Chorus: Jeremy McKinnon]
La, la la la, la la la, 'til everyone is singing
[Chorus: Jeremy McKinnon]
If you can wait 'til I get home
Then I swear to you that we can make this last, la, la
If you can wait 'til I get home
Then I swear, come tomorrow, this will all be in our past
[Post-Chorus: Jeremy McKinnon]
Well, it might be for the best
[Verse 2: Sierra Kusterbeck]
And hey, sweetie
Well, I need you here tonight
And I know that you don't want to be leaving me
Yeah, you want it, but I can't help it
I just feel complete when you're by my side
But I know you can't come home 'til they're singing
