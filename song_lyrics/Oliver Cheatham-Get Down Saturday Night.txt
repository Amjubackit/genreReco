[Chorus]
Get down, it's Saturday night
Saturday night
Saturday night
Get down, it's Saturday night
Saturday night
Saturday night
[Verse 1]
Saturday morning
Friday's at an end
Housework is calling me
But where to begin?
Kids are out of school
Trying to find a friend
Everybody's busy
Can't wait for the night to begin
[Pre-Chorus]
You work all week long
You work your fingers to the bone
Friday's at an end
I can't wait for Saturday to begin
[Chorus]
I'm thinking (It's Saturday night)
I'm gonna have myself some fun fun fun (Saturday night)
(It's gonna be alright) (Saturday night)
Make love until the morning come
(Get down, it's Saturday night)
Gonna have myself some fun fun fun fun (It's Saturday night)
(Saturday night) (It's gonna be alright)
(Saturday night) Make love until the morning come
