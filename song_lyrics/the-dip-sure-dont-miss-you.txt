Someday I might miss you
But I sure don't miss you right now
I was blue as a man could be
When you left me
But I sure don't miss you right now
It took me awhile
To get back on my feet
It took me awhile
To smile again
I was ashamed that I could ever be so weak
But I love you girl
Yes I did
Someday I might miss you
But I sure don't miss you right now
I was blue as a man could be
When you left me
But I sure don't miss you right now
When you put me down I was
All torn up
Sure enough
Crying every night
When I was eatin life
And everything feels so new
Finally got over you
Someday I might miss you
But I sure don't miss you right now
I was blue as a man could be
When you left me
But I sure don't miss you right now
Some nights I start to feel real weak
I get so low and down
I can hardly sleep
But I know this too shall pass
And at last
I don't miss you, baby
Someday I might miss you
But I sure don't miss you right now
I was blue as a man could be
When you left me
But I sure don't miss you right now
Someday I might miss you
But I sure don't miss you right now
I was blue as a man could be
When you left me
But I sure don't miss you right now
