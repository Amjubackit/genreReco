[Verse 1]
How long have you been waiting
To take our pictures down?
How long have you been breaking?
Why am I just finding out?
It kills me to know
You were drifting alone
You don't have to stay, no
But can I say before you go?
[Chorus]
I would have searched the whole world over for you
Took a flight, through the night
To be that shoulder for you, and
I would've let go if you wanted me to
How many times did you say you loved me
When it wasn't true?
I'm just wondering
How long has it been over for you?
[Post-Chorus]
How long, how long, how long, how long?
How long?
How long, how long, how long, how long?
How long?
[Verse 2]
What do you tell your parents?
What do you tell yourself?
Was it something I was missing
Or is there someone else?
It kills me to know
This house ain't a home
And you don't wanna stay, no
But can I say before you go?
[Chorus]
I would have searched the whole world over for you
Took a flight, through the night
To be that shoulder for you, and (And I)
I would've let go if you wanted me to
How many times did you say you loved me
When it wasn't true?
I'm just wondering (I'm just wondering)
How long has it been over for you?
[Post-Chorus]
How long, how long, how long, how long?
How long?
How long, how long, how long, how long?
[Bridge]
Maybe some day I'll be okay
But right now, I don't know
You used to tell me everything
And that's what hurts the most
[Pre-Chorus]
It would be easier if I hated you
But I still miss the person
That I thought I knew (And I)
[Chorus]
I would've let go if you wanted me to
How many times did you say you loved me
When it wasn't true?
I'm just wondering (I'm just wondering)
How long has it been over?
I'm still wondering
How long has it been over for you?
