[Verse 1]
You were a lover before time's beginning
You gave Your love freely withholding nothing
Jesus, my Jesus
You carried the weight of the world on Your shoulders
You stopped at nothing, to prove You were for us
Jesus, my Jesus
[Chorus]
It's extravagant, it doesn't make sense
We'll never comprehend, the way You love us
It's unthinkable, only heaven knows
Just how far You'd go, to say You love us
To say You love us
To say You love us
[Verse 2]
You don't belittle our pain and our suffering
And You comfort us in our greatest unraveling
Jesus, my Jesus
And You are the dawn that is breaking within me
And You are the sun that is rising around me
Jesus, my Jesus!
[Chorus]
It's extravagant, it doesn't make sense
We'll never comprehend, the way You love us
It's unthinkable, only heaven knows
Just how far You'd go, to say You love us
To say You love us
To say You love us[Bridge]
Here is all my love
It's Yours, no conditions
When You pull me close
No, I won't resist it
Here is all my love
It's Yours, no conditions
When You pull me close
No, I won't resist it
Here is all my love
It's Yours, no conditions
When You pull me close
No, I won't resist it
No, I won't resist it
No, I won't resist it
No, I won't resist it
[Chorus]
It's extravagant, it doesn't make sense
We'll never comprehend, the way You love us
It's unthinkable, only heaven knows
Just how far You'd go, to say You love us
To say You love us
To say You love us
[Post-Chorus]
To say You love us
To say You love us
To say You love us
To say You love us[Outro]
It's extravagant, it doesn't make sense
We'll never comprehend, the way You love us
It's unthinkable, only heaven knows
Just how far You'd go, to say You love us
