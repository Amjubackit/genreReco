[Verse 1]
One mattress, few boxes
You are moving too soon
Wanna jar up these moments
For the rest of my June
Your place is empty, so there's
More room to dance
I haven't kissed you enough
This is my last chance
[Chorus]
Don't leave so soon
Too close to you
Don't leave so soon
Too close to you
[Verse 2]
You're in love with a singer
So I sing you to bed
Just like a little baby
And I start to pretend
You cannot leave tomorrow
The summer's just begun
You know we have our problems
The distance ruins us
