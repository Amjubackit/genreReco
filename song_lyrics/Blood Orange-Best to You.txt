[Verse 1: Empress Of]
Call it all for nothing
But I'd rather be nothing to you
Than be a part of something
Of something that I didn't do
[Chorus: 
(Dev Hynes)
 + Empress Of]
(Do you really want to?)
I can be the only one
(Did he even notice?)
Who can be the best to you, be the best to you
(Do you really want to?)
I can be the only one
(Did he even notice?)
Who can be the best to you, be the best to you
[Verse 2: Empress Of]
Part of me is faking
Faking it all just for fun
Part of me is breaking
Breaking apart when you come
[Chorus: (Dev Hynes) + Empress Of]
(Do you really want to?)
I can be the only one
(Did he even notice?)
Who can be the best to you, be the best to you (
Oh
)
(Do you really want to?)
I can be the only one
(Did he even notice?)
Who can be the best to you, be the best to you
