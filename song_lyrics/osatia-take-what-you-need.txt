I never had the right words to say
But I think you get me anyway
You caught me at the worst time
Thought you would have left but you’re here to stay
If only I could show you what I see
Maybe that would help set you free
You said I caught you at the worst time
Thought I would have left but I chose to stay
You let me know if I get too close
Just say the word
I'll learn to let you go
Just say the word and I'll let you go
Take what you need
You’ve been so guarded
But I know what you feel
I’ve gotten used to the bitter end
I know that you couldn’t
Give more and you shouldn’t
Take what you need
I’vе gotten used to the bittеr end
You said that every time you look at me
It's hard to see the irony
Disregarding everything that makes you wanna leave
But you wanna stay
You fell asleep on the car ride home
You said you didn’t want to be alone
I can be your escape we can drive all night
Just to get awayYou let me know if I get too close
Just say the word
Say the word and I'll let go
Take what you need
You’ve been so guarded
But I know what you feel
I’ve gotten used to the bitter end
I know that you couldn’t
Give more and you shouldn’t
Take what you need
I’ve gotten used to the bitter end
You don’t know what you’re worth
So you settle for less than you deserve
I just wanted to help you
Don’t worry about me
It makes the pain all worth the while
Every time we touch
Every time you smile
So just say the word and I'll learn to let go
Take what you need
You’ve been so guarded
But I know what you feel
I’ve gotten used to the bitter end
I know that you couldn’t
Give more and you shouldn’t
Take what you need
I’ve gotten used to the bitter endTake what you need
You’ve been so guarded
But I know what you feel
I’ve gotten used to the bitter end
I know that you couldn’t
Give more and you shouldn’t
Take what you need
I’ve gotten used to the bitter end
If only I could show you what I see
Maybe that would help set you free
You said I caught you at the worst time
Thought I would have left but I chose to stay
