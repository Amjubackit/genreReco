[Verse 1]
I dream of a past so I can break through
The walls I have built inside
The thoughts I can grasp, 
transparency through
They constantly fight and collide
[Pre-Chorus]
I'd love to see a different world
A place where you can't find me
[Chorus: Jonathan Davis (Corey Taylor)]
Feel me, kill me
, 
my back's up against the wall
Your magic spell doesn't work anymore
Kill me, kill me, 
that's what you've got to face my friend (My friend!)
This ain't the end (End!)
[Verse 2]
Why can't I relax and let it be true?
This world that I tried to hide
It's kind of a mess, too reckless for you
This place makes me feel alive
[Pre-Chorus]
I'd love to see a different world
A place where you can't find me[Chorus: Jonathan Davis (Corey Taylor)]
Feel me, kill me
, 
my back's up against the wall
Your magic spell doesn't work anymore
Kill me, kill me, 
that's what you've got to face my friend (My friend!)
This ain't the end (End!)
[Bridge: Corey Taylor]
The call for the purposes, the changing behavior
Ends at us all
, we keep constraints on the strangers
It gets on top of you and forces your perspective
Then you know it, you feel it
It's as dark as you can get you want it
Harder, harder, harder, give it to you
Harder, harder, you might just want it
Harder, harder, harder, give it to you
Harder, harder, I don't think you'll ever get it
[Chorus: Jonathan Davis (Corey Taylor)]
Feel me, kill me
, 
my back's up against the wall
Your magic spell doesn't work anymore
Kill me, kill me, 
that's what you've got to face my friend (My friend!)
This ain't the end (End!)
