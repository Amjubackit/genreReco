[Intro]
Whew, it sure is hot out here, you know
I don't mind, though
I'm glad to be free, you know what I'm saying?
Uh
[Chorus]
Take the shackles off my feet so I can dance
I just wanna praise You
What you wanna do? - spoken
I just wanna praise You
Yeah, yeah
You broke the chains now I can lift my hands
Feel me?
And I'm gonna praise You
What you gonna do?
I'm gonna praise you
[Verse 1]
In the corners of my mind
I just can't seem to find
A reason to believe
That I can break free
Cause you see I have been bound for so long
Felt like all hope was gone
But as I lift my hands
I understand
That I should praise You through my circumstance
[Chorus]
Take the shackles off my feet so I can dance
I just wanna praise You
I just wanna praise You
You broke the chains now I can lift my hands
I can lift my hands
And I'm gonna praise You
I'm gonna praise you
[Verse 2]
Everything that could go wrong
All went wrong at one time
So much pressure fell on me
I thought I was gonna lose my mind
Lord I know You wanna see
If I will hold on through these trials
But I need You to lift this load
Cause I can't take it no more
[Chorus]
Take the shackles off my feet so I can dance
So I can dance
I just wanna praise You
I just wanna praise You
You broke the chains now I can lift my hands
Oh yeah
And I'm gonna praise You
I'm gonna praise you
[Bridge]
Been through the fire and the rain
Bound in every kind of way
But God has broken every chain
So let me go right now
[Chorus]
Yeah
Take the shackles off my feet so I can dance
I just wanna praise You
I just wanna praise You
I wanna praise You
You broke the chains now I can lift my hands
I can lift my hands
And I'm gonna praise You
I'm gonna praise you
[Chorus]
Take the shackles off my feet so I can dance
I just wanna praise You
I just wanna praise You
Lord, I just want to
Yeah, yeah
You broke the chains now I can lift my hands
And I'm gonna praise You
I'm gonna praise you
Take the shackles off my feet so I can dance
I just wanna praise You
I just wanna praise You
You broke the chains now I can lift my hands
And I'm gonna praise You
I'm gonna praise you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
[Outro]
Take em off, take em off
What you gonna do?
Yeah, yeah
You broke the chains now I can lift my hands
Lift off the chains
What you gonna do?
