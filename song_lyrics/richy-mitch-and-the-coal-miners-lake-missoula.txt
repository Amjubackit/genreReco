[Verse 1]
Of all calamities
It’s a great one
I’m breaking myself down
Breaking myself down a bit too much
I'm eroding
I'm eroding my sense of pride
Crossroading
At a crossroads in my life
[Verse 2]
I’m bursting at the britches
Gonna leave a nasty scar
I might not be the one
Who never thought they’d get this far
Lake Missoula I’m letting you out!
[Outro]
Oooooh
Oooooh
