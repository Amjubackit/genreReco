[Intro]
You feel that? You better hold on
This one's about to get bumpy
Hahahahahahahaha...
[Verse 1]
She's a ten, hell bent
I'm in heaven tonight
Six speed, sex scene
Playing out in my mind
One look, I'm hooked
Motor runnin'
Left off
My heart started pumpin'
[Pre-Chorus]
Are you ready for the best damn ride of your life?
[Chorus 1]
Give me a "Hell"
Give me a "Yeah"
Stand up right now
And give me a "Hell"
Give me a "Yeah"
Stand up right now
