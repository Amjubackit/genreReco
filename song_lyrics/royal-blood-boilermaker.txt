[Verse 1]
I was looking for some kind of saviour
Someone still counting on my worst behaviour
Knew there would be trouble with devil eyes and magic hands
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm all mixed up
[Chorus]
Head like a cocktail shaker
Living in a house like an old bodega
Got the odds looking in my favour
Staring at the bottom of a boilermaker
[Post-Chorus]
So keep your feet on the ground
And listen to the sound of a real moneymaker
[Verse 2]
Something's twisted up right inside me
I'll let you use it up, so when you do leave
Take me to the edge and let me show you what was on my mind
Don't put all your money on me 'cause you and me are two of a kind
Going in blind
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm all mixed up[Chorus]
Head like a cocktail shaker
Living in a house like an old bodega
Got the odds looking in my favour
Staring at the bottom of a boilermaker
[Post-Chorus]
I'm all mixed up
Like a boilermaker
[Instrumental Break]
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm all mixed up
[Chorus]
Head like a cocktail shaker
Staring at the bottom of a boilermaker
I'm all mixed up
Head like a cocktail shaker
Living in a house like an old bodega
Got the odds looking in my favour
Staring at the bottom of a boilermaker
