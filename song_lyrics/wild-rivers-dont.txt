[Verse 1]
Late night driving with my arm around your shoulder
We're not waking up your roommate so we’re coming through the back door
And I’m so okay now and I hardly ever think about her
Feels like we’ve been doing this longer than we have
[Pre-Chorus]
This feels like a safe place
But I’m still kinda changing
If I don’t stop this train it’s going on and on and on
[Chorus]
I thought time would change it but it won't
And there’s no good reason I should go
‘Cause I’m not much better on my own
But you know when you know and I don’t
You can’t pull water out of stone
And I can’t say anything went wrong
And it kills me leaving you alone
But you know when you know and I don’t
[Verse 2]
It’s a hard conversation that I’ve almost come to terms with
And I met your mom and brother and I know thеy really liked me
I wanna movе across the country, not worry about calling
‘Cause I've seen the way this goes and I don’t wanna go there
[Pre-Chorus]
This is gonna cut you
But I still kinda love you
But if I do this right it'll be alright, right?
[Chorus]
I thought time would change it but it won't
And there’s no good reason I should go
‘Cause I’m not much better on my own
But you know when you know and I don’t
You can’t pull water out of stone
And I can’t say anything went wrong
And it kills me leaving you alone
But you know when you know and I
[Bridge]
I don't wanna stop but I'm gonna walk away
‘Cause I know we're better off and someone's gotta say it
So I'm gonna cut this off before you waste four years just waiting
[Chorus]
I thought time would change it but it won't
And there’s no good reason I should go
‘Cause I’m not much better on my own
But you know when you know and I don’t
You can’t pull water out of stone
And I can’t say anything went wrong
And it kills me leaving you alone
But you know when you know and I don’t
