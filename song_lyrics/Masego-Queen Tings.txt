[Verse 1: Masego]
I see Lupita
You know I got the Jones
For my own Rashida
Can you put me on
With Danai Gurira?
She stay on my dome
[Refrain: Masego]
She gon' pull on me
Pull like weed
Entice me
[Chorus: Masego]
She my queen (Yeah, woah, yeah, woah, yeah)
She my queen (Yeah, woah, yeah, woah, yeah)
She my queen (Yeah, woah, yeah, woah, yeah)
[Refrain: Masego]
She gon' pull on me
Pull like weed
Entice me
[Verse 2: Masego]
Oh, Sharon Leal
She stay down the hall
Or I call Regina
Keep your bonnet on
It stay on for Lisa
She more Solange Knowles
