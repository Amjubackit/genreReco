[Verse 1]
My girlfriend's a dick magnet
My girlfriend gotta have it
She's hot, can't stop, up on stage, doing shots
Tip the man, he'll ring the bell
Get her drunk, she'll scream like hell
Dirty girl, gettin' down, dance with guys from outta town
Grab her ass, actin' tough, mess with her, she'll fuck you up
No one really knows if she's drunk or if she's stoned
But she's coming back to my place tonight
[Chorus]
She likes to shake her ass, she grinds it to the beat
She likes to pull my hair when I make her grind her teeth
I like to strip her down, she's naughty to the end
You know what she is, no doubt about it
She's a bad, bad girlfriend
[Verse 2]
Red thong, party's on, love this song, sing along
Come together, leave alone, see you later back at home
No one really knows if she's drunk or if she's stoned
But she's coming back to my place tonight
I say, no one really knows just how far she's gonna go
But I'm gonna find out later tonight
