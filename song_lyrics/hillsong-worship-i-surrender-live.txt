[Verse 1]
Here I am
Down on my knees again
Surrendering all
Surrendering all
And find me here
Lord as You draw me near
I'm desperate for You
I'm desperate for You
I surrender
[Verse 2]
Drench my soul
As mercy and grace unfold
I hunger and thirst
I hunger and thirst
With arms stretched wide
I know You hear my cry
Speak to me now
Speak to me now
[Chorus]
I surrender
I surrender
I want to know You more
I want to know You more
I surrender
I surrender
I want to know You more
I want to know You more
[Interlude]
[Bridge 1]
Like a rushing wind
Jesus breathe within
Lord have Your way
Lord have Your way in me!
Like a mighty storm
Stir within my soul
Lord have Your way
Lord have Your way in me!
Like a rushing wind
Jesus breathe within
Lord have Your way
Lord have Your way in me!
Like a mighty storm
Stir within my soul
Lord have Your way
Lord have Your way in me!
[Interlude]
[Bridge 2]
Like a rushing wind
Jesus breathe within
Lord have Your way
Lord have Your way in me!
Like a mighty storm
Stir within my soul
Lord have Your way
Lord have Your way in me!
Lord have Your way
Lord have Your way in me!
[Chorus]
I surrender
I surrender
I want to know You more
I want to know You more
I surrender
I surrender
I want to know You more
I want to know You more
