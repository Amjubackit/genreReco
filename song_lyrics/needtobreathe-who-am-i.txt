[Intro]
Woo-oo-oo
Woo-oo-oo
[Verse 1]
White lies and desperation
Hard times and conversations
No one (No one) should ever love me like You do
[Verse 2]
Sometimes my bad decisions
Define my false suspicions
No one should ever love me like You do
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, while I'm on this road, You take my hand
Somehow You really love who I really am
I push You away, still You won't let go
You grow Your roses on my barren soul
[Chorus]
Who am I, who am I, who am I
To be loved by You?
Who am I, who am I, who am I
To be loved by You?
Who am I, who am I, who am I
To be loved by You?
Who am I, who am I, who am I?
[Verse 3]
Last night, confidence was shaken
My wounds and my past was saying
No one should ever love me like You do
[Pre-Chorus]
While I'm on this road, You take my hand
Somehow You really love who I really am
I push You away, still You won't let go
You grow Your roses on my barren soul
[Chorus]
Who am I, who am I, who am I
To be loved by You?
Who am I, who am I, who am I
To be loved by You?
Who am I, who am I, who am I
To be loved by You?
Who am I, who am I, who am I?
[Bridge]
The way I push You through it what You had to see
I'm a train wreck, I'm a mess, You see the best and the worst in me
Still I can't imagine that I've earned Your trust
I don't understand where Your love comes from
[Chorus]
Who am I, who am I, who am I
Ayy, to be loved by You?
Who am I, who am I, who am I
To be loved by You?
Who am I, who am I, who am I
To be loved by You?
Who am I, who am I, who am I?
[Outro]
Ayy, to be loved by you?
Who am I, who am I, who am I
To be loved by You?
Who am I, who am I, who am I
To be loved by You?
Who am I, who am I, who am I?
Yeah, to be loved by You?
Who am I, who am I, who am I?
To be loved by You?
