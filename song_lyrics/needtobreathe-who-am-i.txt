[Intro]
Woo-oo-oo
Woo-oo-oo
[Verse 1]
White lies and desperation
Hard times and conversations
No one (No one) should ever love me like You do
[Verse 2]
Sometimes my bad decisions
Define my false suspicions
No one should ever love me like You do
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, while I'm on this road, You take my hand
Somehow You really love who I really am
I push You away, still You won't let go
You grow Your roses on my barren soul
[Chorus]
Who am I, who am I, who am I
To be loved by You?
Who am I, who am I, who am I
To be loved by You?
Who am I, who am I, who am I
To be loved by You?
Who am I, who am I, who am I?
