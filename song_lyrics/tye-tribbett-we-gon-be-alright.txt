[Verse 1]
It gets so hard
Just trying to figure it out, fighting doubt
Tryna believe God
Tryna watch the words of my mouth and stay on the route
Troubles come and go
Even on the mountain high or the valley low
Never let your faith go (Ooh)
Never let your faith go (Yeah)
[Verse 2]
I've been there before
So confused, don't know which way to go, ay
Stressed out
World so crazy might as well as stay in the house
Fear tryna rise up
Got terrorist disguised, they look like us
But we know who we trust
Trust when I say that
[Chorus]
We gon' be alright, we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright, alright
We gon' be alright, we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright, alright
