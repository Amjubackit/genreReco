[Verse 1]
It gets so hard
Just trying to figure it out, fighting doubt
Tryna believe God
Tryna watch the words of my mouth and stay on the route
Troubles come and go
Even on the mountain high or the valley low
Never let your faith go (Ooh)
Never let your faith go (Yeah)
[Verse 2]
I've been there before
So confused, don't know which way to go, ay
Stressed out
World so crazy might as well as stay in the house
Fear tryna rise up
Got terrorist disguised, they look like us
But we know who we trust
Trust when I say that
[Chorus]
We gon' be alright, we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright, alright
We gon' be alright, we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright, alright
[Verse 3]
In these last days
Evil times will come and it's here today
Look at all the hate
Senseless crime and murder every day
Human trafficking, racism, police brutality
Bullying, rape, child molesta-
Shun the appearance of evil I pray
[Verse 4]
Let Your Kingdom come, let Your will be done
In the Earth
Let Your glory rise, let Your Son shine
Let it burst
Through the dark clouds
Even through the storm and the rain
We will shout
'Cause we know after the night
[Chorus]
We gon' be alright
Hey, all things work together for good
We gon' be alright (Wooh)
Time and time again He brought me out, I knew He would
We gon' be alright, ay
I ain't worried 'bout it (Oh no)
Don't you worry 'bout it, ay (Oh no)
I believe, I receive every word that He promised me
We gon' be alright (Wooh, oh Jesus)
We gon' be alright (Ay, we believe You)
We gon' be alright
Ay, don't worry 'bout it (Oh no)
Don't lose no sleep over it, ay (Oh no)
Just believe and receive every word that He promised ya
We gon' be alright
So lift your hands up
We gon' be alright
Ay, hallelujah
Just give Him worship, yeah
We gon' be alright
I ain't worried 'bout it (Oh no)
I won't lose sleep over it, ay (Oh no)
He got everything under control, that's how I know that
We gon' be alright
We gon' be alright (Yeah)
We gon' be alright
The battle isn't yours, this belongs to the Lord
Stand still, don't fight, we know that
We gon' be alright
[Outro]
It's gonna be alright now
It's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright now
It's gonna be alright
You're gonna be alright now
Be alright
It's gonna be alright now
