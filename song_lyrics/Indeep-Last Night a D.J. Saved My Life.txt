[Verse 1]
Last night a DJ saved my life
Last night a DJ saved my life, yeah
'Cause I was sittin' there bored to death
And in just one breath, he said
"You got get up, you got get up, you got get down, girl"
You know you drive me crazy, baby
You've got me turnin' to another man
Called you on the phone, no one's home
Baby, why you leave me all alone?
And if it wasn't for the music, I don't know what I'd do, yeah
[Hook]
Last night a DJ saved my life
Last night a DJ saved my life from a broken heart
Last night a DJ saved my life
Last night a DJ saved my life with a song
[Verse 2]
