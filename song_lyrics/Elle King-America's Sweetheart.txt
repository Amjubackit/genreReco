[Verse 1]
No, there ain't nothing that I gotta prove
You think your words'll make me black and blue
But I, I think I'm pretty with these old boots on
I think it's funny when I drink too much, hey
You try and change me, you can go to hell
'Cause I don't wanna be nobody else
I like the chip I got in my front teeth
And I got bad tattoos you won't believe
[Pre-Chorus]
So kick out the jams, kick up the soul
Pour another glass of that rock 'n' roll
Turn up the band, fire in the hole
Gonna lose control tonight
[Chorus]
What do you want from me?
I'm not America's sweetheart
So beat the drum with me
I'm not America's sweetheart
Well, they said I'm too loud for this town
So I lit a match and burned it down
What do you want from me?
I'm not America's sweetheart
But you love me anyway
