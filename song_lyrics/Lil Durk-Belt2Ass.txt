[Intro]
I don't
 wanna be another rockstar
People tellin' me that I am
I'm just a rockstar from the trenches
I'm just a rockstar from the trenches
I'm just a rockstar for the trenches
(I'm just a rockstar for the trenches)
[Verse 1]
I'm just a rockstar for the trenches
I ain't see my mama sad in a minute
I gave her everything, you can't trick her
I told my daughters to watch out for niggas
I'm at a jet airport with a killer
Too much drank, I done threw up out the window
I was smart, I wasn't movin' with niggas
That wasn't me, you confused me with niggas
Goin' broke? I can't imagine it
Fuck it off, I hold the line of Saks
Dominos, that's the hater effect
Icy cold, they caught me drinkin' the Act'
Charge the 'Rari, where the battery at?
I confess, where the therapy at?
Lost so many niggas, feel like a test
Made my daughter mad, I get her baguettes
Ain't no vaccines, just give me a six
Ain't got time to really lay with a bitch
I be on hard when she lay on my dick
Half of you niggas my only regret
Gotta react what they put on the 'net
Answer the phone, ain't gon' never forget
Answer the jail calls, yeah
Answer the jail calls, yeah
I can count how many times you helped me up
Plenty times I was on my back, you ain't help me up
Act like they with me, whole time laughin' it up
I made it out the trenches, I'm blessed to be up
