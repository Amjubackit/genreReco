[Verse 1: Anitta]
You tell me you're leaving today
You're packing your bags up for good
I'm not gonna stand in your way
Baby, I'd cry if I could, but
[Chorus: Anitta]
I keep faking love
I keep faking love with you
I been faking love
I been faking love, it's true
Now we breaking up
Now we breaking up, boo-hoo
But I been faking love
I been faking love with you
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Verse 2: Saweetie]
Boy, bye
Thought I was a fool, nice try
Need a invoice for my time
You done killed my vibe
Thinkin' I'm a ride or die
Matter a fact, click-clack, bye
They know why, ain't no one surprised I'm in these streets
Let me live my life, throw a party when you leave, leave, leavе
[Verse 3: Saweetie & Anitta]
Hey, Anitta, we're thе divas
With a 401k in Ibiza
And she bonita, I wanna meet her
Can you balance work and pleasure like a libra?
I'm at Ipanema with a couple bad bitches (Yeah)
Tannin' topless and we takin' mad pictures (Uh-huh)
Fragile ego, now you gotta gas niggas
Faking love, I need somethin' that's realer
[Verse 4: Anitta]
Feel like I'm running out of ways to say (Say)
That I ain't feeling any type of way about you
Keep getting caught up when your hands on me
Like ooh, I (Want it), I (Got it), ain't sorry, but I got
All I'm needin', all I need
I'll be leaving, I'll be gone (Gone), gone
Do as I please, oh, baby, it's too easy to let you go (Oh-oh)
So (Yeah)
[Chorus: Anitta]
I keep faking love
I keep faking love with you
I been faking love
I been faking love, it's true
Now we breaking up
Now we breaking up, boo-hoo
But I been faking love
I been faking love with you
[Instrumental Bridge: Anitta]
I been faking love with you
[Chorus: Anitta]
I keep faking love (Yeah, yeah)
I keep faking love with you (Yeah, yeah)
I been faking love (Ha!)
I been faking love, it's true (Oh)
Now we breaking up (Breaking up)
Now we breaking up, boo-hoo
But I been faking love
I been faking love with you
