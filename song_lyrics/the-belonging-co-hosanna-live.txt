[Verse 1]
Humble King
You chose the road that led to suffering
Nothing was spared to prove Your love for me
Oh, the mystery
That Your final breath became eternity
What we had lost forever You redeemed, mmm
[Chorus]
Hosanna, Hosanna
In the highest forever
Hosanna, Hosanna
Hallelujah forever
[Verse 2]
Triumphant King
The Lamb who was slain who rose in majesty
There's never a heart beyond Your victory
You are the one that we are welcoming
You are the one that we are welcoming, oh
[Chorus]
Hosanna, Hosanna
In the highest forever
Hosanna, Hosanna
Hallelujah forever
Hosanna, Hosanna
In the highest forever
Hosanna, Hosanna
Hallelujah forever
[Spontaneous]
Ooh, forever
We worship You forever, forever
It's all about You
[Bridge]
Blessed is He, blessed is He
Who comes in the name of the Lord
Oh, join now and sing, Jesus is King
He reigns forevermore
Blessed is He, blessed is He
Who comes in the name of the Lord
Join now and sing, Jesus is King
He reigns forevermore
Blessed is He, blessed is He
Who comes in the name of the Lord
Join now and sing, Jesus is King
He reigns forevermore
[Chorus]
Hosanna, Hosanna
In the highest forever
Hosanna, Hosanna
Hallelujah forever
Hosanna, Hosanna
In the highest forever
Hosanna, Hosanna
Hallelujah forever
Hosanna, Hosanna
In the highest forever
Hosanna, Hosanna
Hallelujah forever
