[Instrumental Intro]
[Verse 1]
Well, my mama, she didn't allow me just to stay out all night long
Oh Lord
Well, my mama didn't allow me just to stay out all night long
I didn't care what she didn't allow
I would boogie-woogie anyhow
[Verse 2]
When I first came to town, people, I was walkin' down Hastings Street
I heard everybody talkin' about the Henry Swing Club
I decided I'd drop in there that night
And when I got there, I said: "Yes, people"
Yes, they was really havin' a ball
Yes, I know
Boogie Chillen
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 3]
One night I was layin' down
I heard mama and papa talkin'
I heard papa tell mama to let that boy boogie-woogie
'Cause it's in him and it got to comе out
Well, I felt so good
And I went on boogiе-woogiein' just the same
