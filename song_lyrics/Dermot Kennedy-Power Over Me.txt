[Verse 1]
I wanna be king in your story
I wanna know who you are
I want your heart to beat for me
Oh, I
Want you to sing to me softly
'Cause then I'm outrunning the dark
That's all that love ever taught me
Oh, I
[Pre-Chorus]
Call and I'll rush out
All out of breath now
[Chorus]
You've got that power over me, my my
Everything I hold dear resides in those eyes
You've got that power over me, my my
The only one I know, the only one on my mind
You've got that power over me (My my)
You've got that power over me (My my)
You've got that power over me
[Verse 2]
Remember the lake in the moonlight?
Remember you shivered and shone?
I'll never forget what you looked like on that night
But I know that time's gonna take me
I know that day's gonna come
I just want the devil to hate me
Oh, I
