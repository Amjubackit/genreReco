[Verse 1]
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
It's been a long year
Would we survive in a horror movie?
I doubt it we're too slow moving
We trust everyone we meet
Two bodies riddled with scars from our pre-teens
Intertwine in a car's dirty backseat
And stare at a drive-in screen
[Pre-Chorus]
We didn't know that the sun was collapsing
'Til the seas rose and the buildings came crashing
We cried oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
[Chorus]
Everywhere, everything, I wanna love you
'Til we're food for the worms to eat
'Til our fingers decompose, keep my hands in yours
Everywhеre, everything, I wanna lovе you
'Til we're food for the worms to eat
'Til our fingers decompose, keep my hands in yours
[Verse 2]
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Drive slowly, 
I know every route in this county
Maybe that ain't such a bad thing
I'll tell where not to speed
It's been a long year
And all of our book's pages dog-eared
We'll write out the ends on our palms dear
Then forget to read[Pre-Chorus]
We didn't know that the sun was collapsing
'Til the seas rose and the buildings came crashing
We cried oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
[Chorus]
Everywhere, everything, I wanna love you
'Til we're food for the worms to eat
'Til our fingers decompose, keep my hands in yours
Everywhere, everything, I wanna love you
'Til we're food for the worms to eat
'Til our fingers decompose, keep my hands in yours
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Chorus]
Everywhere, everything, I wanna love you
'Til we're food for the worms to eat
'Til our fingers decompose, keep my hands in yours
