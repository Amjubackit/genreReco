[Intro]
Padam
Padam
[Verse 1]
(
Padam
) You look like fun to me
(
Padam
) You look a little like somebody I know
(
Padam
) And I can tell you how this ends
(
Padam
) 
I'll be in your head all weekend
(
Padam
) Shivers and butterflies
(
Padam
) I get the shivers when I look into your eyes
(
Padam
) And I can tell that you're all in
(
Padam
) 'Cause I can hear your heart beatin'
[Pre-Chorus]
Padam (Padam)
[Chorus]
Padam, padam
, I hear it and I know
Padam, padam
, I know you wanna take me home
Padam, and get to know me close
Padam, padam, when your heart goes
Padam, padam
, I hear it and I know
Padam, padam
, I know you wanna take me home
Padam
, and take off all my clothes
Padam, padam, when your hеart goes "padam"[Verse 2]
This place is crowdin' up
I think it's time for you to takе me out this club
And we don't need to use our words
Wanna see what's underneath that T-shirt
Shivers and cold champagne
I get the shivers every time you say my name
And I can tell that you're all in (All in)
'Cause I can hear your heart beatin'
[Pre-Chorus]
(
Padam, padam
)
 'Cause I can hear your heart beatin'
[Chorus]
Padam, padam
, I hear it and I know
Padam, padam
, I know you wanna take me home
Padam, and get to know me close
Padam, padam, when your heart goes
Padam, padam
, I hear it and I know
Padam, padam
, I know you wanna take me home
Padam
, and take off all my clothes (Take off all my)
Padam, padam, when your heart goes "padam"
