[Verse 1]
The clouds move over Pontiac skies
Their silent thunder matches mine
I know this feeling from long ago
I wondered, was it gone? But now I know
[Pre-Chorus]
So when she calls, don't send her my way
When it hurts, you'll know it's the right thing
[Chorus]
Michigan's in the rear-view now
Keep your hands where I could see 'em
You took the words right out my mouth
When you knew that I would need 'em
What am I supposed to do now?
Without you
Without you
[Verse 2]
It's unannounced like you'd expect it
I'm on broke down brake lines and Motown records
And all that's left is a blind reflection
But you know what's coming and you regret it
[Pre-Chorus]
So when she calls, don't send her my way
When it hurts most it's the right thing
[Chorus]
Michigan's in the rear-view now
Keep your hands where I could see 'em
You took the words right out my mouth
When you knew that I would need 'em
What am I supposed to do now?
Without you
Without you
Michigan's in the rear-view now
Keep your hands where I could see 'em
You took the words right out my mouth
When you knew that I would need 'em
What am I supposed to do now?
Without you
Without you
