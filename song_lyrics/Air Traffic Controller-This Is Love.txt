[Verse 1]
You're no good, you're no good
You could kill me and you should
I'm an idiot for thinking
This was anything but blood
On the wall, on the couch
On the corner of my mouth
You must like being the victim
You've done nothing to get out
Of this pattern of pain
Washed away by the rain
You'll forgive me if I promise
And do nothing but the same
This is life until death
Could be my last dying breath
But this is love, love, shut up, this is love
[Hook]
Forget everything you used to know
I think you better tell your friends to go
Stick around 'cause I'm about to show you
The beginning is the end
