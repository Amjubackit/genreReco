[Verse 1]
I wanna be there when the voices in your head
Are loud enough to make you lose your mind
Just the same when you're dominating the day
I wanna be the one who's by your side
[Pre-Chorus]
You know my love is not the jealous type
It doesn't matter if we win or lose
I could stay or I could come
No matter where you're coming from
I could be the one to let you choose
[Chorus]
I wanna hold you close but never hold you back
Just like the banks to the river
And if you ever feel like you are not enough
I'm gonna break all your mirrors
I wanna be there when the darkness closes in
To make the truth a little clearer
I wanna hold you close but never hold you back
I'll be the banks for your river
[Post-Chorus]
I'll be the banks for your river
I'll be the banks for your river
[Verse 2]
You are beautiful and wild at every turn
Who am I to take control of that?
Everybody needs a voice they can follow
When the water and the winds get bad
[Pre-Chorus]
You know my love is not the jealous type
And it don't matter if we win or lose
I could push or I could pull
No matter what you're trying to do
As long as I can flow along with you
[Chorus]
I wanna hold you close but never hold you back
Just like the banks to the river
And if you ever feel like you are not enough
I'm gonna break all your mirrors
I wanna be there when the darkness closes in
To make the truth a little clearer
I wanna hold you close but never hold you back
I'll be the banks for your river
[Post-Chorus]
I'll be the banks for your river
I'll be the banks for your river
[Bridge]
Baby, I ain't saying that you need my help
But you don't have to do it all by yourself
So, baby, when the current gets strong
And you need somewhere to rest your bones
I wanna be there for you
I wanna be strong for you, oh, oh, oh
[Chorus]
I wanna hold you close but never hold you back
Just like the banks to the river
And if you ever feel like you are not enough
I'm gonna break all your mirrors
I wanna be there when the darkness closes in
To make the truth a little clearer
I wanna hold you close but never hold you back
I'll be the banks for your river
[Outro]
I wanna hold you close but never hold you back
(I'll be the banks for your river)
And if you ever feel like you are not enough
(I'll be the banks for your river)
I wanna be there when the darkness closes in
To make the truth a little clearer
I wanna hold you close but never hold you back
I'll be the banks for your river
