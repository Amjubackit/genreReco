[Verse 1]
Drivin' through the night, tryna keep my eyes open
Generator's busted and the A/C's broken
Talkin' to the Lord, hope He helps us get there safe
And we made it to the show, now we're singin' to the crowd
And play an encore and they're screamin' real loud
Try to get home early, but I know that ain't the case
[Chorus]
Yeah, it's another hotel room, sleepin' on the floor
I'm hurtin' in the mornin' from the night before
Paid my duеs, I'm leadin' up the road
I'm comin' home, baby, lеave the porch light on
[Verse 2]
Breakfast in the morning from seven to nine
But we just can't seem to wake up in time
Grab a cup of coffee and we're off to hit the road
Now we're runnin' on fumes, no time to kill
We got one more show and it's a shitty door deal
Breakin' my back just to make a couple bones
[Chorus]
Yeah, it's another hotel room, sleepin' on the floor
I'm hurtin' in the mornin' from the night before
Paid my dues, I'm leadin' up the road
I'm comin' home, baby, leave the porch light on
