[Intro]
Oh, when you need a hand
I will be your friend
Oh, when you need a hand
Oh, I will be your friend
[Chorus]
Take it easy, yeah
Make yourself right at home, hm, hm
Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
And never leave me, yeah
You don't have to feel alone, hm, hm
Yeah, oh, oh
[Verse 1]
I will slip off your shoes and find your feet
Let everything come naturally
I'll loosen the grip of what you need
Home is a state of mind, you'll see
I know you've been searchin' for better days
So somehow, I hope you hear me say
[Chorus]
Take it easy, yeah
Make yourself right at home, hm, hm
Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
And never leave me, yeah
You don't have to feel alone, hm, hm
Yeah, oh, oh[Verse 2]
Oh, no surprise, just open your eyes
Come right in, take off your disguise
Leave your worries right at the door
Watch them as they drop to the floor
Oh, I wouldn't (Yeah)
Have it any other way
I left the room for better days
Your life is sweet like Minute Maid
You shouldn't (Mm)
Feel the need to lose your faith
The seasons come and go and change
I just hope you'll hear me say
[Chorus]
Take it easy, yeah
Make yourself right at home, hm, hm
Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
And never leave me, yeah
You don't have to feel alone, hm, hm
Yeah, oh, oh
[Bridge]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
[Chorus]
Take it easy, yeah
Make yourself right at home, hm, hm
Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
And never leave me, yeah
You don't have to feel alone, hm, hm
Yeah, oh, oh
