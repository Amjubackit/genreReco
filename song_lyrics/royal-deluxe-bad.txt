[Intro]
Woah, oh, woah, oh
[Verse 1]
I make the devil run
I gave them poison, just for fun
I had one friend, now there's none
I make the devil run
I broke so many bones
But none of them were ever my own
They were an army, I was alone
I broke so many bones
Oh, woah, oh
Oh, woah, oh
[Chorus]
I’m bad, as bad can be
So bad, that it's hard to believe
Oh, what they say about me
(I'm bad, I’m bad, as bad as can be)
I'm bad, take a look and see
So bad, that it's hard to believe
I don't care what they say about me
(I'm bad, I'm bad, as bad can be)
[Verse 2]
I watched an empire fall
I stormed the gate and scared the walls
They wouldn't share, so I took it all
I watched an empire fall
Oh, woah, oh
Oh, woah, oh[Chorus]
I'm bad, as bad can be
So bad, that it’s hard to believe
Oh, what they say about me
(I’m bad, I'm bad, as bad as can be)
I’m bad, take a look and see
So bad, that it's hard to believe
I don't care what they say about me
(I'm bad, I’m bad, as bad as can be)
(I'm bad, I'm bad, as bad as can be)
(I'm bad, I'm bad, as bad as can be)
(I'm bad, I'm bad, as bad as can be)
[Bride]
Woah, oh, woah, oh
Try and stop me
Woah, oh, woah, oh
Oh
Woah, oh, woah, oh
You better watch out, watch out, here I come
I'm bad, I'm bad, as bad as can be
I'm bad, I'm bad, as bad as can be
I'm bad, I'm bad, as bad as can be
I'm bad, I'm bad, as bad as can be
[Chorus]
I'm bad, as bad can be
So bad, that it's hard to believe
Oh, what they say about me
(I'm bad, I'm bad, as bad as can be)
I'm bad, take a look and see
So bad, that it's hard to believe
I don't care what they say about me
(I'm bad, I'm bad, as bad as can be)[Outro]
I'm bad, I'm bad, as bad as can be
(I'm bad, I'm bad, as bad as can be)
Oh, so so bad
(I'm bad, I'm bad, as bad as can be)
I'm bad, I'm bad, as bad as can be
(I'm bad, I'm bad, as bad as can be)
