[Intro: SEBASTIAN, spoken]
Okay, okay, listen to me
The human world is a mess
Life under the sea is better than anything they got goin' on up there
[Verse 1: SEBASTIAN]
The seaweed is always greener
In somebody else's lake
You dream about going up there
But that is a big mistake
Just look at the world around you
Right here on the ocean floor
Such wonderful things surround you
What more is you lookin' for?
[Chorus: SEBASTIAN]
Under the sea, under the sea
Darlin', it's better down where it's wettеr
Take it from me
Up on the shorе they work all day
Out in the sun they slave away
While we devotin' full time to floatin'
Under the sea
[Verse 2: SEBASTIAN]
Down here all the fish is happy
As off through the waves they roll
The fish on the land ain't happy
They sad 'cause they in their bowl
But fish in the bowl is lucky
They in for a worser fate
One day when the boss get hungry
Guess who gon' be on the plate?
Oh, no
