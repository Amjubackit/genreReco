[Intro: Lil Durk]
(Zaytoven)
Ayy, Yak
[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
Never take her to Status Jeweler (Yeah)
Never put all your trust in pussy (Let's get it)
I done seen niggas steal switches (Yeah)
I could never be attached to goofies (Metro)
Lamborghini truck, ridin' smoothly
Future had a nigga tryin' zooties (Boom)
Firm believer of bad luck (Yeah)
I can't be the one dyin' in movies (No)
Eater sex, she want her ass done (Ass done)
Told the bitch to go and try a smoothie (Try a smoothie)
Why you throwin' all this rent money?
Tryna prove a point to go and hang with Boosie (Lame-ass)
He think he bigger than the whole mob
Niggas couldn't even hang with Boonie (Gang)
I keep all the shooters fed
I fed 'em all Percocets (Percocets)
Rather be with my crew instead
Ridin' 'round with a dirty stick (Dirty stick)
Dirty Sprite, ridin' 'round with some shooters who ain't even thirty yet (Grrah)
Dirty mics, told on the gang, like he owe us debt (Yeah)
[Chorus: Lil Durk]
Lamb' truck, hoppin' out with thirty chains on and my dreads stuck
Lamb' truck, free Rio from the land, they got him jammed up
Blam somethin', got me feelin' like I'm Grandson
Blam somethin', got me feelin' like I'm—
[Verse 2: Kodak Black]
Ayy, I ain't gon' need no ski, 'cause I'm gon' make sure he can't tell on me
The middle of the week, I was skippin' in school, I had to bail on me
I'm a man of business, I'm with the mob, I'm like M.O.B
My nigga beat the cheese when he went down, I'm like "Damn, homie"
Dirty mics, thuggin' 'til I die, I don't need no advice
Jerry Rice, just caught a brand new body, that's on my baby snipe
Like I'm smokin' crack, the Glock got a see-through clip, this bitch like glass pipes
I ain't tryna be too long, anyway motherfucker, I live that fast life
Friday night, I'm in the club, boppin' with my niggas, yeah
Still goin', Saturday mornin' I woke up with some strippers, yeah
Sunday, I might take a nigga soul, 'cause I'm a sinner, yeah
Lil' Taz, he gon' spaz, he gon' three, four, five, six jiggers, yeah
Friday night, in the car, ridin' with my hitters, yeah
Still scopin', Saturday mornin', lookin' for them niggas, yeah
Sunday, it feel like I'm almighty Jesus with this pistol, yeah
King Von, yeah, 'cause I'm a rapper and I'm a killer, yeah
Durk, go to church, you old killin' motherfucker
Ayy, do that nigga do Percs and them Black & Milds, go call my brother
This my last time fuckin', so I'ma stick it in her butt
Start shootin' shit up at fourteen, vibin', "Dis Ain’t What U Want"
[Chorus: Lil Durk]
Lamb' truck, hoppin' out with thirty chains on and my dreads stuck
Lamb' truck, free Rio from the land, they got him jammed up
Blam somethin', got me feelin' like I'm Grandson
Blam somethin', got me feelin' like I'm—
