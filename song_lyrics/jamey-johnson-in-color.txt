[Verse 1]
I said, "Grandpa what's this picture here?
It's all black and white, and it ain't real clear
Is that you there?", he said, “Yeah, I was eleven”
“And times were tough back in thirty-five
That's me and Uncle Joe just tryna to survive a cotton farm
In a Great Depression”
[Refrain]
If it looks like we were scared to death
Like a couple of kids just tryna save each other
You should’ve seen it in color
[Verse 2]
Oh, and this one here’s taken overseas
In the middle of hell in nineteen forty-three in the wintertime
You can almost see my breath
That was my tail gunner ol' Johnny McGee
He was a high school teacher from New Orleans
And he had my back right through the day we left
[Chorus]
If it looks like we were scared to death
Like a couple of kids just tryna save each other
You should’ve seen it in color
A picture's worth a thousand words
But you can't see what those shades of gray keep covered
You should've seen it in color
