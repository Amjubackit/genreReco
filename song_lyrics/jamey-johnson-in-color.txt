[Verse 1]
I said, "Grandpa what's this picture here?
It's all black and white, and it ain't real clear
Is that you there?", he said, “Yeah, I was eleven”
“And times were tough back in thirty-five
That's me and Uncle Joe just tryna to survive a cotton farm
In a Great Depression”
[Refrain]
If it looks like we were scared to death
Like a couple of kids just tryna save each other
You should’ve seen it in color
[Verse 2]
Oh, and this one here’s taken overseas
In the middle of hell in nineteen forty-three in the wintertime
You can almost see my breath
That was my tail gunner ol' Johnny McGee
He was a high school teacher from New Orleans
And he had my back right through the day we left
[Chorus]
If it looks like we were scared to death
Like a couple of kids just tryna save each other
You should’ve seen it in color
A picture's worth a thousand words
But you can't see what those shades of gray keep covered
You should've seen it in color
[Verse 3]
This one is my favorite one
This is me and Grandma in the summer sun
All dressed up the day we said our vows
You can't tell it here but it was hot that June
And that rose was red and her eyes were blue
And just look at that smile, I was so proud
[Bridge]
That's the story of my life
Right there in black and white
[Chorus]
And if it looks like we were scared to death
Like a couple of kids just tryna save each other
You should’ve seen it in color
Yeah, a picture's worth a thousand words
But you can't see what those shades of gray keep covered
You should’ve seen it in color
[Outro]
(Should’ve seen it in color)
Yeah, a picture's worth a thousand words
But you can't see what those shades of gray keep covered
You should’ve seen it in color
