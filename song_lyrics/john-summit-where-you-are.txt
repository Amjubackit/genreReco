[Verse 1]
Do you dream alone
Under the moon?
Is it brighter, brighter
When I'm with you
Is the afterglow strong enough?
To light this fire, fire
Back in us, woah
[Pre-Chorus]
Mixed emotions
Hearts still open
Though we're far apart
[Chorus]
I get this feeling
I wanna be where you are
I wanna be where you are
I wanna be where you are
I get this feeling
I wanna be where you are
I wanna be where you are
I wanna be wherе you are
[Verse 2]
Are you wide awakе?
Counting the stars
Or just lying, lying
In the dark, woah[Pre-Chorus]
Mixed emotions
Hearts still open
Though we're far apart
[Chorus]
I get this feeling
I wanna be where you are
I wanna be where you are
I wanna be where you are
I get this feeling
I wanna be where you are
I wanna be where you are
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
I wanna be where you are
I get this feeling
I wanna be where you are
I wanna be where you are
I wanna be where you are
I get this feeling
I wanna be where you are
I wanna be where you are
I wanna be where you are
