[Verse 1]
A spiritual battle for my peace
Man, I'm just tryna keep my peace
My peace but I'm still running, surviving
Ooh, my spirit is still getting tired
Gotta get out this environment
My peace feel like something coming after me
Tryna come after my mind
Can't let it get to my heart
It wanna come for my soul
But I won't fold it gave me control
Life is the wild side, woah, oh
[Chorus]
I'm chasing down the darkness
I'm not afraid, I am the light
I rule over my rivals
I command and dominate
The jungle (Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)
I am a ruler, yeah (Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)
Fear won't take over me
[Verse 2]
Life is a jungle it's wild, beast
Might as well show up in style, eat, wow, sheesh
The media all about clout, see
So much American violence
Killing us dead in the aisles man
Lord have mercy
I'm even concerned about my seed
Terrorists still running the land
Terrified 'cause we don't know they plans
All day feels like taking a chance
Blood stains on my soul from their hands
This is the wild side, ooh, woah
