[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
I said, "Settle down, settle down, everything is fine
Take your eyes off the floor"
She said, "No, I'm not, no, I'm not, no, I'm not alright
I lost my head on the door"
[Pre-Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
She's a-a-a-antisocial, a-a-a-antisocial
A-a-and she's an angel, yeah
[Chorus: Matt Skiba and 
Mark Hoppus
]
I'm in deep with this girl, but she's out of her mind
She said "Babe, I'm sorry, but I'm crazy tonight"
She got a black shirt, black skirt,
 
and Bauhaus stuck in her head
I'm in deep with this girl, but she's out of her mind, oh yeah
[Post-Chorus: Mark Hoppus and 
Matt Skiba
]
We all need something to live for
, oh yeah
We all need something to live for
[Verse 2: Matt Skiba]
She said, "I let her down, let her down, I no longer dream
Of anything anymore"
Said I'm a know-it-all, know-it-all, "You make me want to scream"
And threw herself on the floor
