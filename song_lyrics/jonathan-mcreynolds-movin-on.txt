[Verse 1: Jonathan McReynolds]
I'm closing chapters
I'm turning pages
Glory to glory
And from faith to favor
[Refrain: Jonathan McReynolds]
I'm moving on
I'm moving on
I'm moving on
[Verse 2: Jonathan McReynolds]
I'm getting older
So I'll keep it straight
It hurts to let go
But it hurts more to stay
[Refrain: Jonathan McReynolds]
I'm moving on
I'm moving on, hey
I'm moving on
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
[Chorus: Jonathan McReynolds]
I know my rearview (Ooh, ooh)
Can't compare to what God will do with my life (Ooh, ooh)
I am forgetting what's behind me (Ooh, ooh)
I have finally decided (Ooh, ooh)
[Refrain: Jonathan McReynolds]
I'll be moving on
I'm moving on
I'm moving on
[Verse 2: Mali Music & Jonathan McReynolds]
My mother taught me
She taught me well
Forget your failures
And forgive yourself
[Refrain: Jonathan McReynolds, Mali Music, Both]
I'm moving on
I'm moving on
I'm moving on
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
[Chorus: Jonathan McReynolds & Mali Music]
I know my rearview
Can't compare to what God will do with my life
And I am forgetting what's behind me
I have finally decided
I know my rearview
Can't compare to what God will do with my life (I know He'll do it in my life)
And now I'm forgetting what's behind me
I have finally decided
[Refrain: Jonathan McReynolds & Mali Music]
I'll be moving on (Moving)
I'm moving on (Yeah)
I'm moving on (Oh-oh-oh, hey hey hey)
I'm moving on (Know that I will be)
I'm moving on (Know that I will)
I'm moving on (Hey, forgetting what's behind me, focusing on what's inside me)
I'm moving on (Christ ahead, and I'm just in this party)
I'm moving on (Never would've loved this party)
I'm moving on (I pride myself on bringing light to Your parties)
I'm moving on (Holy Ghost, You rectify the mind)
I'm moving on (It's powder, I'm a dry land)
I'm moving on (Without Your power, I'm a nightmare)
I'm moving on (Nothing but trouble, saying bye man)
I'm moving on (Can't have too much on the diamond)
I'm moving on (My brother called me, I could cry man)
I'm moving on (Told me we're moving up in God's hands)
I'm moving on (Told me we moving up in God's hands)
I'm moving on (Told me we moving up in God's hands)
I'm moving on (Told me we moving up in God's hands)
[Outro: Mali Music]
Told me we moving up in God's hands
