[Intro]
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ahem, ahem
[Verse 1]
Hey, baby, won't you look my way?
I can be your new addiction
Hey, baby, what you got to say?
All you're giving me is fiction
I'm a sorry sucker and this happens all the time
[Pre-Chorus]
I find out that everybody talks
Everybody talks, everybody talks
[Chorus]
It started with a whisper
And that was when I kissed her
And then she made my lips hurt
I can hear the chit-chat
Take me to your love shack
Mama's always gotta backtrack
When everybody talks back
[Verse 2]
Hey, honey, you could be my drug
You could be my new prescription
Too much could be an overdose
All this trash-talk make me itchin'
