[Verse 1]
Found me here again
In the place we met
Where hopelessness meets grace
Quiet all the noise
Every whispered lie
Put to rest by perfect peace
Even in my doubt
I will not forget
You are faithful still to me
I won't take a single step
'Til I hear Your voice, I surrender
[Chorus]
When my eyes cannot see
It's Your voice that's leading me
Out of darkness
And into light
It's Your love
That's breaking through the night
I won't move until You speak
I won't move until You speak
{Verse 2]
Here I wait for You
In the silence now
I'm holding onto Your truth
I won't take a single step
Until I hear Your voice, I surrender[Chorus]
And when my eyes cannot see
It's Your voice that's leading me
Out of darkness
And into light
It's Your love
That's breaking through the night
I won't move until You speak
I won't move until You speak
I won't move until You speak
I won't move until You speak
[Verse 3]
You break the walls apart
You heal the wounded heart
I won't move until You speak
You calm the raging sea
You crush the enemy
I won't move until You speak
You break the walls apart
You heal the wounded heart
You've been there from the start
I won't move until You speak
You calm the raging sea
You crush the enemy
Oh, You set the broken free
I won't move until You speak[Chorus]
When my eyes cannot see
It's Your voice that's leading me
Out of darkness
And into light
It's Your love
That's breaking through the night
I won't move until You speak
I won't move until You speak
