[Verse 1: Vic Fuentes]
Sunshine
There ain't a thing that you can do that's gonna ruin my night
(But there's just something about)
This dizzy dreamer and her bleeding little blue boy
Licking your fingers like you're done and
You've decided there is so much more than me (oh)
And baby honestly it's harder breathing next to you, I shake
I brought a gun and as the preacher tried to stop me
Hold my heart it's beating for you anyway
[Chorus: Jeremy McKinnon & Vic Fuentes]
What if I can't forget you? (oh)
I'll burn your name into my throat
I'll be the fire that'll catch you
What's so good about picking up the pieces?
None of the colors ever light up anymore in this hole
Oh
[Verse 2: Vic Fuentes]
Nobody prays for the heartless (No!)
Nobody gives another penny for the selfish
(You're learning how to taste what you kill now)
Don't mind me, I'm just reaching for your necklace
Talking to my mom about this little girl from Texas
[Chorus: Jeremy McKinnon & Vic Fuentes]
What if I can't forget you? (oh)
I'll burn your name into my throat
I'll be the fire that'll catch you
What's so good about picking up the pieces?
None of the colors ever light up anymore in this hole
[Post-Chorus: Vic Fuentes & Jeremy McKinnon]
Just give her back to me
You know I can't afford the medicine that feeds what I need
So baby what if I can't forget you? (What if I can't forget you?)
Collide invisible lips like a shadow on the wall
And just throw, oh no
You can't just throw me away!
[Bridge: Vic Fuentes]
So what if I can't forget you?
I'll burn your name into my throat
I'll be the fire that'll catch you
What's so good about picking up the pieces?
What if I don't even want to
Oh, oh, oh...
[Chorus: Jeremy McKinnon & Vic Fuentes]
What if I can't forget you?
I'll burn your name into my throat
I'll be the fire that'll catch you
What's so good about picking up the pieces?
None of the colors ever light up anymore in this hole
[Post-Chorus: Vic Fuentes & Jeremy McKinnon]
Just give her back to me
You know I can't afford the medicine that feeds what I need
So baby what if I can't forget you? (What if I can't forget you?)
I'd better learn to live alone
[Outro: Vic Fuentes]
What's so good about picking up the pieces?
What's so good about
What's so good about
What's so good about picking up the pieces?
