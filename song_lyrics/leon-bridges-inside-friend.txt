[Intro: Leon Bridges & John Mayer]
You can be my inside friend
You can be my inside friend
[Verse 1: Leon Bridges]
Slide through when you want (Slide)
You know I want to put you on (Put you on)
It's evil out there (It's evil out there)
Let's keep it at home (Oh baby), so come on
I wanna see you slide across the kitchen floor (Slide across the kitchen floor)
Can't give you more but—
[Chorus: Leon Bridges & John Mayer]
You can be my inside friend
You can be my inside friend (Darlin' you)
My inside friend (Love right there)
Won't you be my inside friend? (You and you)
[Verse 2: Leon Bridges]
Come through with your hair still wet
Yoga pants, sweatshirt on the bed
Heart heavy and your week been crazy
We can be lazy, baby embrace me
And this feeling so right
Don't think about leaving anytime tonight
[Verse 3: John Mayer]
You can just slide across my kitchen floor
And tell me goodbye
And just see yourself right out my door
Come back through, when you want to
If you do
Or never call me anymore
That's what inside friends are for
[Chorus: Leon Bridges & John Mayer]
You can be my inside friend (Oh woah-woah, woah)
You can be my inside friend (Oh I wanna be)
My inside friend (Na, na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na)
Won't you be my inside friend? (Don't you wanna be? Don't you wanna be? Don't you wanna be my—)
