[Verse 1]
If I had no more time
No more time left to be here
Would you cherish what we had?
Was I everything that you were looking for?
If I couldn't feel your touch
And no longer were you with me
I'd be wishing you were here
To be everything that I've been looking for
[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna forget the present is a gift
And I don't wanna take for granted
Time you may have here with me
'Cause Lord only knows another day here's not really guaranteed
[Chorus]
So every time you hold me
Hold me like this is the last time
Every time you kiss me
Kiss me like you'll never see me again
Every time you touch me
Touch me like this is the last time
Promise that you'll love me
Love me like you'll never see me again
Oh oh oh
