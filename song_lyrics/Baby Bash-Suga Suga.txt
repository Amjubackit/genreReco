[Intro: Frankie J, 
Baby Bash
]
(
So
) So tight, so fly (
Mm
)
You got me lifted
You got me lifted
[Chorus: Frankie J]
You got me lifted, shifted higher than the ceilin'
And ooh-wee, it's the ultimate feelin'
You got me lifted, feeling so gifted
Sugar, how you get so fly?
Sugar, sugar, how you get so fly?
Sugar, sugar, how you get so fly?
Sugar, sugar, how you get so fly?
Sugar, sugar, how you get so fly?
[Post-Chorus: Baby Bash]
You know it's leather when we ride
Woodgrain and rawhide (Rawhide)
Doing what we do, watchin' screens gettin' high (High)
Girl, you keep it so fly, with your sweet honey buns (Buns)
You was there when the money was gone (Gone)
You'll be there when the money comes (Comes)
[Verse 1: Baby Bash]
Off top, I can't lie, I love to get blowed (Blowed)
You my little sugar, I'm your little chulo (Chulo)
And every time we kick it (Uh)
It's off to the groovy (Groove)
Treat you like my sticky icky
Or my sweet ooh-wee, gooey
 (Yeah, for real, though)
