[Chorus]
Follow me under and never to be too unique
Definitely a trap, she'll get ya body and you're starting to feel weak
Maybe a thing that you wanted is all that you need
Don't have to fill no expectation that aren't the thoughts that you conceive
[Bridge]
Promises, promises, promises left that you know
Changing with time
Promises, promises, promises left that you know
Changing with time
[Chorus]
Follow me under and never to be too unique
Definitely a trap, she'll get ya body and you're starting to feel weak
Maybe a thing that you wanted is all that you need
Don't have to fill no expectation that aren't the thoughts that you conceive
