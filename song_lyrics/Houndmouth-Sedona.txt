[Verse 1]
The red sandstone, it fell
Right smack on top
 of 
Sedona Arabelle
When 
John Ford said, "Won't you hop on in?"
And the Stagecoach
 baby gonna take you for a spin, oh whoa
Whoa whoa
[Chorus]
Well hey little Hollywood
You're gone but you're not forgot
You got the cash but your credit's no good
You flipped the script and you shot the plot
And I remember, I remember when the neon used to burn so bright and pink
Saturday night kind of pink
[Verse 2]
Well the blacklist and its hosts
He came down so swift
And you drove him to the coast
We're going California but we're all out of work
I guess that's better than a grave and a hearse, oh whoa
Whoa whoa
[Chorus]
Hey little Hollywood
You're gone but you're not forgot
You got the cash but your credit's no good
You flipped the script and you shot the plot
And I remember, I remember when the neon used to burn so bright and pink
Saturday night kind of pink
