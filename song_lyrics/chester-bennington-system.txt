[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
You fell away
What more can I say?
The feelings evolved
I won't let it out
I can't replace
Your screaming face
Feeling the sickness inside
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Why won't you die?
Your blood is mine
We'll be fine
Then your body will be mine
[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
So many words
Can't describe my fate
This feeling's evolved
So soon to break out
I can't relate
To a happy state
Feeling the blood run inside
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Why won't you die?
Your blood is mine
We'll be fine
Then your body will be mine
[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
Why is everything so fucking hard for me?
Keep me down to what you think I should be
Must you tempt me and provoke the ministry?
Keep on trying, Iâ€™m not dying so easily!
(I will not die!)
Why is everything so fucking hard for me?
(I will not die!)
Why is everything so fucking hard for me?
(I will not die!)
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Why won't you die?
Your blood is mine
We'll be fine
Then your body will be mine
Why won't you die?
Your blood is mine
We'll be fine
Then your body will be mine
