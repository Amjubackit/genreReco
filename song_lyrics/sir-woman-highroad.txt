[Verse 1]
I could write it off babe
You could make it all okay
I could say you're wrong
You could walk away
Was it something she said?
Maybe something he did
I could play along, look the other way
[Pre-Chorus]
If there's something baby
You should let 'em all know
It’s not giving in
When you're letting go
[Chorus]
If you’re thinking about taking the high road
I can tell you that you're doing it wrong
There’s a better way of letting it all go
Cause you’ve been running from the feeling too long
Way too long
[Verse 2]
Did you let it all go?
Should you let the girl know?
Did she do you wrong? Need a lighter load?
Were they holding you down?
Was he yelling too loud?
Did they break your heart bad? Got you acting proud?[Pre-Chorus]
If it's something baby
You should let 'em all know
It’s not giving in
When you're letting go
[Chorus]
If you’re thinking about taking the high road
I can tell you that you're doing it wrong
There’s a better way of letting it all go
Cause you’ve been running from this feeling too long, oh
So you want to paint a picture
Of every little thing that I did wrong
Now you're thinking about taking the high road
'Cause the road you're walking's taking too long
[Pre-Chorus]
It’s that simple, baby
You should let 'em all know
Its not giving in
When you're letting go
[Chorus]
If you’re thinking about taking the high road
I can tell you that you're doing it wrong
There’s a better way of letting it all go
'Cause you’ve been running from this feeling too long
So you want to paint a picture
Of every little thing that I did wrong
Now you're thinking that you might take the high road
'Cause the road you're walking taking too long
Ooh
