[Verse 1]
Where the train tracks meet
No defeat
She'll make this city complete
She'll tell you work hard, play hard
And release
Won't find her in the backseat
[Pre-Chorus]
Feisty, cool
Makes her own rules
She'll let you know
Oh, oh, oh
[Chorus]
She's gonna let her hair down
Ain't takin' it from no one
You're gonna lose your mind
When she dance, dance, dance, dance
She's gonna let her hair down
Ain't takin' it from no one
You're gonna lose your mind
When she dance, dance, dance, dance
[Post-Chorus]
Let your hair down
Let your hair down
Let your hair down
Let your hair down
[Verse 2]
Leave the old road behind
She ain't blind
She can't be undermined
She knows good from wrong
So strong
Hell, if she heard this song
[Pre-Chorus]
Feisty, cool
Makes her own rules
She'll let you know
Oh, oh, oh
[Chorus]
She's gonna let her hair down
Ain't takin' it from no one
You're gonna lose your mind
When she dance, dance, dance, dance
She's gonna let her hair down
Ain't takin' it from no one
You're gonna lose your mind
When she dance, dance, dance, dance
[Post-Chorus]
Let your hair down
Let your hair down
Let your hair down
[Bridge]
Work hard, I wanna play (Let your hair down)
I just wanna run away (Let your hair down)
Work hard, I wanna play (Let your hair down)
I just wanna run away (Let your hair down)
Work hard, I wanna play (Let your hair down)
I just, I'm running away
[Chorus]
She's gonna let her hair down
Ain't takin' it from no one
You're gonna lose your mind
When she dance, dance, dance, dance
She's gonna let her hair down
Ain't takin' it from no one
You're gonna lose your mind
When she dance, dance, dance, dance
She's gonna let her hair down
Ain't takin' it from no one
You're gonna lose your mind
When she dance, dance, dance, dance
She's gonna let her hair down
Ain't takin' it from no one
You're gonna lose your mind
When she dance, dance, dance, dance
