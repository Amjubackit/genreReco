Sitting in the park waiting for you
Yes I'm sitting right here
Waiting for you my dear
Wondering if you're ever gonna show up
I don't know if you're gonna show
My darling I've got to go
Nevertheless I say, you got me waiting
Sitting in the park waiting for you
Yes, I'm sitting on the bench
With my back against the fence
Wondering if I have any sense
Something tells me I'm a fool
To let you treat me so cruel
But nevertheless I say again, you got me waiting
Sitting in the park waiting for you
Why, oh why, oh why, oh why, oh why, oh why (tell me why)
Won't you tell me why (I don't know why)
Oh my darling I sit right down and pout, I wanna know why
Sitting in the park waiting for youYes, I'm sitting on the bench
With my back against the fence
Wondering if I have any sense
Something tells me I'm a fool
To let you treat me so cruel
But nevertheless I say again, you got me waiting
Sitting in the park waiting for you
