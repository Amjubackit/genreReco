[Intro]
(
T99, 少し強さを送ってくれ

Hol' up, hol' up
[Verse 1]
Marni bucket with the jacket to match
Askin' bitches "Where the chemistry at?"
C.O. trippin' when they visitin' max
Takin' guns, we ain't givin' it back
You ain't fuckin', no, return the gift back
I done told bitches, this ain't a finesse
Bro, you a killer, then say it with your chest
Bro get to clutchin', he trippin' off X
Bitch, you ain't nothin', ain't trippin' for sex
I was so deep and I came on her chest
Back-to-back sex, you know honey the best
I can not ever wear Carti's again
Count up a million, my hands was swole
Why you so cocky? Your friends is hoes
You got a Porsche, we ain't playin' with those
Bitch, I'm the reason the trеnches home
Shoot me a tеxt, ain't answer the phone
The two-hundred minutes ain't lastin' long
Hop in a group with the trenches phone
I'm tryna see what the trenches on
Got him a car again
I told him to spin and spin and spin again
That was an accident
You need your lash esthetician bitch to get in
I done move fast again
I done brought the car all cash, I need tints
He hit the perculator for the Percocets
These niggas ain't my friends
