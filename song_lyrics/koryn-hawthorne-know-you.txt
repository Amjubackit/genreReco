[Verse 1: Koryn Hawthorne]
I don't wanna live in the shallows
I was made to search the deep
If You're not in it, I don't want it
I want all of You, take all of me
[Chorus: Koryn Hawthorne & Steffany Gretzinger]
I wanna know You, really know You
I wanna know You, Lord
I wanna know You, long to show You
Nothing matters more
[Verse 2: Koryn Hawthorne]
Lead me Lord and I will follow
Bind my wandering heart to Thee
There's no life without You in it
I want all of You, take all of me
I want all of You, take all of me
[Chorus: Koryn Hawthorne & Steffany Gretzinger]
I wanna know You, really know You
I wanna know You, Lord
I wanna know You, long to show You
Nothing matters more
I wanna know You, really know You
I wanna know You, Lord
I wanna know You, long to show You
Nothing matters more[Bridge: Koryn Hawthorne, 
Koryn Hawthorne & Steffany Gretzinger
]
Anything else is empty
And everything else has an ending
Nobody else, nobody else satisfies
And anything else is empty
And everything else has an ending
Nobody else, nobody else satisfies
[Chorus: Koryn Hawthorne & Steffany Gretzinger]
I wanna know You, really know You
I wanna know You, Lord, hey
I wanna know You, long to show You
Nothing, nothing matters more
[Chorus: Koryn Hawthorne, 
Steffany Gretzinger
]
And anything else is empty (
I wanna know You
)
And everything else has an ending (
Really know You
)
Nobody else, nobody else (
I wanna know You, Lord
)
Nobody else, nobody else satisfies
(
I wanna know You
) Satisfies
(
Long to show You
)
(
Nothing matters more
)
[Outro: Koryn Hawthorne & Steffany Gretzinger, 
Koryn Hawthorne
]
I don't wanna live in the shallows
I was made to search the deep
If You're not in it, I don't want it
I want all of You, take all of me
I want all of You, take all of me
