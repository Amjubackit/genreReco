[Verse 1: Anthony Kiedis]
They come from every state to find
Some dreams were meant to be declined
Tell the man, what did you have in mind?
What have you come to do?
No turning water into wine
No learning while you're in the line
I'll take you to the broken sign
You see, these lights are blue
[Bridge 1: Anthony Kiedis]
Come and get it, lost it at the city limit
Say goodbye, 'cause they will find a way to trim it
Everybody lookin' for a silly gimmick
Gotta get away, can't take it for another minute
[Pre-Chorus 1: Anthony Kiedis]
This town is made of many things
Just look at what the current brings
So high, it's only promising
This place was made on you
[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis 
with John Frusciante
]
Tell me, baby, what's your story?
Where you come from and where you wanna go this time? Aw
Tell me, lover, are you lonely?
The thing we need is never all that hard to find, aw
Tell me, baby, what's your story?
Where do you come from and where you wanna go this time? Aw
You're so lovely, are you lonely?
Oh, giving up on the
 innocence you left behind
