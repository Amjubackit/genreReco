[Verse 1]
Drop stop and rolling baby
Knock knocking on your door
You're never home
Lock stock two loaded barrels
Said he heard ten to twelve
Fired into the living room
Hot box an old Mercedes
You always pass it to me
Though you know I never smoke
Feeling like a lot like it was lately
Lot going on not a lot coming in
That's how it goes
[Chorus]
Berry taught you how to rock 'n' roll
, uhuh
Molly taught you how to hit the floor
 uhuh
Muddy on the water
 on the 
Roxanne
Body hit the floor party's over uhuh
Drop stop and call your mama
You know she think about you when you're gone
Left your phone on the charger at home
Driving 'round till your song come on thе radio
[Verse 2]
We walked in like wе hit the lotto
Me from silicone
You a supermodel? Oh
Wonder what it's like to be a rockstar? Well
Chainsaw to the wall, Mr. Walsh
We need some room[Chorus]
Berry taught you how to rock 'n' roll, uhuh
Molly taught you how to hit the floor uhuh
Muddy on the water on the Roxanne
Body hit the floor party's over uhuh
[Bridge]
We walked in like we hit the lotto
You're in for it
You're in forever
You're in for it
You're in for it
[Chorus]
Berry taught you how to rock 'n' roll uhuh
Molly taught you how to hit the floor uhuh
Muddy on the water on the Roxanne
Body hit the floor party's over uhuh
