[Verse 1]
Unless you understand it, then find out what to do
Don't think about it, I'll be running with you
If I can't understand it, I'll find another way
Keep moving, keep moving
[Refrain]
Keep moving, keep moving
Keep moving, keep moving
[Verse 2]
Main avenue
If you're comin' like that, then it's really 'bout time, you know
In a new house, in a new place, if you change
Keep moving, keep moving
[Chorus]
I can hear the alarm
I won't take it much longer
(Keep moving, keep moving)
Ah, you're breaking my heart
Thanks for making me stronger
(Keep moving)
[Verse 3]
So you think you'll find the truth? If you change
When you're livin' like that, you could spin around town, you know
In a new house, in the UK
, if you change
Keep moving, keep moving
