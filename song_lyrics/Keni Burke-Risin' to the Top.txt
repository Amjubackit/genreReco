[Verse 1]
I know we're doing
Everything that we want to
Meanwhile, are we losing?
Because we won't let go
And yet we go
Let's start thinking what we're doing
Don't let nothing change your mind
Let's start heading homeward bound
Get off the ground
Stop losing, yeah losing
Keep risin' to the top
[Chorus]
(Give it all you got)
You gotta wake up your body
And wake up your body
And wake up your body
And move it around
Wake up your body
Wake up your body
Wake up your body and move it around
[Verse 2]
Keep on believing
All the dreams inside of you
And don't stop achieving yeah
Let some love shine on through
And don't fight the feeling
Just keep on dealing
Everybody, keep on moving
'Cause I know we can get it over, so baby
