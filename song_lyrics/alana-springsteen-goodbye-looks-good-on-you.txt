[Verse 1: Alana Springsteen]
I know the rules of a breakup
Delete your number and ruin your name
Baby we can make a mess and make up
Lie about it if I stay at your place
We could both be angry
Hate you and you hate me
We can play that game
And stay the same
[Chorus: Alana Springsteen & Mitchell Tenpenny]
But what if we don't have to choose?
What if no one has to lose?
I hope you meet somebody who
Loves you like I couldn't do
'Cause baby you and me were never right
We ain't gotta be on different sidеs
So what if we just told the truth
Yeah goodbyе looks good on you
And it looks good on me too
Oh-hoo, oh-hoo

We ain't gotta make a heartbreak harder
You ain't gotta make your mama hate me
I ain't gotta be a midtown martyr
I don't need a new girl to save me
We can still have the same friends 
(the same friends)
We can sit at the same bar 
(yeah, the same bar)
I just want you happy 
and hope you are[Chorus: Alana Springsteen & Mitchell Tenpenny]
But what if we don't have to choose?
What if no one has to lose?
I hope you meet somebody who
Loves you like I couldn't do
'Cause baby you and me were never right
We ain't gotta be on different sides
So what if we just told the truth
Yeah goodbye looks good on you
And it looks good on me too
Oh-hoo, oh-hoo
Oh-hoo, oh-hoo
Goodbye, goodbye

We could both be angry

Hate you when you hate me

We could play that game
But not today

Yeah goodbye looks good on you
And it looks good on me too
Oh-hoo, oh-hoo
And it looks good on me too
Oh-hoo, oh-hoo
And it looks good on me too
