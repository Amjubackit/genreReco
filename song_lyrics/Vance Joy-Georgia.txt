[Verse 1]
She is something to behold
Elegant and bold
She is electricity
Running to my soul, oh
[Chorus]
And I could easily lose my mind
The way you kiss me will work each time
Calling me to come back to bed
Singing "Georgia On My Mind"
[Post-Chorus]
And I
And I
[Verse 2]
Lips generous and warm
You build me up like steps
Eyes innocent and wild
Remind me what it's like, oh
[Chorus]
And I could easily lose my mind
The way you kiss me will work each time
Pulling me back into the flames
And I'm burning up again, I'm burning up
