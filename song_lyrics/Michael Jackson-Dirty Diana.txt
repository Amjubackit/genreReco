[Verse 1]
You'll never make me stay
So take your weight off of me
I know your every move
So won't you just let me be?
I've been here times before
But I was too blind to see
That you seduce every man
This time, you won't seduce me
[Pre-Chorus]
She's saying "That's okay
Hey baby, do what you please
I have the stuff that you want
I am the thing that you need"
She looked me deep in the eyes
She's touching me so to start
She says "There's no turning back"
She trapped me in her heart
[Chorus]
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, let me be!
Oh no, oh no, oh no
