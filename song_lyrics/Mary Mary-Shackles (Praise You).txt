[Intro: Warryn Campbell]
Whew, it sure is hot out here, you know
I don't mind, though
I'm just glad to be free, you know what I'm saying?
Uh
[Chorus: Mary Mary & 
Warryn Campbell
]
Take the shackles off my feet so I can dance
I just wanna praise You 
(What you wanna do?)
I just wanna praise You 
(Yeah, yeah)
You broke the chains now I can lift my hands 
(Feel me?)
And I'm gonna praise You 
(What you gon' do?)
I'm gonna praise You
[Verse 1: Erica]
In the corners of my mind, I just can't seem to find
A reason to believe that I can break free
'Cause you see, I have been
Down for so long, feel like all hope was gone
But as I lift my hands, I understand
That I should praise You through my circumstance
[Chorus: Mary Mary]
Take the shackles off my feet so I can dance (So I can dance)
I just wanna praise You (Just wanna praise You)
I just wanna praise You (Just wanna praise You)
You broke the chains now I can lift my hands (I can lift my hands)
And I'm gonna praise You
I'm gonna praise You
