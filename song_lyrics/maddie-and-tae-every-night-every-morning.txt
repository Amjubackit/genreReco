[Verse 1]
He said, "Baby how was your day?
Did you call your momma, is she okay?
Are you thinking whiskey or Cabernet?
Let me get it, let's get drunk on a weekday"
He said, "I know I don't say it enough
But I swear I love you ain't just from the buzz"
He said, "I don't know what I'd do
If I didn't have you"
I said, "I think about that too"
[Chorus]
Every night and every morning
I fall all over again and again
And you don't even know it
Baby if you're wondering when you hold me
If I still feel forever, only
Every night and every morning
[Verse 2]
I can see us in fifty years
Rocking pointed west, rocking chairs
'Cause baby some love never fades
And somе things never change
[Chorus]
Evеry night and every morning
I fall all over again and again
And you don't even know it
Baby if you're wondering when you hold me
If I still feel forever, only
Every night and every morning[Bridge]
He said, "I know I don't say it enough
But I swear I love you ain't just from the buzz"
He said, "I don't know what I'd do
If I didn't have you"
If I didn't have you
[Chorus]
Every night and every morning
I fall all over again and again
And you don't even know it
Baby if you're wondering when you hold me
If I still feel forever, only
Every night and every morning
[Outro]
Every night and every morning
Every night, every morning
Baby yeah
