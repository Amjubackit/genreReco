[Verse]
We love to call Your name
It's something we cannot explain
That happens when we proclaim
Your great name, Your great name
We love to call Your name
It's something we cannot explain
That happens when we proclaim
Your great name, Your great name!
[Chorus]
King Jesus, no other name
King Jesus, none stronger
We call on You, things change, yes
When we call on Your name
[Verse]
We love to call Your name
It's something we cannot explain
That happens when we proclaim
Your great name, Your great name!
[Chorus]
King Jesus, no other name
King Jesus, none stronger
We call on You, things change, yes
When we call on Your name
King Jesus, no other name
King Jesus, none stronger
We call on You, things change, yes
When we call on Your name
