[Intro: AURORA]
Bring back the color
[Verse 1: AURORA]
Rose, light on her toes
Dancing in heels, her eyes on me
Rose already knows
That she's a dangerous maker of beauty
[Refrain: AURORA]
Chimney of the core, will you open for
Somebody who waits for time?
Speaking rhymes
Dream, sing, wild
[Chorus: AURORA]
Would I carry back the sun, carry back the sun
And beg for the mother to bring back the color?
Everyone I know and everyone I love
I beg for a lover to bring back the color
[Drop: AURORA]
Bring back the color
[Verse 2: AURORA]
Stone sinks to the floor
And never returns back to before
The stone already knows
That it can crush all that has grown
[Refrain: AURORA]
Chimney of the core, will you open for
Somebody who waits for growth? (Inhale)
Hides below (Exhale)
A fading glow (Inhale)
[Chorus: AURORA]
Would I carry back the sun, carry back the sun
And beg for the mother to bring back the color?
Everyone I know and everyone I love
I beg for a lover to bring back the color
[Drop: AURORA]
Bring back the color
Would I carry back the sun, carry back the sun
And beg for the mother to bring back the color?
Everyone I know and everyone I love
I beg for a lover to bring back the color
[Outro: AURORA]
Oh, to bring back the color
