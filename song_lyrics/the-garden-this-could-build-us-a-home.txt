Cell Door Slams
Right Into My Face
Layin' Em' On
Jack Shit Surrounding My Barn
I've gotta beat time
I've gotta beat time
Running out of time
Running out of time
I've gotta beat time
I've gotta beat time
Running out of time
Running out of time
Promise me
That this can build a home
Promise me
That we will not get old
I've gotta beat time
I've gotta beat time
Running out of time
Running out of time
I've gotta beat time
I've gotta beat time
Running out of time
Running out of time
I've gotta beat time
I've gotta beat time
Running out of time
Running out of time
