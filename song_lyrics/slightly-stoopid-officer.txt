[Verse 1: Miles and Kyle]
It all started late on a Saturday night
Said who's got the spliffs and who's got the pint?
Look out the window, said, to my surprise
Here comes the man in blue and his flashing lights
He said now, "You know your party's fuckin' over with
Because you're smokin' joints and you're rolling spliffs
And tell me, what ya think I oughta think of this?
So, won't ya pull out your sack or, said, a you will be missed"
[Chorus: Miles]
Say now, Mr. Officer, come charge me all the time
You got me for possession, but, I swear, that is not mine
No matter what you do or say
It's bound to come right back this way
And if you want a moment's peace, said
This what you'll say, c'mon and
Let's get this party started
Until the break of dawn, and
Let's keep this party movin'
Until there's no one home, and
Let's get this party started
Until the break of dawn, and
Let's keep this party movin'
All you got to do is sing
[Chorus: Kyle]
Can't take the pressure for long
All they wanna do is rock till after 2:00
Getting high, then they singing a song
Nab another b and drink another brew
Said, they can't take the pressure for long
All they wanna do is rock till after 2:00
Getting high, then they singing a song
Nab another b and drink another brew
Come on
[Verse 2: Miles and Kyle]
But-a won't ya roadblock, but-a me so sorry, Mr. Cop
I bet you anything me gonna get stopped
But-a won't ya roadblock, but-a me so sorry, Mr. Cop
I bet you anything me gonna get a stopped, won't ya?
Hey, mister copper, said now, why you stop-a me?
No-no, I wasn't driving me car badly
I said, don't go lock me up because me smoke sensi
Yes, this is the ghetto, but me live 'cross the sea
[Chorus: Miles]
Say now, Mr. Officer, come charge me all the time
You got me for possession, but, I swear, that is not mine
No matter what you do or say
It's bound to come right back this way
And if you want a moment's peace, said
This what you'll say, c'mon and
Let's get this party started
Until the break of dawn, and
Let's keep this party movin'
Until there's no one home, and
Let's get this party started
Until the break of dawn, and
Let's keep this party movin'
All you got to do is sing
[Chorus: Kyle]
Can't take the pressure for long
All they wanna do is rock till after 2:00
Getting high, then they singing a song
Nab another b and drink another brew
Said, they can't take the pressure for long
All they wanna do is rock till after 2:00
Getting high, then they singing a song
Nab another b and drink another brew
Come on
