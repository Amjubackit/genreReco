[Chorus]
Darlin', what you waitin' there for?
I got you alone, but I don’t wanna go
And darlin', what you waitin' there for?
I got you alone, but I don’t really know
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
[Verse]
I will try to leave you alone
And I will try to leave you alone
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
[Chorus]
Darlin', what you waitin' there for?
I got you alone, but I don’t wanna go
Darlin', what you waitin' there for?
I got you alone, but I don’t really know
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Verse]
I will try to leave you alone
And I will try to leave you alone
I will try to leave you alone
(Darlin', what you waitin' there for?)
(I got you alone, but I don’t really know)
And I will try to leave you alone
(Darlin', what you waitin' there for?)
(I got you alone, but I don’t really know)
I will try to leave you alone
(Darlin', what you waitin' there for?)
(I got you alone, but I don’t really know)
And I will try to leave you alone
(Darlin', what you waitin' there for?)
(I got you alone, but I don’t really know)
