[Chorus]
I’ll be here awhile, ain’t going nowhere
I’ll be here awhile, ain’t going nowhere
I’ll be here awhile, ain’t going nowhere
I’ll be here awhile
[Verse 1]
Far is solace in the maddening pace
Sad state written on my face
Not a tight rope walk but dance
Uncertain game of chance
But I’ll see it through in time
[Chorus]
I’ll be here awhile, ain’t going nowhere
I’ll be here awhile, ain’t going nowhere
I’ll be here awhile, ain’t going nowhere
I’ll be here awhile
[Verse 2]
And if a person, place, or thing can delive I would quiver with delight
Tempted by the hand that could blind my vision and sight
But at twenty years of age
In frolic and in rage
I will see it through in time
