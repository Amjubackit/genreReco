[Verse 1]
Those eyes, disguise, I'll hide
Bright lights, design, they're fine
Your heart beats fast despite
The truth that love is blind
[Chorus]
I just wanna feel anything
Anything with you, with you
I just wanna feel anything
Anything with you, with you
[Verse 2]
This time, don't say goodbye
Don't know if I can lie
My heart beats fast, alright
Come home with me tonight
[Chorus]
I just wanna feel anything
Anything with you, with you
I just wanna feel anything
Anything with you, with you
[Bridge]
I just wanna feel, feel anything, yeah
I just wanna feel anything
I just wanna feel, feel anything, yeah
I just wanna feel anything
I just wanna—
I just wanna—
I just wanna—
I just wanna—
I just wanna—
I just wanna—
I just wanna—
I just wanna—[Chorus]
I just wanna feel anything
Anything with you, with you
I just wanna feel anything
Anything with you, with you
