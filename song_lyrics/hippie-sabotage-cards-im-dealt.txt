[Chorus]
Can't' you tell that I'm not well
I can't even stand myself
Need to snap out of this spell
Another day inside this hell
Always walking on egg shells
I guess that's the cards I'm dealt
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
[Verse]
Say fuck that shit
I want a new life new big ass crip
Just a little something for everything I did
Lord knows that I got nothing left to give
And I know some day I might feel different
And i know that there roads always interesting
But I know what it takes I ain't ignorant
So I pray that someone's really listening
[Chorus]
Cause can't' you tell that I'm not well
I can't even stand myself
Need to snap out of this spell
Another day inside this hell
Always walking on egg shells
I guess that's the cards I'm dealtOh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
[Outro]
That's the cards I'm dealt
That's the cards I'm dealt
That's the cards I'm dealt
That's the cards I'm dealt
