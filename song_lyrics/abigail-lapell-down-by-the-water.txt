[Verse 1]
Where will you go my darling daughter
I'm gonna live down by the water
If I ever could find the time
Never no reason or rhyme
I'm gonna live down by the water
[Verse 2]
And I'm gonna send a dozen roses
Down the river like baby Moses
And I'll wash my tears away
When I'm down in the river today
Gonna send a dozen roses, a dozen roses
[Verse 3]
And who will be your one and only
When the days are lost and lonely
And the little blue birds of spring
Go down to the river to sing
Who will their testimony?
[Verse 4]
Sing a little song darling
Sing it like a little blue starling
In the country or the town
And for miles all around
Sing a little song darling[Verse 5]
Now the days are getting hotter
I'm gonna live down by the water
If I ever could find the time
Never no reason or rhyme
I'm gonna live down by the water
[Outro]
Down by the water, down by the water
Gonna live down by the water
Down by the water, gonna live down by the water
