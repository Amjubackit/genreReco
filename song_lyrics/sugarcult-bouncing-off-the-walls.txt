[Chorus]
I'm bouncing off the walls again (whoa, oh)
I'm looking like a fool again (whoa, oh)
I threw away my reputation
One more song for the radio station
[Post-Chorus]
I'm bouncing off the walls again (whoa, oh)
I'm looking like a fool again (whoa, oh)
Waking up on the bathroom floor
Pull myself back together just to fall once more
[Verse 1]
And my heart's beating out of my chest
And this town is still making me sick
And every penny from my last paycheck
I've blown it on you
[Chorus]
I'm bouncing off the walls again (whoa, oh)
And I'm looking like a fool again (whoa, oh)
So go ahead and take a picture
And hang it up so you can tear me down
[Verse 2]
I don't care
'Cause I'm still here
And I've got nothing left to lose
With all the years I wasted on you[Bridge]
Momma and Daddy's got the best cocaine
Ritalin's never gonna feel the same
Twenty-four hours on an empty brain
I got my finger on the trigger and you're in my way
[Chorus]
I'm bouncing off the walls again (whoa oh)
And I'm looking like a fool again (whoa oh)
I threw away my reputation
One more song for the radio station
[Outro]
I'm bouncing off the walls again
And I'm looking like a fool again
I'm bouncing off the walls again
And I'm looking like a fool again
I'm bouncing off the walls again
