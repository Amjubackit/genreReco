Hey little girl, is your daddy home?
Will he go away and leave you all alone?
I got a bad desire
Oh, oh, oh, I'm on fire
Tell me now baby, is he good to you?
Does he do to you the things that I do?
Oh no, I can take you higher
Oh, oh, oh, I'm on fire
Sometimes it's like someone took a knife, baby, edgy and dull
And cut a six-inch valley through the middle of my soul
At night I wake up with the sheets soaking wet
And a freight train running through the middle of my head
Only you can cool my desire
Oh, oh, oh, I'm on fire
