[Verse 1]
What a day to meet the master
I've been waiting for so long
Final day to meet the master
It's my time to go home
[Chorus]
And I'm taken, woah
By the madness
And the tripping
And the touching
[Verse 2]
What a day to travel faster
Take my trip around the sun
I have known no other master
He has been the only one
[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, he was the only one
Ooh, the only one
[Chorus]
And I'm taken
By the madness
And the tripping
And the touching
