I don't wanna waste my time
And I don't wanna lose sight of where I've been
And I just wanna get so high
And I don't wanna ever come down again
And the day goes so fast
And the night feels so long
I just wanna get so high
I will carry you to the other side
To another place, to another life
I'll be there for you, every day and night
Gonna bring you right back to the way of life
Maybe it won't feel the same
When you find what you're looking for
And even if the world don't change
But we keep coming back for more
So give me a sign
And show me the light
I just wanna get so high
I will carry you to the other side
To another place, to another life
I'll be there for you, every day and night
Gonna bring you right back to the way of lifeThe rhythm of our hearts will soon beat in time
Cause anything that's lost you know we soon will find
Even if the time it won't wait for you
Listen to your heart and watch your dreams come true
We gonna find the way to find a brighter day
Today is where it's gonna start
We don't care about the thing they do or say
Even when the world is falling apart
We won't waste time, do what ya need to do
Listen to the rhythm of your heart
You know the things I do, you know I do it for you, yeah
I will carry you to the other side
To another place, to another life
I'll be there for you, every day and night
Gonna bring you right back to the way of life
It's the way of life
Today is where it's gonna start
It's the way of life
Even when the world is falling apart
It's the way of life
Listen to the rhythm of our hearts
It's the way of life
Do you think about the other man
Do you got some better plans
Couldn't see the storm even predicted by the weatherman
Going to a better place, taking it to another land
Trying to keep the world inside the palm and not an empty hand
Do you think about the other man
Do you got some better plans
Couldn't see the storm even predicted by the weatherman
Going to a better place, taking it to another land
Trying to keep the world inside the palm and not an empty hand
