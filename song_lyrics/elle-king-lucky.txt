[Verse 1]
I've been a runner, I've been a fighter
I've been the fuse, hell, I've been the lighter
Taken every wrong turn down the bridges I burned
It's a bad reputation, but it's damn well earned
[Pre-Chorus]
Gotta thank God that this ole life ain't fair
There's only one way to explain how I got here
[Chorus]
I got lucky
Well, ain't that somethin' for someone just like me
Who don't deserve a damn thing?
I know broken, beat down
And I know I show it then and now
But, hell, I chosе it, yeah, I own it
And it brings me to my knees
I got lucky
[Verse 2]
I've been it all, I'vе been empty
I've had nothin', I've had plenty
Yeah, I've done the dance, too many close calls
More than most, most of all
[Chorus]
I got lucky
Ain't that somethin' for someone just like me
Who don't deserve a damn thing?
I know broken, beat down
I know I show it then and now
But, hell, I chose it, yeah, I own it
And it brings me to my knees
I got lucky
[Bridge]
I make sure I don't make it on easy on me
But I woke up today, so that must mean
[Chorus]
I got lucky
Well, ain't that somethin' for someone just like me
Who don't deserve one damn thing?
I know broken, beat down
And I know I show it then and now
Hell, I chose it, yeah, I own it
And it brings me to my knees
I got lucky
I got lucky
Oh
[Spoken Outro]
I'm your mom
