[Verse 1]
You're the soul who understands
The scars that made me who I am
Through the drifting sands of time
I got your back and you got mine
[Pre-Chorus 1]
If you bear a heavy load
I'll be your wheels, I'll be the road
I'll see us through the thick and thin
For love and loss until the end
[Chorus]
'Cause you carried me with you
From the highest of the peaks
To the darkness of the blue
I was just too blind to see
Like a lighthouse in a storm
You were always guiding me
Yeah, it's true
You carried me with you
[Verse 2]
From the day it all began
Yeah, you were there, you took my hand
And when I hurt a bit too deep
You watched me as I fell asleep
