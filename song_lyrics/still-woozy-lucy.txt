[Verse 1: Still Woozy & ODIE]
Oh, you for the whole last week
Have been laughin', cussin' and yelling in your sleep (Why?)
I think it through
What the hell you watching, boo?
Is there something supernatural fucking with you? (Really though)
[Chorus: Still Woozy]
Well I know that it's only time
But let me see what's on your mind
I could see what's on your mind
What's on your mind?
Why are you so damn cute?
Make a fool of me, I won't die
Why?
What's on your mind? What's on your mind?
[Bridge: ODIE & Still Woozy]
(You see my love, wish it don't break
Wish it don't break)
Safe is your heart, lover
You know we should start
Learn to be open, be open
Safe is your heart, lover
Safe is your love
You know we should start
Learn to be open, be open
[Verse 2: ODIE & Still Woozy]
She could paint the sky like a photo, yeah
And baby we should never know it
If we don't, if we won't try
We could live a life full of color
If you want (If you want)
Let me know
We'll escape the pigeon hole (pigeon hole)
It's our world, so go, girl
Let's get it on
[Chorus: Still Woozy]
Well I know that it's only time
But let me see what's on your mind
I could see what's on your mind
What's on your mind?
Why are you so damn cute?
Make a fool of me, I won't die
Why?
What's on your mind? What's on your mind?
