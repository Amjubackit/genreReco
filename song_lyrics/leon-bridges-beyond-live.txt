[Verse 1: Leon Bridges, Luke Combs, Leon Bridges & Luke Combs]
Don't wanna get ahead of myself
Feeling things I've never felt
It's kind of hard for me to explain
Her personality and everything
Brings me to my knees, oh
She shines me up like gold on my arm
I wanna take it slow but it's so hard
I love to see her face in daylight
It's more than just our bodies at night
But she's really tempting me, oh
Do you think I'm being foolish if I don't rush in?
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
[Chorus: Leon Bridges & Luke Combs, Luke Combs]
I'm scared to death that she might be it
That the love is real, that the shoe might fit
She might just be my everything and beyond, beyond
Space and time in the afterlife
Will she have my kids? Will she be my wife?
She might just be my everything and beyond
[Verse 2: Leon Bridges, Luke Combs, Leon Bridges & Luke Combs]
I wanna bring her 'round to meet ya
I think you'd like her kind demeanor
I know that grandma would've loved her
Like she was her own
She makes me feel at home, oh (Yeah)
Do you think I'm being foolish if I don't rush in?
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
[Chorus: Leon Bridges & Luke Combs, Luke Combs]
I'm scared to death that she might be it
That the love is real, that the shoe might fit
She might just be my everything and beyond, beyond
Space and time in the afterlife
Will she have my kids? Will she be my wife?
She might just be my everything and beyond
[Bridge: Luke Combs, Luke Combs & Leon Bridges, Leon Bridges]
I give up, I'm in love crying
Out to you
Oh me, oh my I can't explain
She might just be my everything
Oh me, oh my I can't explain
She might just be my everything
Oh me, oh my I can't explain
She might just be my everything
So do you think I'm being foolish if I don't rush in?
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
[Chorus: Leon Bridges & Luke Combs]
I'm scared to death that she might be it
That the love is real, that the shoe might fit
She might just be my everything and beyond, beyond
Space and time in the afterlife
Will she have my kids? Will she be my wife?
She might just be my everything and beyond
[Outro: Luke Combs & Leon Bridges, Leon Bridges]
(She might just be mine) Oh me, oh my, I can't explain
(She might just be mine) She might just be my everything
(She might just be mine) Oh me, oh my, I can't explain
(She might just be mine) She might just be my everything
(She might just be mine) Oh me, oh my, I can't explain
(She might just be mine) She might just be my everything
(She might just be mine) I know that she might be, be mine
