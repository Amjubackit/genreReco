Devil behind you, run run away
But you got to turn and fight, to live another day
Whisper in the saw grass, murmur in the pines
Lift your hands up and away, lift them off your eyes
Playing hide and seek, but my eyes are wide open
Playing hide and seek, but my eyes are wide open
A voice says you're right, another says you're wrong
Well who speaks and who listens the weak or the strong
Can you feel the fear, deep within the mind
There's no loss or gain in soul
Nothing real can ever die or feel it
Playing hide and seek, but my eyes are wide open
Playing hide and seek, but my eyes are wide open
Standing by the VJ, I can hear them sing
That the truth it must be lived
And to wake up from the dream of madness
Playing hide and seek, but my eyes are wide open
Playing hide and seek, but my eyes are wide open
Playing hide and seek, but our eyes are wide open
Playing hide and seek, but our eyes are wide open
Playing hide and seek, but our eyes are wide open yeah
