[Intro]
Baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Hey baby
[Verse 1]
Yeah, when I first saw that bikini top on her
Sheâ€™s poppin' right out of the South Georgia water
Thought, "Oh, good lord, she had them long tanned legs"
Couldn't help myself, so I walked up and said
[Chorus]
Baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowin' stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
Would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it
So baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
[Verse 2]
She was sippin' on Southern and singin' Marshall Tucker
We were fallin' in love in the sweet heart of summer
She hopped right up into the cab of my truck and said
"Fire it up, let's go get this thing stuck"
