[Verse 1]
Home grown alligator, see you later
Gotta hit the road, gotta hit the road
Something changed in the atmosphere
Architecture unfamiliar
I could get used to this
[Pre-Chorus]
Time flies by in the yellow and green
Stick around and you'll see what I mean
There's a mountain-top that I'm dreamin' of
If you need me you know where I'll be
[Chorus]
I'll be ridin' shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feelin' like a someone
I'll be ridin' shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feelin' like a someone
[Verse 2]
South of the Equator, navigator
Gotta hit the road, gotta hit the road
Deep sea divin' 'round the clock
Bikini bottoms, lager tops
I could get used to this
