[Verse 1]
Just talk yourself up and tear yourself down
You've hit your one wall, now find a way around
Well, what's the problem? You got a lot of nerve
[Pre-Chorus]
So what did you think I would say?
No, you can't run away
No, you can't run away
So what did you think I would say?
No, you can't run away
No, you can't run away
You wouldn't
[Chorus]
I never wanted to say this
You never wanted to stay
I put my faith in you, so much faith
And then you just threw it away
You threw it away
[Verse 2]
I'm not so naive, my sorry eyes can see
The way you fight shy of almost everything
Well, if you give up, you'll get what you deserve[Pre-Chorus]
So what did you think I would say?
No, you can't run away
No, you can't run away
So what did you think I would say?
No, you can't run away
No, you can't run away
You wouldn't
[Chorus]
I never wanted to say this
You never wanted to stay
I put my faith in you, so much faith
And then you just threw it away
You threw it away
[Bridge]
You were finished long before
We had even seen the start
Why don't you stand up? Be a man about it
Fight with your bare hands about it now
[Chorus]
I never wanted to say this (Say this)
You never wanted to stay, well, did you?
I put my faith in you, so much faith
And then you just threw it away
I never wanted to say this
You never wanted to stay
And I put my faith in you, so much faith
And then you just threw it away
