[Chorus 1]
And I'm thinkin' about my doorbell
When you gonna ring it, and when you gonna ring it
Yeah, I'm thinkin' about my doorbell
When you gonna ring it, when you gonna ring it
Yeah, I'm thinkin' about my doorbell
When you gonna ring it, when you gonna ring it
Yeah, I been thinkin' about my doorbell
Oh, well
[Verse 1]
Well, women and children need kisses
Not the man in my life I know
And I been goin' to mystery misses
I respect the art of the show
Take back what you said, little girl
And while you're at it take yourself back too
Well, I'm tired of sitting here waiting
Woman, what you going to do now, what you going to do about it?
[Chorus 1]
And I'm thinkin' about my doorbell
When you gonna ring it, and when you gonna ring it
Yeah, I'm thinkin' about my doorbell
When you gonna ring it, yeah, when you gonna ring it, oh
I'm thinkin' about my doorbell
When you gonna ring it, and when you gonna ring it
Yeah, I been thinkin' about my doorbell
Oh, well
