[Verse 1]
It's hard to see a type of girl like me
The stars truly, they want me to succeed
They doubt, they sleep, they keep on telling me
I ain’t going nowhere
Baby wait 'til you see my name everywhere
[Refrain]
When I'm on tour, I’ll let you know
And what's in store, I'll let you know
And when I'm on, they'll let you know
They'll sing my songs and they gon' dance along
[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh
Look at me go
Ooh, ooh
I got the groo-oove
Ooh, ooh
Look at me work
Ooh, ooh
I got the groo-oove
[Chorus]
I'll take my chances on the road
I’ll take my chances on the road
I’ll take my chances on the road
I'll take my chances on the road
[Verse 2]
Don’t let them slow you
You know you're getting closer
You're bound to be golden
Keep on doin' what you do
Life opens doors, and can’t nobody close them
Learn from every moment
Baby you can push through
[Refrain]
When you're on tour, you let them know
And what's in store, you let them know
And when you're on they let you know
They'll sing your songs and they gon' dance along
[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh
Look at you go
Ooh, ooh
You got the groo-oove
Ooh, ooh
Look at you work
Ooh, ooh
You got the groo-oove
[Chorus]
I'll take my chances on the road
I'll take my chances on the road
I'll take my chances on the road
I'll take my chances on the road
[Outro]
Take my, take my chances
Take my, take my chances
Take my, take my chances
Take my, take my chances
Take my, take my chances
Take my, take my chances
Take my, take my chances
(Take)
(Yeah)
