[Verse 1]
It's hard to see a type of girl like me
The stars truly, they want me to succeed
They doubt, they sleep, they keep on telling me
I ain’t going nowhere
Baby wait 'til you see my name everywhere
[Refrain]
When I'm on tour, I’ll let you know
And what's in store, I'll let you know
And when I'm on, they'll let you know
They'll sing my songs and they gon' dance along
[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh
Look at me go
Ooh, ooh
I got the groo-oove
Ooh, ooh
Look at me work
Ooh, ooh
I got the groo-oove
[Chorus]
I'll take my chances on the road
I’ll take my chances on the road
I’ll take my chances on the road
I'll take my chances on the road
