[Chorus]
Our Father
All of Heaven roars Your name
Sing louder
Let this place erupt with praise
Can you hear it
A sound of Heaven touching earth
A sound of Heaven touching earth
Our Father
All of Heaven roars Your name
Sing louder
Let this place erupt with praise
Can you hear it
A sound of Heaven touching earth
The sound of Heaven touching earth
Our Father
All of Heaven roars Your name
Sing louder
Let this place erupt with praise
Can you hear it
A sound of Heaven touching earth
A sound of Heaven touching earth
A sound of Heaven touching earth
Our Father
All of Heaven roars Your name
Sing louder
Let this place erupt with praise
Can you hear it
A sound of Heaven touching earth
The sound of Heaven touching earth
A sound of Heaven touching earth
