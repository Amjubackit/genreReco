[Verse 1]
The enemy came up against your home
The enemy came up against your children
The enemy came up against your name
The enemy came up against your character
[Chorus]
(Despite it, what it looks like)
You will win, win
You will win, win
[Verse 2]
The enemy came up against your health
The enemy came up against your finance (your finance)
The enemy came up against your vision
The enemy came up against your business
[Chorus]
(Despite it, what it looks like)
You will win, win
You will win, win
You will win, win
You will win, win
I know you're hurt
I know you're torn
I know you're broken but
You will win
All of those may be facts
But the truth still remains
That in the name of Jesus
You will win![Refrain]
It's my winning season
It's my winning season
It's my winning season
(It's my winning season)

[Interlude]
[Spoken]
The Lord told me
He said, anybody can fight
But the question is: can you win?
I came to tell somebody up in here tonight
That there's something on the inside of you
That's gonna help you win in this season
And it's [?], the champion
You gotta open up your mouth
And shout, "I am a champion"
Everything attached to you wins
(Everything attached to me wins)
I said everything attached to you wins
(Everything attached to me wins)
Can you point to your neighbor and say:
Everything attached to you wins
(Everything attached to me wins)
Everything attached to you wins
(Everything attached to me wins)[Refrain]
It's your winning season
It's your winning season
It's your winning season
It's your winning season
It's your winning season
It's your winning season
It's your winning season
It's your winning season
Everything attached to me wins
[Interlude]
[Refrain]
