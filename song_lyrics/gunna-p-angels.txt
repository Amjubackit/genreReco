[Chorus]
I'm in Sky-ami, I'm back out the chain (Yeah)
Took a few losses, that's part of the game (That's part of the game)
Bought a big jet, took my talents to Spain (Yeah)
I had to swerve, they was all in my lane (Skrrt)
On a Tsunami, yeah, like wave
I bought the map (Uh), Bruce Wayne (Wayne)
Sleep on the yacht for like twenty-somethin' days
On a G6 tryna smoke all the Haze (Smoke all the Haze)
[Verse 1]
I got P angels, they pullin' up whisperin' (P's)
Breakin' out sentences, and geekin' and trippin'
I'm with the bad ones, the one that be trippin' (The bad ones)
Y'all niggas laughin', we laughin' right with you (Ha)
Only thing that matter is bigger picture
Don't you get mad, try send one your hitters (Send one your hitters)
I know he mad he found out that I hit her
Couple more baddies, let's order more liquor
Kicking my P, let these boys talk in pillows (Yeah)
All in they mouth, I'm the motherfuckin' dinner (Motherfuckin' dinner)
Come to my crib, you gon' need some credentials (Come on)
Two or three gates pullin' up, ain't that simple (Nah)
Factory AP, yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
I do business with the original dealer (Original dealer)
Handle business, get on top of you niggas (On top of you niggas)
Oh, Lord, forgive me, you know I'm a sinner (Yeah)
The drip when I walk I'm a oil spiller (Oil spiller)
I mixed the Marni with Margiela (Margiela)
Do my big one like Godzilla (Godzilla)
Caramel and redbone and some of them yellow (Some of them yellow)
Had to whip out the card (Card)
Keep the black card like a car dealer (Dealer)
Push P like park (Ms. Park)
Go back up to space out of Dodge (Yeah)[Chorus]
I'm in Sky-ami, I'm back out the chain (Yeah)
Took a few losses, that's part of the game (That's part of the game)
Bought a big jet, took my talents to Spain (Yeah)
I had to swerve, they was all in my lane (Skrrt)
On a Tsunami, yeah, like wave
I bought the map (Uh), Bruce Wayne (Wayne)
Sleep on the yacht for like twenty-somethin' days
On a G6 tryna smoke all the Haze (Smoke all the Haze)
[Verse 2]
I fuck some baddies four hours straight (Yeah)
Pill came from Porn Hub, we fucked out the gate (Yeah)
Head to plantation, a millionaire estate (Millionaire estate)
Geeked like the station back in the day (Geeked)
I'm staying focused, get paid (Get paid)
I bought a Lotus, Wale (Wale)
Ain't givin' warnings, clear the way (Clear the way)
Paint all my watches same color of spade (Yeah)
Peace to Wunna, she don't wanna get saved
Nigga can't count how much money I made
Flew to the Yams, I got tired of the shade (Gone)
I can't see nothin' in these new Prada shades (New Prada shades)
I'll send the cleaners I keep me a maid
I'm from the hood, still'll catch me and fade (Catch me and fade, fade)
What's crackin', lil nigga? Let's get us a fake
Fuck all that bullshit, I went back to get it
I land in Sky-ami, been a minute
I'm gon' get a GRAMMY, that's my witness
I want it, I get it independent
Took up some L's, still winnin'
Roll up an L, I'm so high, I see the city
I locked her in 'cause she freaky and saditty
Pop back right out and I'm showin' up petty[Chorus]
I'm in Sky-ami, I'm back out the chain (Yeah)
Took a few losses, that's part of the game (That's part of the game)
Bought a big jet, took my talents to Spain (Yeah)
I had to swerve, they was all in my lane (Skrrt)
On a Tsunami, yeah, like wave
I bought the map (Uh), Bruce Wayne (Wayne)
Sleep on the yacht for like twenty-somethin' days
On a G6 tryna smoke all the Haze (Smoke all the Haze)
