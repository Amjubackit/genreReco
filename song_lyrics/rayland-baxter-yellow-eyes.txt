[Verse 1: Rayland Baxter]
There's a paperclip resting on my countertop
Sunday morning I forgot
What it's like to lose a friend
Yesterday, how it seemed so far away
And I've said all I can say
[Chorus: Rayland Baxter]
Now it's time I get to going
Now it's time I get to find my own way
And I'll leave you lonely
I'll leave you lonely
[Verse 2: Rayland Baxter]
Now I'm on the road
Knowing not which way to go
Is it yes or is it no?
I don't really care
For the golden sun
Has washed me away and I've become
Just another vagabond holding my head
[Chorus: Rayland Baxter]
Now it's time I get to going
Now it's time I get to find my own way
And I'll leave you lonely
I'll leave you lonely[Bridge: Rayland Baxter]
All in all it's a beautiful day
When I wake up all alone I cannot help but run away
Now I'm afraid that it's all in my head
Don't you know that it's all in your head
[Verse 3: Rayland Baxter]
So you rolled the dice
Melt the fire burn the ice
Find the girl with yellow eyes and go and break her heart
See that nothing changes
And I know not what I've become
A prisoner to everyone I've loved from the start
[Chorus: Rayland Baxter]
Now it's time I get to going
Now it's time I get to find my own way
And I'll leave you lonely
I'll leave you lonely
