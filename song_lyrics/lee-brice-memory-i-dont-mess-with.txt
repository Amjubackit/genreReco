[Verse 1]
Red leaves on the river
Footprints in the sand
Cold walk in December
Warming up your hands
Sun dress on the front steps
Sun up by the lake
Blanket down in the backyard
Lying wide awake
[Chorus]
That's a memory I don't mess with
The girl I was the best with
The one I was obsessed with
Girl, you just don't get it
I'd fall right back with one slip
Always leaves me helpless
Don't hate me, I can't help it
Gotta leave us where we left it
You're a memory I don't mess with
[Verse 2]
Moonlight on the back seat
A breeze through the wires
Springsteen on the speakers
Girl, I'm on fire
That's stuff I don't think about
'Cause it still kills me now
I still can't dance around
[Chorus]
That memory I don't mess with
The girl I was the best with
The one I was obsessed with
Girl, you just don't get it
I'd fall right back with one slip
Always leaves me helpless
Don't hate me, I can't help it
Gotta leave us where we left it
You're a memory I don't mess with
[Bridge]
It's good running into you like this
But, girl, I'm close as I can get
[Chorus]
To a memory I don't mess with
The girl I was the best with
The one I was obsessed with
Girl, you just don't get it
I'd fall right back with one slip
Always leaves me helpless
Don't hate me, I can't help it
Gotta leave us where we left it
You're a memory I don't mess with
[Outro]
Red leaves on the river
Footprints in the sand
Cold walk in December
Warming up your hands
