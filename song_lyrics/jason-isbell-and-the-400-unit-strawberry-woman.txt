[Verse 1]
There's a warm wind blowing through the laundromat
There's a young man crying in a cowboy hat
He got square-toed boots, so he ain't for real
Wouldn't last five minutes on a pedal steel
[Chorus]
I remember you at that place in Post
You were thick-cut bacon on Texas toast
Prairie dogs popping up to see
That strawberry woman sitting next to me
Strawberry woman sitting next to me
[Verse 2]
Monday morning, wake up slow
It was Friday night two hours ago
I'd sell the farm to see you smile
But it might just happen if we wait a while
[Chorus 2]
I may go stay out in the woods
Some time apart could do us good
I've been to heaven in a Sixth Street bar
Strawberry woman and an old guitar
Strawberry woman and an old guitar
[Verse 3]
Wеll, the highway's straight and the night's so still
Barely havе to touch the wheel
But it hurts to move and it hurts to learn
I just kept on going when I made a wrong turn
[Chorus 3]
I remember you looking up at me
Drinking Irish whiskey on the Irish sea
And we walked through weather and we walked through time
Strawberry woman with her hand in mine
Strawberry woman with her hand in mine
[Chorus 4]
I remember you when the bar was closed
Dancing on the table with a bloody nose
And you still look fine and you still look free
Strawberry woman with your back to me
Strawberry woman with your back to me
