There's something deep inside of your eyes
All the drama, all the pain
You've been walking through the midnight
And you lost your way
You've been looking for a true friend
Someone who understands
When you need someone to listen
Here I am, oh, here I am
I can see the light in you
I can see the light in you, yeah
Even if it's dark to you
Oh, I can see the light in you
The light in you
It's okay to feel your feelings
You don't have to hurry through
And it's okay, it's okay to cry, you're healing
'Cause when you cry, I cry too
I can see the light in you, yeah
I can see the light in you, oh
Even if it's dark to you, oh
Oh, I can see the light in you
The lightYou can dream again tonight
Spread your wings like butterflies
You were made to shine
I'll bring you out of the hiding
Into more love than you've ever known
And just when you feel like it's over
I'll remind you that you have a future and a hope
'Cause I can see the light in you
I've always seen the light in you
And even when it's dark to you
Oh, I can see the light, I can see the light
The light in you
