[Verse 1: Luke Smallbone]
There are days when you feel life is inside out
There are nights when your mind doesn't want to settle down
You're in between who you are and who you wanna be
And while you work it out and what it all could mean
I pray you'll be
[Chorus: Luke & Joel Smallbone, 
Luke Smallbone
]
Gracious in the fight of it
Humble at the height of it
Choose to love in spite of it all
And when you're
 questioning the why of it
Rise up in the light of it
I'll be by your side in it all
I'm cheering you on
 (
Oh-oh, oh-oh
)
[Verse 2: Joel Smallbone, 
Joel & Luke Smallbone
]
When you win, when you lose, every chance that you take
If you bend, if you break, if you loved anyway
And when you've had enough
No, don't you dare give up
I pray you'll be
[Chorus: Luke & Joel Smallbone, 
Luke Smallbone
]
Gracious in the fight of it
Humble at the height of it
Choose to love in spite of it all
And when you're
 questioning the why of it
Rise up in the light of it
I'll be by your side in it all
I'm cheering you on[Post-Chorus: Luke Smallbone]
Oh-oh, oh-oh
I'm cheering you on and on and on
Oh-oh, oh-oh
[Bridge: Joel Smallbone]
I'll be cheering you on when no one else will
I'll be cheering you on as you run your race
And at the end when if it is finished
May they say you were
[Chorus: Luke & Joel Smallbone, 
Luke Smallbone
]
Gracious in the fight of it
Humble at the height of it
Choose to love in spite of it all
And when you're
 questioning the why of it
Rise up in the light of it
I'll be by your side in it all
I'm cheering you on
[Post-Chorus: Luke Smallbone, 
Luke & Joel Smallbone
]
Oh-oh, oh-oh
I'm cheering you on and on and on
Oh-oh, oh-oh
I'm cheering you on[Outro: Luke Smallbone]
Oh-oh, oh-oh
I'm cheering you on
