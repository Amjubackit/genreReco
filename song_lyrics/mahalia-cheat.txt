[Intro: Mahalia & 
JoJo
]
Once a cheat always a cheat (
Mmhm
)
Once a cheat always a cheat (
Ooh
)
[Verse 1: Mahalia]
You swear you're innocent but that's not the case, uh
You've got that guilt written all over your face
You busybody, you can't stay in one place
You were out romancing and now you're asking for one more chance
[Pre-Chorus: Mahalia]
I'ma give you one more, one more minute
Get up out here, take all your shit
I'm about to reach my limit, boy, please, oh
Tell me that girl is just a friend
Make me beliеve in you and then
You do it again, you hurt me again and again, oh
[Chorus: Mahalia & 
JoJo
]
Oncе a cheat, always a cheat, yeah
That's why I don't believe in what you're saying to me, uh, no, no, no, no
Once a cheat, always a cheat, yeah
I should've used my mind
I should've left you last time (
Oh
)

Mahalia
, 
Both

Now did you really think I wouldn't find out (Haha)
'Bout all your late night escapades on the town 
(Yes, I know)
What happened? You said you'd be holding me down 
(Me down)
'Cause you call me your lover but there's others doing that
My love is not a record, I'm not tryna run it back
One more, one more minute
Get up out here, take all your shit
I'm about to reach my limit, boy, please, oh[Pre-Chorus: Mahalia & 
JoJo

Tell me that girl is just a friend

I

believe
You'd cheat on me 
(On me)
Tell me one thing
Was it worth it, baby?
'Cause it's over, I'm never looking back now
It's the past, what we had is ruined
It's time that I focus on me
So I threw out your stuff, 'cause your ass for the streets
