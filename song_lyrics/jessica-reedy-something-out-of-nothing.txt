Ohhh ohhh
Ooow hooow ohhh
Lord I try so hard to be
The best that I can be
Its like every time I take one step
Something right in front of me
Lord where would I be
With out your grace and mercy
Now I have one question, Lord why me
You changed my whole life ohhh you
You made my wrongs right
And for the rest of my life I'll never know why
You made something out of nothing
Ohhh nothing nothing nothing
You made something out of nothing
You spoke and I was so
Why Ill never know
My life was headed out of control
Some how I shifted in to overload
But then you came
And did a work in me (yeah yeah yeah)
Out of everything I once was some how you saw a masterpiece
You change my whole life
You made my wrongs rights (I never know why)
And for the rest of my life I'll never know why
You made something out of nothing
You made something out of nothing
With my head held high and my hands lifted in the air
I give you all the praise
'Cause you're the only one that could have led me out of this maze
And what you saw in me I don't know
And lord I'm glad you saw it
And every piece of me that was a mystery
Lord you solved it
You change my whole life
You made my wrongs rights (I never know why)
And for the rest of my life I'll never know why
You made something out of nothing
You mad something out of nothing yes you did
Nothing
You changed my whole life
You made my wrongs right, wrongs rights
And for the rest of my life I'll never know why
You made something out of nothing nothing
You made something out of nothing
