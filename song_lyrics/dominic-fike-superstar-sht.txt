[Chorus]
These days don't end
And you lost the things that brought us closer
We're spread so thin
And that's all it takes to knock you over
[Verse 1]
Findin' out the hard way
Forgot how good it feels to be alone, you dig? (Mm)
Watch a movie on your phone, for real
Is this how I'm supposed to feel?
"Save me some," she said, love, I felt like
You could've called it something else
But I couldn't think of nothing else, for real
'Cause it was hard to tell
[Pre-Chorus]
Make it easy for me
Baby, take it easy on me
[Chorus]
These days don't end
And you lost the things that brought us closer
We're spread so thin
And that's all it takes to knock you over
[Verse 2]
Windin' down a long day
Forgot how hard it was to sleep alone in here
Feel like I ain't folded clothes in years
I can't believe it's over still (Over still)
Long way down, you stay 'round the whole time
But it wasn't for yourself, I
I still don't know how you felt, for real, baby
'Cause it was hard to tell, you can't blame me
I don't put on a act for everybody
It wouldn't break your back to stand beside me
Forever and a mile was tantalizin'
I try to force my smile, but can't deny that
