She says nobody wants her
But not for long
She said nobody needs her
Well, girl you're wrong
Well if you see her, tell her
There is room for her
In my arms, in my arms
You don't have to go, you should know
I'll be there for you
When you're alone, I'll be there
To comfort you
Oh baby, please come where its warm
In my arms, in arms
Darling, you should know
I'll be your world
The blanket when it's cold, baby
I'll be your sunshine
In the dark, oh
Cling to me, girl
And you will never fall
Whatever you need
All you gotta do is call
She says nobody wants her
But not for long
She said nobody needs her
But, girl you're wrong
Well if you see her, tell her
There is room for her
In my arms, in my arms
Well, baby please
Come where it's warm
In my arms
