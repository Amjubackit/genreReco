[Chorus]
Well, I figure I'll buy me a motorcycle
Wrap her pretty little frame around a telephone pole
Ride her off a mountain like old Arlo
Figure I'll buy me a motorcycle
[Verse 1]
Well, I figure I'll walk to the liquor store
Thunderbird, two bottles
Maybe three, maybe four
Follow my feet down to Music Row
Pour it on the pavement like you would a tombstone
Like you would a tombstone
Like you would a tombstone
Pour it on the pavement like you would a tombstone
[Verse 2]
Well, I figure I'm weary of feeling this way
Pop another pill, hop another train
Tell my brothers and my sisters that it's keeping me sane
Figure I'm weary of feeling this way
[Chorus]
Well, I figure I'll buy me a motorcycle
Wrap her pretty little frame around a telephone pole
Ride her off a mountain like old Arlo
Figure I'll buy me a motorcycle
Figure I'll buy me a motorcycle
Figure I'll buy me a motorcycle
