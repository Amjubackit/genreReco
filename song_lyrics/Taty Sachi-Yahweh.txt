[Intro]
Yeah, Yahweh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
[Verse 1]
Father you see what's around me
Yeah You don't move
Eyes on the problem, You show me that's not what to do
"Pick up your head," I hear You tell me, faith is still Your tool
And I know better You've shown me things no one else could do
[Chorus]
Yahweh
Here through rain and sunshine
Even when I run away, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yahweh
No matter the season, You give me every reason, ay, yeah, yeah
[Verse 2]
Now I am right where you want me
My mind renewed (My mind renewed)
The struggles and chaos around me doesn't have me moved (You didn't see me move, yeah)
Picked up my head when you told me faith is my tool
You are my child I'll always run right after you (Hey, yeah)
[Chorus]
Yahweh
Here through rain and sunshine
Even when I run away, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yahweh
No matter the season, you give me every reason, ay, yeah, yeah
