[Verse 1: Sam Claflin & Riley Keough]
You found me in flames
It's the daylight of change
Baby, all that stuff is done
[Refrain: Sam Claflin & Riley Keough]
You’re my morning sun
Aurora, you're the one
You're my morning sun
[Verse 2: Sam Claflin & Riley Keough]
When I was away
You called from a fever dream
The crazy ways are done
[Refrain: Sam Claflin & Riley Keough]
You’re my morning sun
How Aurora
You're my morning sun
[Chorus: Sam Claflin, 
Riley Keough
]
I kinda think I wanna make it last forever
(Oh, I kinda think I wanna make it last forever)
Mm, I kinda think I wanna make it last forever
(Oh, I kinda think I wanna make it last forever)
Mm, I kinda think I wanna make it last forever
(Oh, I kinda think I wanna make it)[Verse 2: Sam Claflin & Riley Keough]
Aurora, I'm here
I won't disappear again
How soon can you come?
[Refrain: Sam Claflin & Riley Keough]
You're my morning sun
Aurora, you're thе one
You're my morning sun
Aurora, you're thе one
[Bridge: Sam Claflin, 
Riley Keough

Where did you turn 
(Where did you turn)
When you needed tenderness? 
(When you needed tenderness?)
When you reached out for my touch 
(When you reached out for my touch)
And I couldn’t give you much
Of all the time we lost 
(Of all the time we lost)
While I was runnin’ from your light 
(I was runnin' from your light)
To the shadows of the west 
(To the shadows of the west)
Strung out on the lies 
(Strung out on the lies)
With my tongue out of my mind 
(Tongue out of my mind)
In a Ford Econoline 
(In a Ford Econoline)
[Chorus: Sam Claflin & Riley Keough]
Babe, I kinda thought that night was gonna last forever
(I kinda thought that night was gonna last forever)
Mm, I kinda thought that night was gonna last forever
(I kinda thought that night was gonna last forever)
Mm, I kinda thought that night was gonna last forever
(I kinda thought that night was gonna last forever)[Outro: Sam Claflin & Riley Keough]
I kinda thought that night was gonna last forever
Kinda thought that night was gonna last forever
Kinda thought that night was gonna last forever
Kinda thought that night was gonna last forever
Kinda thought that night was gonna last forever
Kinda thought
