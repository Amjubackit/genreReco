[Intro]
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, yeah
[Verse 1]
And I got this doom and gloom in my mind, yeah
And I got this doom and gloom, but I feel alright
I got love in my heart
[Pre-Chorus 1]
So let's sneak in from the cheap seats, honey
And we'll drive until the engine just gives up
[Chorus]
Feelin' so good right now
Feelin' so good right now
So, we'll crash and burn somehow
Feelin' so good right now, yeah
[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, yeah[Verse 2]
And I know, I know I've made mistakes, yeah
And I know, I know, but at least they were mine to make
They were mine to make
[Pre-Chorus 2]
And all of our wildest dreams, they just end up with a-you and me
So, let's drive until thе engine just gives out
[Chorus]
Feelin' so good right now
Feelin' so good right now
So, wе'll crash and burn somehow
Feelin' so good right now, yeah
[Bridge]
Driftin' from the start, I ripped myself apart
I'll be whatever you need me to be, you need me to be
I cut myself down, cut myself down
To whatever you need me to be, you need me to be
Driftin' from the start, I ripped myself apart
I'll be whatever you need me to be, you need me to be
I cut myself down, cut myself down
To whatever you need me
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh, and all of our wildest dreams, they just end up with a-you and me
So, let's drive until the engine just gives out[Chorus]
Feelin' so good right now
Feelin' so good right now
So, we crash and burn somehow
Feelin' so good right now
Feelin' so good right now
Feelin' so good right now
So, we crash and burn somehow
Feelin' so good right now (So good, so good, so good), yeah
[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
[Outro]
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh (And I know, I know I've made mistakes)
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh (Yeah)
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh (And I know, I know, but at least they were mine to make)
Oh (Yeah)
