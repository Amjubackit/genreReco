[Verse 1: Jack]
Used to keep it cool
Used to be a fool
All about the bounce in my step
Watch it on the news
Whatcha gonna do?
I could hit refresh and forget
Used to keep it cool
[Verse 2: Jack]
Should I keep it light?
Stay out of the fight?
No one’s gonna listen to me
If I write a song
Preaching what is wrong
Will they let me sing on TV?
Should I keep it light?
Is that right?
[Chorus]
Way up way up we go
Been up and down that road
Way up way up, oh no
We gon’ burn the whole house down
Watch me stand in the line
You’re only serving lies
You’ve got something to hide
We gon’ burn the whole house down
We gon’ burn the whole house down
