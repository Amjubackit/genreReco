[Verse]
Stir in me a love that’s deep
A love that’s wide, a love that’s sweet
And help me, Lord, to never keep it to myself
And if my heart should dimly burn
And if my feet should fail to run
Call my name and I will come right back to You
[Chorus]
'Cause there’s no fear in love
And there’s no fear in love
[Verse]
So stir in me a love that’s deep
A love that’s wide, a love that’s sweet
And help me, Lord, to never keep it to myself
And if my heart should dimly burn
And if my feet should fail to run
Call my name and I will come right back to You
[Chorus]
'Cause there’s no fear in love
There’s no fear in love
And there’s no fear in love
And there’s no fear in love[Outro]
I wanna stay close to You
It’s really that simple
I wanna stay close to You
Just as simple as this song
I wanna stay close to You
It’s really that simple
I wanna stay close to You
My whole life long
