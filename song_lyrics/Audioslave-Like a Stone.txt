[Verse 1]
On a cobweb afternoon in a room full of emptiness
By a freeway, I confess I was lost in the pages
Of a book full of death, reading how we'll die alone
And if we're good, we'll lay to rest anywhere we want to go
[Chorus]
In your house, I long to be
Room by room, patiently
I'll wait for you there like a stone
I'll wait for you there alone
[Verse 2]
And on my deathbed, I will pray to the gods and the angels
Like a pagan to anyone who will take me to heaven
To a place I recall, I was there so long ago
The sky was bruised, the wine was bled, and there you led me on
[Chorus]
In your house, I long to be
Room by room, patiently
I'll wait for you there like a stone
I'll wait for you there alone, alone
[Guitar Solo]
