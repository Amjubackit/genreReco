[Intro: RAYE]
Sleazin' and teasin', I'm sittin' on him
All of my diamonds are drippin' on him
I met him at the bar, it was twelve or something
I ordered two more wines 'cause tonight, I want him
[Verse 1: RAYE]
A little context if you care to listen
I find myself in a shit position
The man that I love sat me down last night
And he told me that it's over, dumb decision
And I don't wanna feel how my heart is rippin'
In fact, I don't wanna feel, so I stick to sippin'
And I'm out on the town with a simple mission
In my little black dress and this shit is sittin'
[Pre-Chorus: RAYE]
Just a heart broke bitch, high heels six inch
In the back of the nightclub, sippin' champagne
I don't trust any of these bitches I'm with
In the back of the taxi sniffin' cocaine
Drunk calls, drunk texts, drunk tears, drunk sex
I was lookin' for a man who was on the same page
Now it's back to the intro
, back to the bar
To the Bentley, to the hotel, to my old ways
