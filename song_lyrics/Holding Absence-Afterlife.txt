[Chorus]
I know I'm out of sight
But am I out of mind?
And when I close my eyes
I dream I'll see you in the afterlife
[Verse 1]
I'll pull those arrows from out of your back
One at a time
I know this bridge we built won't last
But it'll hold for at least a while
Even when the life leaves your bones
Your soul will follow me wherever I go
It's in the way I feel your fire even when I sleep at night
I stay inside the glow
[Chorus]
I know I'm out of sight
But am I out of mind?
And when I close my eyes
I dream I'll see you in the afterlife
I know I'm out of sight
But am I out of mind?
And when I close my eyes
I dream I'll see you in the afterlife
