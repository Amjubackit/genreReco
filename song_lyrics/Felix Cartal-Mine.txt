[Verse 1]
I remember we were too broke to have a car
Hitchhiking down the highway to get to the supermarket store
Buying beer with ID's that don't even look like us
But we never cared, we were rich in luck
[Chorus]
We were young and in love
And nothing seemed to matter but the time we spent together
We grew up and lost touch
I'll always keep your photograph warm inside my heart
While I pretend that you're still mine
[Post-Chorus]
Mine
[Verse 2]
I remember graduating top of my class
You already dropped out 'cause life would learn you fast
One bedroom apartment, sleeping on the hardwood floor
But we never cared, eating noodles out the pot
[Chorus]
We were young and in love
And nothing seemed to matter but the time we spent together
We grew up and lost touch
I'll always keep your photograph warm inside my heart
While I pretend that you're still mine
