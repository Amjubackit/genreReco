[Verse 1]
I left my wallet in the hotel room
They barely let me on the plane
I didn’t get a chance to check the news
Somebody shot up a classroom again
[Verse 2]
And when you said the cops just let 'em die
I heard the shaking in your voice
And for a moment you began to cry
Then I heard you make a choice
[Pre-Chorus 1]
We can find a time to fall apart
Say the names of all the dead
I’m still dreaming in my heart of hearts
But something's changing in my head
[Chorus]
Swear you’ll save the world when I lose my grip
Tell me you’re in control
Swear you’ll say the word when I start to slip
'Cause you’ll be the first to know
[Verse 3]
Balloon popping at the grocery store
My heart jumping in my chest
I look around to find the exit door
Which way out of here’s the best
[Verse 4]
The kid's looking through the candy aisle
School's starting in a week
A lady says, "You have a lovely child"
And I’m too terrified to speak
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Can we keep her here at home instead
And can we teach her how to fight?
Something's changing inside my head
Something's drowning out the light
[Chorus]
Swear you’ll save the world when I lose my grip
Tell me you’re in control
Swear you’ll say the word when I start to slip
You’ll be the first to know
[Chorus]
Swear you’ll save the world when I lose my grip
Tell me you’re in control
Swear you’ll say the word when I start to slip
'Cause you’ll be the first to know
[Chorus]
Swear you’ll save the world when I lose my grip
Tell me you’re in control
Swear you’ll say the word when I start to slip
'Cause you’ll be the first to know
