[Verse 1]
Don't do love, don't do friends
I'm only after success
Don't need a relationship
I'll never soften my grip
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't want cash, don't want card
Want it fast, want it hard
Don't need money, don't need fame
I just want to make a change
I just wanna change, I just wanna change
I just wanna change, I just wanna change
I just wanna... change
[Chorus]
I know exactly what I want and who I want to be
I know exactly why I walk and talk like a machine
I'm now becoming my own self-fulfilled prophecy
Oh! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no, oh!
[Verse 2]
One track mind, one track heart
If I fail, I'll fall apart
Maybe it is all a test
'Cause I feel like I'm the worst
So I always act like I'm the best
