[Intro]
I don't wanna hurt no more, no more
No more
[Verse1]
I could pick up when your name lights up
And tell you, "Baby, come on over"
I could say yes, to whatever comes next
And forget about closure
[Pre-Chorus]
I could let your fingertips take control of me in the dark
And not worry about how it ends
Yeah, baby, I could let you start
[Chorus]
Pouring that gas, striking that match
And setting this bed on fire
Shutting those blinds, hitting rewind
And go where we ain't been in a while
I could kiss you once, forget the past
Act like this time's gonna last
And I could and I would let you walk back through that door
But I don't wanna hurt no more, no more, no more
Yeah, I don't wanna hurt no more, no more, no more
[Verse 2]
It's funny how done only really means done
Until you find you way back over
And you only say I miss you drunk and that's the issue
Never when you're sober
I could let you play those games
But you know I know good and well
When we rekindle that burnt out flame
I'll be living in a living hell
[Chorus]
Pouring that gas, striking that match
And setting this bed on fire
Shutting those blinds, hitting rewind
And go where we ain't been in a while
I could kiss you once, forget the past
Act like this time's gonna last
And I could and I would let you walk back through that door
But I don't wanna hurt no more, no more, no more
Yeah, I don't wanna hurt no more, no more, no more
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Pre-Chorus]
I could let your fingertips take control of me in the dark
And not worry about how it ends
Yeah, baby, I could let you start
[Chorus]
Pouring that gas, striking that match
And setting this bed on fire
Shutting those blinds, hitting rewind
And go where we ain't been in a while
I could kiss you once, forget the past
Act like this time's gonna last
And I could and I would let you walk back through that door
But I don't wanna hurt no more, no more, no more
Yeah, I don't wanna hurt no more, no more, no more
