[Verse 1]
At break of day, in hope we rise
We speak Your Name, we lift our eyes
Tune our hearts into Your beat
Where we walk, there You'll be
[Verse 2]
With fire in our eyes, our lives a-light
Your love untamed, it's blazing out
The streets will glow forever bright
Your glory's breaking through the night
[Pre-Chorus]
You will never fade away, Your love is here to stay
By my side, in my life, shining through me everyday
You will never fade away, Your love is here to stay
By my side, in my life, shining through me everyday
[Chorus]
You wake within me, wake within me
You're in my heart forever
You wake within me, wake within me
You're in my heart forever
[Verse 2]
With fire in our eyes, our lives a-light
Your love untamed, it's blazing out
The streets will glow forever bright
Your glory's breaking through the night
[Pre-Chorus]
You will never fade away, Your love is here to stay
By my side, in my life, shining through me everyday
You will never fade away, Your love is here to stay
By my side, in my life, shining through me everyday
[Chorus]
You wake within me, wake within me
You're in my heart forever
You wake within me, wake within me
You're in my heart forever
[Bridge]
Forever, forever, forever in Your love
Forever, forever, forever in Your love
Forever, forever, forever in Your love
Forever, forever, we know that...
[Pre-Chorus]
You will never fade away, Your love is here to stay
By my side, in my life, shining through me everyday
You will never fade away, Your love is here to stay
By my side, in my life, shining through me everyday
[Chorus]
You wake within me, wake within me
You're in my heart forever
You wake within me, wake within me
You're in my heart forever
