[Intro]
Buh-dum buh, buh-dum buh, buh-dum buh, buh-dum buh
Buh-dum buh, buh-dum buh, buh-dum buh
Buh-dum buh, buh-dum buh, buh-dum buh, buh-dum buh
Buh-dum buh, buh-dum buh, buh-dum buh
[Verse 1]
Hello, my old heart
How have you been?
Are you still there inside my chest?
I've been so worried
You've been so still
Barely beating at all
[Chorus]
Oh
Don't leave me here alone
Don't tell me that we've grown
For having loved a little while
Oh, whoa-oh
I don't wanna be alone
I wanna find a home
And I wanna share it with you
