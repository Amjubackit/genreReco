[Verse 1]
Coming from the cold
Buried under heat
Lay you on the floor
Heavy like the force between us
[Verse 2]
Cut me like a rose
Turn me like a beast
Hold me on the floor
Heavy like the force between us
[Pre-Chorus]
I was a ghost
Hunted and fled
Kneeling
There of the heart
God undertow
Feeling
[Chorus]
I was only falling in love
I was only falling in love
I was only falling in love
[Verse 1]
Coming from the cold
Buried under heat
Lay you on the floor
Heavy like the force between us[Verse 2]
Cut me like a rose
Turn me like a beast
Hold you to the floor
Heavy like the force between us
[Pre-Chorus]
I was a ghost
Hunted and fled
Bleeding
There of the heart
God undertow
Feeling
[Chorus]
I was only falling in love
I was only falling in love
I was only falling in love
I was only falling in love
I was only falling in love
[Verse 1]
Coming from the cold
Buried under heat
Lay you on the floor
I was only falling in love[Verse 2]
Cut me like a rose
Turn me like a beast
Hold you to the floor
I was only falling in love
[Chorus]
I was only falling in love
I was only falling in love
