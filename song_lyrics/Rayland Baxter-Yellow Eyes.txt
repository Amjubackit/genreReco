[Verse 1: Rayland Baxter]
There's a paperclip resting on my countertop
Sunday morning I forgot
What it's like to lose a friend
Yesterday, how it seemed so far away
And I've said all I can say
[Chorus: Rayland Baxter]
Now it's time I get to going
Now it's time I get to find my own way
And I'll leave you lonely
I'll leave you lonely
[Verse 2: Rayland Baxter]
Now I'm on the road
Knowing not which way to go
Is it yes or is it no?
I don't really care
For the golden sun
Has washed me away and I've become
Just another vagabond holding my head
[Chorus: Rayland Baxter]
Now it's time I get to going
Now it's time I get to find my own way
And I'll leave you lonely
I'll leave you lonely
