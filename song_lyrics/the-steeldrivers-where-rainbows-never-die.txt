I'm an old man now, I can't do nothing
Young folks don't pay me no mind
But in my day I sure was something
Before I felt the heavy hand of time
I'm an old man now, I'm bound for glory
Time to lay these burdens down
Had enough of this old world of worry
Gonna trade my troubles for a crown
I will make my way across the fields of cotton
And wade through muddy waters one last time
And in my dreams I come out clean
When I reach the other side
West of where the sun sets, where rainbows never die
I've got one last thing to do
One more mile before I'm through
Casting off these earthly chains
Going where there's no more pain
I will make my way across the fields of cotton
And wade through muddy waters one last time
And in my dreams I come out clean
When I reach the other side
West of where the sun sets, where rainbows never dieI'm an old man now, can't do nothing
Young folks don't pay me no mind
