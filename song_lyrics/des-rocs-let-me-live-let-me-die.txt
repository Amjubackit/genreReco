[Intro]
Hey!
Hey!
[Verse 1]
I know pain, I know dread
Look his eyes, they've turned to lead
The tears don't stop the fire
It's killing time
[Verse 2]
Back from the dead
See your eyes, got nothing left
Kiss me, I am the cobra
It's killing time
[Chorus]
Oh, let me live, oh, let me live, oh, let me die
Oh, let me live, oh, let me live, oh, let me die
Oh, let me live, oh, let me live, oh, let me die
Oh, let me live, oh, let me live, oh, let me die
[Verse 3]
Am I here? Am I right?
With a name that I never liked
Rip me out the moment
It's killing time
[Verse 4]
Fear in the dark
Oh, these thoughts, yeah, they never stop
Meet my friend, the lonesome
It's killing time
[Chorus]
Oh, let me live, oh, let me live, oh, let me die
Oh, let me live, oh, let me live, oh, let me die
Oh, let me live, oh, let me live, oh, let me die
Oh, let me live, oh, let me live, oh, let me die
[Bridge]
Ooh
Ooh, ooh
Forever
Ooh, ooh, ooh, whoa
Whoa, oh, oh
Do it again!
[Chorus]
Oh, let me live, oh, let me live, oh, let me die
Oh, let me live, oh, let me live, oh, let me die
Oh, let me live, oh, let me live, oh, let me die
Oh, let me live, oh, let me live, oh, let me die
