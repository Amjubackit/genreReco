Hang my hat, don't think I'll ever get to leave
The door seems to run from my hand
Every change I make will inevitably lead me back
I sit and and stay aren't I comfortable?
Why shouldn't I sleep?
I don't think I understand
Every path, every variable made so it'll bring me back, me back, me back
Meditate, try a medicine all conclusions lead
I'm not meant to live that long
Guilty fate, hope my father don't take it on himself if I'm gone
Sit and stay, what's unbearable
Always something new that I've got to see to the еnd
Hold your phone, record, make and еdit to impose
It's better than Until the end, instead
You'll find me as I try
Ignoring my nature, just strengthens the bond
It will stay when I am gone
So then what's there to fix when
All is wasted. All potential I have lost
Every memory I've embossed is where I was wrong
Hang my hat, don't think I'll ever want to leave
The door never met my sight
Trapped inside, the fluorescent light flickers as it calls Me back
I sit and stay, getting comfortable, this is all I know
I begin to understand
Every path every variable made so it'll bring me back, me back, me back
