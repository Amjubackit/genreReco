[Verse: Njomza]
Take myself somewhere fa-far
Somewhere new
I can't feel you
What am I supposed to do?
I won't look back on things that don't look my way
'Cause time has made me change
It won't let me stay
Why should I care when you absolutely never did?
Don't you know that love
It works both ways
[Pre-Chorus: Njomza]
You can go, go, go
And go, go, go
And go, go, go
And leave
Go, go, go
And go, go, go
And go, go, go
And leave
[Chorus: Njomza]
I'm ridin' solo, baby
I'm ridin' solo
I'm ridin' solo, baby
[Verse: Njomza]
Take myself somewhere fa-far
Somewhere new
I can't feel you
What am I supposed to do?
I won't look back on things that don't look my way
'Cause time has made me change
It won't let me stay
Why should I care when you absolutely never did?
Don't you know that love
It works both ways
[Pre-Chorus: Njomza]
You can go, go, go
And leave- go, go, go
And leave- go, go, go
And leave me
Here alone, go, go
And leave- go, go, go
And leave- go, go, go
And leave me
Here alo-
[Chorus: Njomza]
I'm ridin' solo, baby
I'm ridin' solo
I'm ridin' solo, baby
[Bridge: Njomza]
Fuck it, I don't need you
I can breathe just fine without you here
I said fuck it, I don't need you
I can breathe just fine without you here
I said fuck it, I don't need you
I can breathe just fine without you here
I said fuck it, I don't need you
I'm doing just fine
Fuck it, I don't need you
I can breathe just fine without you here
I said fuck it, I don't need you
I can breathe just fine without you here
I said fuck it, I don't need you
I can breathe just fine without you here
I said fuck it, I don't need you
I'm doing just fine
[Outro: Njomza]
Take myself somewhere fa-far
Somewhere new
I can't feel you
What am I supposed to do?
