[Verse 1]
Tides thrash inside, baby, I'm high octane
Fever in a shock wave
My core vibrates in an opium haze
Yet you think we're the same
[Chorus]
The skyline falls as I try to make sense of it all
I thought I'd uncovered your secrets but, turns out, there's more
You adored me before
Oh, my good looking boy
[Verse 2]
Play casino holes of my eyeballs
Roll the dice on my thighs
You stopped for breath and I sped up
Just to impress you
[Chorus]
The skyline falls as I try to make sense of it all
I thought I'd uncovered your secrets but, turns out, there's more
You adored me before
Oh, my good looking boy
[Refrain]
My good looking boy
My good looking boy
My good looking boy
Oh, my good looking boy
