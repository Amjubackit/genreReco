[Verse 1]
I've been strong
And I’ve been broken within a moment
I've been faithful
And I've been reckless at every bend
I’ve held everything together
And watched it shatter
I've stood tall and I have crumbled
In the same breath
[Verse 2]
I have wrestled
And I have trembled toward surrender
Chased my heart adrift
And drifted home again
Plundered blessing
Till I've been desperate to find redemption
And every time I turn around
Lord You're still there
[Pre-Chorus 1]
I was found
Before I was lost
I was Yours
Before I was not
Grace to spare
For all my mistakes
And that part just wrecks me[Chorus]
And I know I don't deserve this kind of love
Somehow this kind of love is who You are
It's a grace I could never add up
To be somebody You still want
Somehow You love me as You find me
[Verse 3]
Who am I
To think Your glory needs my praises
But if this borrowed breath is Yours Lord
Take it all
You are faithful and You are gracious
And I'm just grateful
To think You don't need a single thing
And still You want my heart
[Pre-Chorus 2]
I was found
Before I was lost
I was Yours
Before I was not
You wear the scars
For all my mistakes
And that part just wrecks me[Chorus 2]
And I know I don’t deserve this kind of love
Somehow this kind of love is who You are
It’s a grace I could never add up
To be somebody You still want
Somehow You love me as You find me
You love me as You find me
You love me as You find me
You love me as You find me
[Tag]
Your love's too good to leave me here
