My life was torn beyond repair
I felt so alone, seemed no one cared
You came along, gave me a song
To ease the pain and erase the strain
You could have left me standing there
With no one, no one to care
But You promised me You'd be there on time
And You did just what You said
Against all odds, I made the choice
To give You my life, now I rejoice
You answered my prayers not a moment to soon
Your word I embraced, my sins You erased
You could have left me standing there
With no one, no one to care
But You promised me You'd be there on time
And You did just what You said
[Chorus]
(I gave it up) That's when You bless me
(Oh I let it go) That's when You bless me
(Lord, You brought me through, now I'm brand new)
Yes
