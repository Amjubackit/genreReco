[Intro: Sample from "Nutcracker Suite"]
Just imagine a trip to a wonderful land
Of candy, and jam, and ice cream
[Verse 1: Zoé Colotis]
I gotta hit that street, you better watch it
With a gat that I cock, with a full clip
I got the whip, got the pitch, gotta keep it undercover
All up in the club, just to live it up
See the stone cold face, try to knock it
I can't be trapped, never walk, I'm a rocket
I got a beat in it, I got a breath in it
I got a beat, got a beat, got a beat, a beat, a beat, a beat
[Horn Solo/Chorus]
[Verse 2: Zoé Colotis]
See the big gold chain that I'm rockin'?
I got the ring for the bling, not a problem
I got a stash full of cash that I owe to my brother
All up in the club, just to live it up
Look how the streets turn cold when I walk it
It's my rules, no man can stop it
I throw a kick so quick that'll leave you in the gutter
Leave you in the gutter, gutter, gutter, gutter, gutter
(See the big gold chain that I'm)
