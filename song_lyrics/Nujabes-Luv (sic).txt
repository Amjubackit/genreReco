[Intro: Bill Cosby & 
Shing02
]
I told you that story to tell you this one
Check this 
out, this goes o
ut to my G
[Verse 1: Shing02]
Lovesick like a dog with canine sensitivity
Developing this new theory of relativity
Connecting our souls resting in captivity
Positive life sacrifice what it is to me
Our history, only a quarter of a century
Reality, sitting on the shoulders of our chemistry
See, 
ain't no mystery
The colors that we mix will set the mind free
Let the blind see beyond harmony
Breathe life into dead space blow away your clouds of doubt
New territory we determine to be
Everything a safe haven it's supposed to be
Now it might seem distant but the time is near
When our thoughts take off and split the atmosphere
Pure sound wave travel semi-infinitely
Plus I'll see you there utmost definitely
[Hook: Shing02 & 
Richard Pryor
]
'Cause the beat plus the melody
Makes me speak of L.O.V.E. eloquently, so evidently
(I mean that from my heart cause you make me feel good as a person)
'Cause the beat plus the melody
Makes me speak of L.O.V.E. eloquently, so evidently
