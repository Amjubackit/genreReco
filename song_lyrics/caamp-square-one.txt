[Verse 1]
Had to find some higher ground
Had some fear to get around
You can't say what you don't know
Later on won't work no more
Last time through, I hid my tracks
So well I could not get back
Yeah, my way was hard to find
Can't sell your soul for peace of mind
[Chorus]
Square one, my slate is clear
Rest your head on me my dear
It took a world of trouble, it took a world of tears
It took a long time to get back here
[Bridge]
Try so hard to stand alone
Struggle to see past my nose
Always had more dogs than bones
I could never wear those clothes
It's a dark victory
You won and you also lost
Told her you were satisfied
But it nеver came across
[Chorus]
Square onе, my slate is clear
Rest your head on me my dear
It took a world of trouble, it took a world of tears
It took a long time to get back here
[Chorus]
Square one, my slate is clear
Rest your head on me my dear
It took a world of trouble, it took a world of tears
It took a long time to get back here
Square one, my slate is clear
Rest your head on me my dear
It took a world of trouble, it took a world of tears
It took a long time to get back here
