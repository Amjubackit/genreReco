[Verse 1]
I still have your picture on the wall
I still have the nightmares where I would have to call you to calm down
I still think about you all the time
When I step out of the shower I’m reminded of the night
When we slept in the back of your car
And you left me with a pretty cool scar
[Chorus]
Did it hurt
When I kicked you to the curb?
Now I’m all alone
I guess I’ll never learn
[Verse 2]
Your purple sweater's sitting in my room
I tried to wear it, but I knew that it would smell like you
I saw you dancing at the show tonight
I stood in the back
And I think that we both know why
[Chorus]
Did it hurt
When I kicked you to the curb?
Now I’m all alone
I guess I’ll never learn
