[Verse 1]
I don't want anything but You
You're more than every dream come true
All of the things I thought I wanted
Don't come close to knowing You
Now that I'm Yours and You are mine
Our love is the secret that I find
I'll spend forever in the pleasure
I've found looking in Your eyes
[Chorus]
Give me Jesus
Give me Jesus
You can have all this world
You can have all this world
[Verse 2]
More than silver, more than gold
You are the treasure that I hold
Now that I've tastеd of Your goodness
Nothing else will satisfy
[Chorus]
Just givе me Jesus
Give me Jesus
And you can have all this world
You can have all this world
Give me Jesus
Give me Jesus
And you can have all this world
You can have all this world
[Post-Chorus]
Just give me Jesus
I only want Jesus
I only want Jesus
I only want Jesus
[Bridge]
I don't want anyone else
I don't need anything else
You are my one thing
You are my one thing
I don't want anyone else
I don't need anything else
You are my one thing
You are my one thing
I don't want anyone else
I don't need anything else
You are my one thing
You are my one thing
I don't want anyone else
And I don't need anything else
'Cause You are my one thing
You are my one thing
You are my one thing
You are my one thing
You are my one thing
[Chorus]
Just give me Jesus
Give me Jesus
You can have all this world
You can have all this world
Give me Jesus
Give me Jesus
You can have all this world
You can have all this world
[Bridge]
Oh, and I don't want anyone else
And I don't need anything else
'Cause You are my one thing
You are my one thing
I don't want anyone else
And I don't need anything else
'Cause You are my one thing
You are my one thing
Oh, I don't want anyone else
