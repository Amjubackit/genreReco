[Intro]
Yo, this is my sick beat
[Verse 1]
Your eyes hypnotized, starin' at me
Ice in my veins and my heart on my sleeve
Teach me a lesson, a lesson
Her sex is a weapon
Bad calls, chemicals burnin' my brain
The way that you love me is fuckin' insane
Hands on my body, body
I'm feelin' godly
[Chorus]
I'm a friend of the devil
I'm a dangerous rebel
It's the life that I can't escape, can't walk away-ay-ay
There's blood in the ocean
And I'm losin' focus
I'm a friend of the devil
I'm a friend of the devil
[Verse 2]
Youngblood, old love, tears at the seams
Fightin' my way through the sins of the street
I'm feelin' psycho, psycho
Where did my mind go?
Bitin' my tongue and I'm loadin' my gun
Back to the wind, better run, better run
I'm feelin' crazy, crazy
Go 'head and make me[Chorus]
I'm a friend of the devil
I'm a dangerous rebel
It's the life that I can't escape, can't walk away-ay-ay
There's blood in the ocean
And I'm losin' focus
I'm a friend of the devil
I'm a friend of the devil
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
I'm a friend of the devil
I'm a dangerous rebel
It's the life that I can't escape, can't walk away-ay-ay
There's blood in the ocean
And I'm losin' focus
I'm a friend of the devil
I'm a friend of the devil
I'm a friend of the devil
I'm a dangerous rebel
It's the life that I can't escape, can't walk away-ay-ay
There's blood in the ocean
And I'm losin' focus
I'm a friend of the devil
I'm a friend of the devil
