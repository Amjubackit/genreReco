[Verse 1: Elle King]
We've been turnin' into strangers
Now we barely even touch
Superficial conversation
'Cause our guard is always up
[Pre-Chorus: Elle King]
I'm not ready to give up on us yet
One last hurrah, it might just do the trick
[Chorus: Elle King & Dierks Bentley]
Might be in a bottle, a little proof from the past
Might be at the bottom of an empty glass
Don't know if the whiskey can fix it or not
But, baby, it's worth a shot
One shot from the top of the shelf
Maybe two, what the hell
'Cause we've been on the rocks
One shot may be all that we got
I don't know about you, but I think it's worth a shot
[Verse 2: Dierks Bentley, 
Dierks Bentley & Elle King
]
Yeah, if we could lose our inhibitions
And say what we need to say
Thеn maybe both of us could listen
And get our pridе out of the way
