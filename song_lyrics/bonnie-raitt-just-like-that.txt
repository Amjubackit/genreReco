[Verse 1]
I watched him circle 'round the block, finally stopped at mine
Took a while before he knocked like all he had was time
"Excuse me, ma’am, maybe you can help, the directions weren't so clear
I'm looking for Olivia Zand, they said I might find her here"
Well, I looked real hard and asked him, "What she’s got he's looking for?"
Said, "There's somethin' I think she'd wanna know" and I let him in the door
It's not like me to trust so quick, caught me by surprise
But somеthin' about him gave me easе, right there in his eyes
[Chorus]
And just like that, your life can change if I hadn't looked away
My boy might still be with me now, he’d be twenty-five today
No knife can carve away the stain, no drink can drown regret
They say Jesus brings you peace and grace, well, He ain’t found me yet
[Post-Chorus]
Na-na-na, na, na
Na-na-na, na, na
Na, na, na-na-na-na
[Verse 2]
He sat down and took a deeper breath, then looked right in my face
I heard about the son you lost, how you left without a trace
I've spent years just tryna find you so I could finally let you know
It was your son’s heart that saved me, and a life you gave us both[Chorus]
And just like that, your life can change, look what the angels send
I lay my head upon his chest and I was with my boy again
Well, I've spent so long in darkness, I never thought the night would end
But somehow, grace has found me, and I had to let Him in
[Post-Chorus]
Na-na-na, na, na
Na-na-na, na, na
Na, na, na-na-na-na
Na-na-na, na, na
Na-na-na, na, na
Na, na, na-na-na
Na-na-na, na, na
Na-na-na, na, na
Na, na, na-na-na
Na-na-na, na, na
Na-na-na, na, na
Na, na, na-na-na-na
