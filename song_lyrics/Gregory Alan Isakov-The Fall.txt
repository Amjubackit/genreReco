The fall, the fall, the fall
I keep stumbling back
Ivory bone opera glass
Angles of attack
You heard blood was thick, brothers and sisters
But ya don’t know where anybody’s at
Time was a bust, you thought you’d better be tough
Nobody gets past
The trembling wire
All eyes on you now, on you
We’re all holding our breath
All eyes on you now, on you
We’re still holding our breath
We all break a little
We all break a little
We all break a little when we fall
And everybody keeps saying, “Gеt up, get up”
The fall, the fall, thе fall
“Go on, get up”
The fall, the fall, the fall
