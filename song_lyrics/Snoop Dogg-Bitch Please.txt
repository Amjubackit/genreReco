[Intro: Xzibit]
Yeah, time to bring your ass to the table, y’all
It’s X to the Z, Xzibit, yeah
Snoop double D, uh, OG
(Where you at? West Coast, Los Angeles)
What
Bringin' it live, Dr. Dre, what
Throwin' up a big ass W
Coverin' up the world, right
Yeah, ha
Listen, look
[Verse 1: Xzibit]
You ain't tryna hot box with me
, 
I swig hard liquor
Goin' down by the second round, all hail the underground
How that sound? Xzibit backin' down from a conflict
Fuck the nonsense! Terrorist, here to bomb shit
Glass and metal in every direction
Innocent bystanders taught a very hard lesson
I'm the reason there's no time to reach for that weapon
And reason why niggas with problems keep on steppin'
Xzibit ready to scrap like Mike Tyson with his license back
9 to 5 minimum wage? What type of life is that?
For me? It's blasphemy, you fuckin' around
With the Sundance Kid and Butch Cassidy
You had the audacity to wanna tangle with the X
Strangle your neck, slap you like the opposite sex
Drunk drivin', tryna stack my loot
While other rappers gettin' Treated Like a Prostitute
