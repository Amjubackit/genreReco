[Verse 1]
I tried my best just to get away
But you pulled me closer
You're something wild I can never tame
And you're taking over
All my thoughts and the words I say
Never seem to matter
You're the drug running through my veins
And the crash right after
[Chorus]
(You're the drug running through my veins)
And the crash right after
You're the drug running through my veins
And the crash right after
(You're the drug running through my veins)
You're the drug running through my veins
And the crash right after
[Drop]
Oh woah-oh, oh woah-oh, oh woah-oh
You're the drug running through my veins
And the crash right after
[Verse 2]
Never thought I would be okay
When the pain took over
A disease moving through my brain
Makes my vision slower
Try and run but I can't escape
As my whole world shatters
You're the drug running through my veins
And the crash right after[Chorus 2]
Oh woah-oh, oh woah-oh, oh woah-oh
And the crash right after
Oh woah-oh, oh woah-oh, oh woah-oh
And the crash right after
You're the drug running through my veins
And the crash right after
[Drop]
And the crash right after
And the crash right after
Oh woah-oh, oh woah-oh, oh woah-oh
Oh woah-oh, oh woah-oh, oh woah-oh
Drug running through my veins
And the crash right after
