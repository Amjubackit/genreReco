[Verse 1]
I sent My only Son
To be with whom I love
You are all I want
The wonder of it all
From Heaven's gates
You catch my gaze
[Chorus]
And I love you in the morning, in the noontime, in the evening
You're My one thing, you're My dearest
Here's My love note, can you hear it?
[Verse 2]
A dinner for two, just Me and you
Let's take some time to sit down and dine
I broke My bread and poured out My wine
I did what it took to make you My bride
I'm bringing you back to the garden
Back where it all started
All your sins have been pardoned
Now we just get to be together
Now we just get to be together
Now we just get to be together
Now we just get to be together
Now we just get to be together
[Chorus]
And I love you in the morning, in the noontime, in the evening
You're My one thing, you're My dearest
Here's My love note, can you hear it?
And I love you in the morning, in the noontime, in the evening
You're My one thing, you're My dearest
Here's My love note, can you hear it?
[Interlude]
Can you hear it?
Do you hear it?
Writing words over you
Singing songs over you
[Bridge]
I'm above you, I'm beneath you
I'm before you, I'm behind you
I'm above you, I'm beneath you
I'm before you, I'm behind you
I'm above you, I'm beneath you
I'm before you, I'm behind you
I'm above you, I'm beneath you
I'm before you, I'm behind you
I'm all around you
I'm all around you
Baby, I'm all around you
I'm all around you
I'm above you, I'm beneath you
I'm before you, I'm behind you
I'm above you, I'm beneath you
I'm before you, I'm behind you
I'm above you, I'm beneath you
I'm before you, I'm behind you
I'm above you, I'm beneath you
I'm before you, I'm behind you
I'm all around you
I'm all around you
I'm all around you
I'm all around you
[Chorus]
And I love you in the morning, in the noontime, in the evening
You're My one thing, you're My dearest
Here's My love note, can you hear it?
And I love you in the morning, in the noontime, in the evening
You're My one thing, you're My dearest
Here's My love note, can you hear it?
