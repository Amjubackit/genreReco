[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
(Buck 'em)
Damn, this shit sound low than a motherfucker in my earphones
Alright, yeah that's it right there nigga
[Verse 1]
As soon as the bass hits your dome
Snoop Dogg grabs the chrome and gets in your system
Shootin off rhymes like a pistol
Fuckin your click off with this blow
This ho, that ho make me rich
Snoop Dogg please won't you break that biatch
I'm back in the game gettin my dough
And fuck any motherfucker that say it ain't so
Do it to em, D.O
Cause on the real, dog you the hardest nigga we know
I'm shakin' 'em off, breakin' 'em off
Shot him in his face and now they takin him off
Here's a shoutout to those with a plot out
Fool we should have got out, now you gettin popped out
I'm not out to diss but to get my chips
And smash, pass with cash
And blaze the spliff now pass the fifth
For real nigga did you hear me? Ya heard
You ran up and got served, ha ha
Now ain't that a trip (what what)
You need to get up off of that bullshit
C'mon
