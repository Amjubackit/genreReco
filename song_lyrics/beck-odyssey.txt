[Verse 1: Beck, 
Thomas Mars
]
Take my time to find my mind
Don't have time to go back to zero and wait for yesterday
Summer days, the flowers waste, I'm on fire
Welcome to your life, don't look the other way
Wheels of fortune run the course across the track
If only I could feel the warmth across my back
Didn't I treasure most
Didn't I wreck the most
Didn't I feel this close
Don't look the other way
[Chorus: Beck & Thomas Mars]
Somewhere
We'll fall into the ocean
I'll be there
On an odyssey in the sun
[Refrain: Beck & Thomas Mars]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, you might have to lose to win
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, you might have to lose to win
[Verse 2: Thomas Mars, 
Beck
]
Before you came into the light
It was always so bright
And now I'm not trying to look the other way
Count to ten, renovate my life
The savior a la mode
A photo op is imminent[Chorus: Beck & Thomas Mars]
Somewhere
We'll fall into the ocean
I'll be there
On an odyssey in the sun
[Refrain: Beck & Thomas Mars]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, you might have to lose to win
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, you might have to lose to win
[Bridge: Beck, 
Thomas Mars
]
A hornet's nest of blessings
I confess it's messing
With my mind the way
We live and die in a day, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Summer Odyssey, Summer Odyssey)
A catastrophic longing
All these thoughts are dawning
Lost inside the gnawing feeling
I'm not okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
 (An odyssey, tell me all you see)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
 (An odyssey, tell me all you see)
(An odyssey, Summer Odyssey)
(An odyssey, tell me all you see)[Breakdown: Beck & Thomas Mars]
Somewhere
We'll fall into the ocean
I'll be there
On an odyssey in the sun
[Outro: Beck & Thomas Mars]
Somewhere
We'll fall into the ocean
I'll be there
On an odyssey in the sun
