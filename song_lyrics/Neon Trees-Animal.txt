[Verse 1]
Here we go again
I kinda wanna be more than friends
So take it easy on me
I'm afraid you're never satisfied
[Verse 2]
Here we go again
We're sick like animals, we play pretend
You're just a cannibal
And I'm afraid I won't get out alive
No, I won't sleep tonight
[Chorus]
Oh-oh, I want some more
Oh-oh, what are you waiting for?
Take a bite of my heart tonight
Oh-oh, I want some more
Oh-oh, what are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
Say goodbye to my heart tonight
[Verse 2]
Here we are again
I feel the chemicals kickin' in
It's getting heavy and I wanna run and hide
I wanna run and hide
I do it every time
You're killin' me now
And I won't be denied by you
The animal inside of you
