[Intro]
Can you feel that?
Ah, shit
Ooh, wah-ah-ah-ah!
Ooh, wah-ah-ah-ah!
Oh, oh! Oh, oh!
Oh, oh!
[Verse 1]
Drowning deep in my sea of loathing
Broken, your servant, I kneel
(Will you give in to me?)
It seems what's left of my human side
Is slowly changing in me
(Will you give in to me?)
[Pre-Chorus]
Looking at my own reflection
When, suddenly, it changes, violently, it changes
Oh, no, there is no turning back now
You've woken up the demon in me
[Chorus]
Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Open up your hate and let it flow into me
Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
You mother, get up, come on, get down with the sickness
You fucker, get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Madness is the gift that has been given to me
