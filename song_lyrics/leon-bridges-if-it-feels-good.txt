[Intro]
Hhhhhh
[Verse 1]
Live from the funk
It's hotter than Texas
Right from the jump, yeah
You got my attention
You give me that stuff
And it’s such a blessin'
You and I in the light
Alone in this heaven
[Pre-Chorus]
Aww baby, aww, aww baby
Say you will, say you might
If this is wrong, then nothing’s right
Aww baby, aww, aww baby
See yourself like I do
Oh, tonight looks good on you
[Chorus]
Hey, mys-terious
We don’t have to act so serious-ly
Like nobody’s watching, only us
Baby, if it feels good, then it must be
Bad how much I want you
Baby, if it feels good, then it must be
Bad how much I want you
