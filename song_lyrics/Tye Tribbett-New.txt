[Intro]
Ah-Ah
Tripp (Ah-Ah)
Sheesh
[Chorus]
New, new, new
Everything new, new, new, new
New, new, everything new (Everything fresh, everything, everything)
New, new, new
Everything new, new, new, new
New, new, everything new (Yeah, woo)
[Post-Chrous]
I'm ready to go
Ready for more
I'm ready for new, like it's straight out the the store
You alrеady know
I'm ready to flow
I'm ready to move thе old is through
I'm in pappa's new bag
And it still got the tag
So you know that it's new
[Verse 1]
New mind, new heart
I got that new start
New light, new day
It's my life His way
New praise, new look
New page, new book
New flame, burn up
New wine, turn up
Looked at my hands, they look brand new
Looked at my feet, they look new too
New joy, new strength
I'm loving this newness
Past is long gone
It's time to sing a new song
