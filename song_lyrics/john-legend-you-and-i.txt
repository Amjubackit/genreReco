[Verse 1]
Ahh, Yeah
You fix your makeup just so
Guess you don't know that you're beautiful
Try on every dress that you own
You were fine in my eyes, a half hour ago
And if your mirror won't make it any clearer
I'll be the one to let you know
[Chorus]
Out of all of the girls
You're my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight
All of the stars
You make them shine like they were ours
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I
You and I
Ain't nobody in the world but you
[Verse 2]
You stop the room when we walk in
The spotlight's on , everybody's staring
Tell all of these boys they're wasting their times
Stop standing in line cause you're all mine
And this evening, I won't let this feeling die
I never want to leave your side[Chorus]
Out of all of the girls
You're my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight
All of the stars
You make them shine like they were ours
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I
You and I
Ain't nobody in the world
[Bridge]
You keep wondering if you're what I wanted
You don't even have to try
Ahh, you don't have to try
Don't try, don't try
You don't have to try
[Chorus]
Out of all of the girls
You're my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight
All of the stars
They don't shine brighter than you are
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I
You and I
You and I
Nobody in the world tonight
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I
