[Verse 1: Mitch Wong]
Everything changed, it's getting harder to recognize
The person I was before I encountered Christ
I don't walk like I used to
I don't talk like I used to
I've been washed from the inside
I've been washed from the inside out
[Chorus: Mitch Wong, 
Mitch Wong & Jenn Johnson
]
Hallelujah, hallelujah
I know it was the blood
Could have only been the blood
Hallelujah, hallelujah
I know it was the blood
Could have only been the blood
Ayy
[Verse 2: Jenn Johnson, Jenn Johnson & Mitch Wong]
I cannot explain, but nothing's more real than this
In the presence of God, oh, what my hеart experiencеd
When my shame hit the wayside
And my sin met the Most High
I was washed from the inside
I was washed from the inside out
[Chorus: Mitch Wong & Jenn Johnson]
Hallelujah, hallelujah
I know it was the blood
Could have only been the blood
Hallelujah, hallelujah
I know it was the blood
Could have only been the blood[Post-Chorus: Mitch Wong, 
Jenn Johnson
]
Could have only been Your blood
Oh, so let it wash over
Let it wash over me, yeah, yeah
Ayy, ooh-ooh-ooh
[Bridge: Mitch Wong & Jenn Johnson]
It's never been about performance, perfection
Or striving for acceptance
Let me tell you, it's only by the blood
It's never been about deserving or earning
It's a gift that's freely given
Let me tell you, it's only by the blood
Does anybody want to be holy, righteous
Purified and spotless?
Let me tell you, it's only by the blood
Does anybody want to be worthy, forgiven
Justified, really living?
Let me tell you, it's only by the blood
[Chorus: Mitch Wong & Jenn Johnson]
Hallelujah, hallelujah
I know it was the blood
Could have only been the blood
Hallelujah, hallelujah
I know it was the blood
Could have only been the blood
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Only been[Spontaneous: Mitch Wong, 
Mitch Wong & Jenn Johnson

What can I say? "Thank You" is not enough
Jesus, Your grace, Your mercy poured out for us
I will love You forever, 
here on Earth into Heaven
I've been washed from the inside
I've been washed from the inside
 out
Hmm, mm
I've been washed from the inside out
Mm
[Outro: Mitch Wong, 
Mitch Wong & Jenn Johnson
]
How precious, how generous
Your blood poured out for us
How precious, how generous
We remember, mm
You paid it in full
You paid it in blood
You paid it for us,
 Jesus
