[Part I]
[Chorus]
My eyes are green
'Cause I eat a lot of vegetables
It don't have nothing to do with your new friend
My eyes are green
'Cause I eat a lot of vegetables
It don't have nothing to do with your new friend
[Verse 1]
I don't care, I swear
I'm too through with you, I am
You don't mean nothing to me
So go ahead and be with your friend
[Chorus]
My eyes are green
'Cause I eats a lot of vegetables
It don't have nothing to do with your new friend
[Part II]
[Intro]
I'm insecure
But I can't help it
My mind says move on
My heart lags behind
But I don't love you any more
I'm so insecure
Never knew that love did this
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
