[Verse 1: Russell Marsden and 
Emma Richardson
]
High, ho, 
triple salchow
I got a feeling like a tidal flow
But I know what I am
They know what they are, so let me be
Gasoline, saccharine
I got no reason for the state I'm in
But I know what I am
They know what they are, so let me be
Hotel, Taco Bell
I got the hit that you know damn well
But I know what I am
They know what they are, so let me be
Cut teeth, better believe
I got a feeling that I'm underneath
But I know what I am
They know what they are, so let me be
[Chorus]
But it's alright, it's okay
I got the time, but the time don't pay
It's alright, it's okay
I got the time, but the time don't pay
It's alright, it's okay
I got the time, but the time don't pay
It's alright, it's okay[Verse 2: Russell Marsden and 
Emma Richardson
]
Flick flack,
 no slack
I got the wit that my enemies lack
But I know what I am
They know what they are, so let me be
Trick some, just begun
Giving you more when you really want one
'Cause I know what I am
They know what they are, so let me be
Whoo, hot sweat, got debt
Keep your liquor in the locker, 'cause you don't know yet
But I know what I am
They know what they are, so let me be
Ship shape, ticker tape
Looks to me like a narrow escape
But I know what I am
They know what they are, so let me be
[Chorus]
But it's alright, it's okay
I got the time, but the time don't pay
It's alright, it's okay
I got the time, but the time don't pay
It's alright, it's okay
I got the time, but the time don't pay
It's alright, it's okay[Outro]
I know what I am
They know what they are, so let me be
I know what I am
I know what I am
They know what they are, so let me be
I know what I am
I know what I am
They know what they are, so let me be
I know what I am
I know what I am
They know what they are, so let me be
I know what I am
They know what they are, so let me be
I know what I am
They know what they are, so let me be
I know what I am
They know what they are, so let me be
