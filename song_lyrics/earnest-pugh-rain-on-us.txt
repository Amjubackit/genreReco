Let your glory fill this place
Let your all-consuming fire, fill this tabernacle
Purify our hearts
Surround us in this place
And breathe new life within us
Send a refreshing glory
Purify our hearts

Let your glory fill this place
Let your all-consuming fire, fill this tabernacle
And purify our hearts

And breathe new life within us
Send a refreshing glory
Saturate our hearts

Rain on us, Breathe on us
Shower down, Shower down
Send your Spirit, Lord
Rain on us, Lord breathe on your people tonight (Breathe on us)
Shower down, Shower down
