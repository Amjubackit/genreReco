Will He fail? (
Never

Will He come through for me? (
Always

How long will He show me that He's still God? (
Forever

He watches over His word, watches over His word to perform
Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes, He does
I will remind him of Abraham
When all he had was God's word carrying him
And even when it hurted him the most, he still had faith in his God
To lift his voice and declare
(
The Lord will provide

He will provide, somebody declare, the Lord
(
The Lord will provide

He will provide
(
The Lord will provide
)
You oughta wave your hand and shout, the Lord, He will provide
(
The Lord will provide
