[Intro: GRiZ]
Outer space travelers or astronauts are reaching new heights these days
Who knows where their adventures will take them next
[Verse 1: ProbCause]
Yo Scotty beam me up for the mission I'm ready what's poppin'
Kerosine drippin' out my pocket high like a rocket
Bout to throw a rager in the cockpit
Heads gonna knock in the mosh pit
Havy weight base m-m-make the earth shake when I drop it
Now we got the whole place rockin'
Now wе got the whole place rockin'
H-h-h-h-havy wеight base (king) make the earth shake when I drop it
Now we got the whole place rockin'
[Pre-Drop: Chrishira Perrier]

B-b-bass go boom with the kick and the drum
W-w-we got the sound to rock ya system

Bounce to the moon screamin' all aboard
Smoke trailblaze go, go, go speed racer
Mach 5 fast but who don't like a little bit of danger
Boom, cookin' up the mmmm... food

Yeah I'm just playin' my part
The great bambino bout to hit it out the pa-a-a-a-ark
[Pre-Drop: Chrishira Perrier]
