Come to me baby, don't be shy
Don't be shy, don't be shy

It was a summer time, that summer high
Oh what a masterpiece
The way your eyes met mine
Sweet like apple pie, caught in your energy
The future came to me, I see

You and me, the magic
And I know we have it
Cause it feels, yeah, it feels, yeah, it feels so classic
Cause it feels, yeah, it feels, yeah, it feels so classic

[Verse 2]
Oh what a summer time, when we lost our minds
Between the birds and bees
Buzzing under blue sky till the full moon rise
Playing with chemistry
Baby are you with me,? Oh
