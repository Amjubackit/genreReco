[Verse 1:]
It makes no difference what your going through
You're going to make it, God's going to see you through
Hold your head up, put a smile on your face
This is another test, it won't last always
[Chorus:]
Get ready for your blessing
Get ready for your miracle
Get ready for your blessing
Get ready for your miracle
[Verse 2:]
I know you've been hurting deep down inside
Let me encourage you, it's going to be alright
Troubles and trials come to make you strong
Keep on believing, you keep holding on
[Chorus]
[Vamp:]
(God's got a blessing), God's got a blessing
(God's got a blessing), God's got a blessing
(God's got a blessing), God's got a blessing
(God's got a blessing), God's got a blessing
