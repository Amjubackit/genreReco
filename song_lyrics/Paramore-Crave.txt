[Verse 1]
I can't wait to memorize this day
Oh, a picture could not contain the way it feels
You say, "Live in the present"
I'm already dreamin' of how it begins
And tryin' to savor the moment
But I know the feelin' will come to an end
[Chorus]
So I crave, crave
To do it again, all again
Crave, crave
To do it again, I
Just for a second, it all felt simple
I'm already missin' it
So I crave, crave
To do it again, all again
[Verse 2]
I romanticize even the worst of times
When all it took to make me cry was bein' alive
Look up and see a reflection
Of someone who never gave way to the pain
What if I told 'em that now that I'm older
There isn't a moment that I'd wanna change?
