[Verse 1]
On my Fridays when it's whiskey, I go back to Cincy
That Ohio night you tricked me into buyin' all your shots
Got your ghost up in my Chevy, shotgun lookin' ready
For them parties where you'd let me spin you 'round and show you off
I been tryin' to get away from you for a while now
But there ain't no settin' you down
[Chorus]
You're my sunrise, you keep comin' up
You're in every conversation, every smoky situation
If it's water, if it's whiskey in my cup
You're the memories I'm drinkin', you're the thoughts I'm always thinkin', girl
It don't matter how far I run, you're the one that I can't run from
Used to be my late nights, loved me 'til thе daylights
Now you're just my sunrise, you keep comin' up, you keep comin' up
You keep comin', yeah, you keep comin'
[Verse 2]
Comin' up at 8 A.M., 9 A.M.
All thе way to 10 P.M. when my day ends
Layin' down and there you are in my Amens
Mornin' light and you're there on my mind again
[Chorus]
You're my sunrise, you keep comin' up
You're in every conversation, every smoky situation
If it's water, if it's whiskey in my cup
You're the memories I'm drinkin', you're the thoughts I'm always thinkin', girl
It don't matter how far I run, you're the one that I can't run from
Used to be my late nights, loved me 'til the daylights
Now you're just my sunrise, you keep comin' up
Yeah, you keep comin' up, up
You keep comin', yeah, you keep comin'
Yeah, you keep comin' up, up
You keep comin', you keep comin'
[Bridge]
There ain't no blinds to close, covers to throw over my head
Ever since you left
[Chorus]
You're my sunrise, you keep comin' up
You're in every conversation, every smoky situation
If it's water, if it's whiskey in my cup
You're the memories I'm drinkin', you're the thoughts I'm always thinkin', girl
It don't matter how far I run, you're the one that I can't run from
Used to be my late nights, loved me 'til the daylights
Now you're just my sunrise, you keep comin' up
Yeah, you keep comin' up, up
You keep comin', yeah, you keep comin'
Yeah, you keep comin' up
