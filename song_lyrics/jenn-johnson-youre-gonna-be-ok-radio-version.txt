[Verse 1]
I know it's all you've got to just be strong
And it's a fight just to keep it together, together
I know you think that you are too far gone
But hope is never lost
Hope is never lost
[Pre-Chorus]
Hold on, don't let go
Hold on, don't let go
[Chorus]
Just take one step closer
Put one foot in front of the other
You'll get through this
Just follow the light in the darkness
You're gonna be ok
[Verse 2]
I know your heart is heavy from those nights
Just remember that you're a fighter, a fighter
You never know just what tomorrow holds
And you're stronger than you know
Stronger than you know
[Pre-Chorus]
Hold on, don't let go
Hold on, don't let go[Chorus]
Just take one step closer
Put one foot in front of the other
You'll get through this
Just follow the light in the darkness
One step closer
Put one foot in front of the other
You'll get through this
Just follow the light in the darkness
You're gonna be ok
[Bridge]
And when the night is closing in
Don't give up and don't give in
This won't last, it's not the end
It's not the end
You're gonna be ok
When the night is closing in
Don't give up and don't give in
This won't last, it's not the end
It's not the end
You're gonna be ok
