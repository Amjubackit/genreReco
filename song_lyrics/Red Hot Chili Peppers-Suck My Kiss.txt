[Intro]
And I'm sailin', yeah
Yeah, oh yeah
Yeah... oh yeah
Hit me!
[Verse 1]
Shoulda been, coulda been, woulda been dead
If I didn't get the message goin' to my head
I am what I am
Most motherfuckers don't give a damn
Oh, baby, think you can
Be my girl, I'll be your man
Someone full of fun do me 'til I'm well done
Little Bo Peep cummin' from my stun gun
Beware, take care
Most motherfuckers have a cold ass stare
Oh, baby, please be there
Suck my kiss, cut me my share
[Chorus 1]
Hit me, you can't hurt me, suck my kiss
Kiss me, please pervert me, stick with this
Is she talking dirty?
Give to me sweet sacred bliss, your mouth was made to suck my kiss
