[Verse 1]
He has walked upon the open waters
The sea was calm with just a word from Him
He has fought the raging war of sorrow
When He speaks, a whisper shouts within
[Chorus]
I see a miracle in an empty grave
The One we though was dead has come to life again
I see a miracle in every chain You break
The power of heaven roaring within me
[Verse 2]
He will lift the anxious and the weary
Calling home the burdened and the lost
I am proof that You delight in second chances
I am proof of the power in the cross
[Chorus]
I see a miracle in an empty grave
The One we though was dead has come to life again
I see a miracle in every chain You break
The power of heaven roaring within me
[Bridge]
All for love, You rose triumphant
All for love, You are
All for love, You came back for me
All for love, all for love
All for love, my name is worthy
All for love, You've come
All for love, Your scars cried mercy
All for love, all for love[Verse 3]
Jesus Christ, passion in His name
He traded all His glory for our shame
Like He rose in freedom from the ashes
We will rise from death to life again
[Chorus]
I see a miracle in an empty grave
The One we though was dead has come to life again
I see a miracle in every chain You break
The power of heaven roaring within me
[Outro]
I see a miracle, oh
I see a miracle, oh
I see a miracle, oh
The power of heaven roaring within me
