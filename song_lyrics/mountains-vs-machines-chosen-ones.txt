We are, We are the chosen
We are, We are the few
The end will never come, (Will never come)
We are the chosen ones
We're the thunder shaking your sky
Burning sun waking up the night
On top of the mountain
Bullet plume shooting through the clouds
Flying up never coming down
Living electric
(oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh)
We are, We are the chosen
We are, We are the truth
The end will never come
We are the chosen ones
We are, We are the chosen
We are, We are the few
The end will never come
We are the chosen ones
In a flash you'll be in the dark
Ice cold looking for a spark
It's too late to fight fate
We won't run from our destiny
We'll fight through
Leave a legacy
Nothing can stop usWe are, We are the chosen
We are, We are the truth
The end will never come
We are the chosen ones
We are, We are the chosen
We are, We are the few
The end will never come
We are the chosen ones
(We are the chosen ones)
We are the chosen ones
We are, We are the chosen
We are, We are the truth
The end will never come
We are the chosen ones
We are, We are the chosen
We are, We are the few
The end will never come
We are the chosen ones
We are the chosen ones
We are we are
We are we are
We are we are
We are the chosen ones
