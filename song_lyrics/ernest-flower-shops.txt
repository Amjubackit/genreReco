[Verse 1: ERNEST]
It's a beautiful day, she's been crying all night
Ah, there's tears in her blue, bloodshot in mine
This bender's been bending, it's hellbound to break
My baby's had all she can take
[Chorus: ERNEST]
Mister, I'll take your roses
If you cut off the thorns, she can't take no more
I'll buy violets and daisies to hide all the crazy
It's gonna take all you've got
Ah, it's a bad day for love
But a good day for flower shops
[Verse 2: Morgan Wallen]
Well, I took some pills and she took the dogs
Ah, it's all gone to hell, she's gone to her mom's
And I took up drinkin' since she took the time
To tell me I took the best years of her life
[Chorus: Morgan Wallen]
So buddy, I'll take your roses
If you cut off the thorns, she can't take no more
I'll buy violets and daisies to hide all the crazy
It's gonna take all you got
It's a tough day for love
But a good day for flower shops[Bridge: ERNEST and 
ERNEST & Morgan Wallen
]
Roses are red, violets are blue
I don't need one, I need one million to
 get you
[Chorus: ERNEST, 
Morgan Wallen
, 
Both

So mister, I'll take your roses
If you cut off the thorns, she can't take no more
I'll buy violets and daisies to get back my baby
It's gonna take all you've got
Ah, it's a bad day for love
But a good day for flower shops
