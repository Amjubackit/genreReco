[Refrain: The Alan Parsons Project]
The sun in your eyes while all of the lies worth
The sun in your eyes made some of the lies worth
The sun in your eyes made all of the lies worth
The sun in your eyes made some of the lies worth
The sun in your eyes while all of the lies worth
The sun in your eyes made some of the lies worth
The sun in your eyes madе all of the lies worth
The sun in your еyes
[Verse 1: Leon Bridges]
Follow the light
Hold it in your hand
Our love belongs among the stars
Expanding from within
See them collide
Feel it all begin
Our souls belong among the stars
Our bodies can't hold it in
[Verse 2: Leon Bridges]
Spirit guide
Love provides
Spirit guide, spirit need
Love provides all that we need
