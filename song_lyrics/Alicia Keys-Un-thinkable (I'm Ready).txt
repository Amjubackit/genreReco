[Verse 1]
Moment of honesty
Someone's gotta take the lead tonight
Who's it gonna be?
I'm gonna sit right here and tell you all that comes to me
If you have somethin' to say, you should say it right now
(You should say it right now)
[Pre-Chorus]
You give me a feeling that I never felt before
And I deserve it, I think I deserve it
It's becoming something that's impossible to ignore
And I can't take it
[Chorus]
I was wonderin', maybe, could I make you my baby?
If we do the unthinkable, would it make us look crazy?
If you ask me, I'm ready (I'm ready)
If you ask me, I'm ready (I'm ready)
[Verse 2]
I know you said to me
"This is exactly how it should feel when it's meant to be
Time is only wasting, so why wait for eventually?"
If we gon' do somethin' 'bout it, we should do it right now
(We should do it right now)
