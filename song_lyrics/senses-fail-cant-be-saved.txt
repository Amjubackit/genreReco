[Instrumental Intro]
[Verse 1]
"Follow your bliss," it reads on my chest
I know I got it tattooed for a reason, 
why can't I just hold it true?
'Cause I'm still crashing all the funerals
Of these people that I never knew, yeah!
[Chorus]
I'm stuck in a coma, stuck in a never-ending sleep
And someday I will wake up and realize I made up everything
[Verse 2]
I shut the door and turn all the lights out
And listen to all the songs that the night shouts
They go something just like this
So, go fill up a glass with 
tonic, rocks, and gin
And drink yourself to happiness
[Chorus]
I'm stuck in a coma, stuck in a never-ending sleep
And someday I will wake up and realize I made up everything
[Bridge]
We cannot hang ourselves from gold chandeliers
And drink goodbye to all, all the pain and fears
Loose lips have sunk this ship to a shallow grave
Washed up upon the rocks, 
I won't be saved, I won't be saved![Chorus]
I'm stuck in a coma, stuck in a never-ending sleep
And someday I will wake up and realize I gave up everything
[Outro]
(I won't be saved) So "follow your bliss," it reads on my chest
(I won't be saved) I know I got it tattooed for a reason
(I won't be saved) I shut the door and turn all the lights out
(I won't be saved) And listen to all the songs that the night shouts
