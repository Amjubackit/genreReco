[Verse 1]
Venus in retrograde
Cutting my soul with the razor blade
Innocent, so sweet
Poison my brain and my bloodstream
Heaven can you save me?
Sex and candy with my baby
California cool with high heels on
[Chorus]
She’s my little Yoko oh no
Makes me go loco
Tell me something that I don't know
She’s my little Yoko oh no
Fuck me up in slow mo
Put my body in a chokehold
Oh no
[Verse 2]
Ice queen, so mean
Why she always wanna fight me, spite me?
And if I try to get away you can find me in the loneliest place
And if I try to catch a break you can find me falling on my face
[Chorus]
She’s my little Yoko oh no
Makes me go loco
Tell me something that I don't know
She’s my little Yoko oh no
Fuck me up in slow mo
Put my body in a chokehold
Oh no[Bridge]
She’s my little Yoko
(Tell me something that I don't know)
She’s my little Yoko
(Put my body in a chokehold)
She’s my little Yoko
[Chorus]
She’s my little Yoko oh no
Makes me go loco
Tell me something that I don't know
She’s my little Yoko oh no
Fuck me up in slow mo
Put my body in a chokehold
Oh no
