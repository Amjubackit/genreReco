[Verse 1]
Just run it back, give me five whole minutes, I am
Thick tar on the inside burning
I've got a ghost in the hallway grinning
 and a
Heavy head that won't stop turning
If my fate is a bad collision, and if
My mind is an open highway
Give me the twilight two-way vision
Give me one last ride on a sunset sky lane
[Refrain]
Call me when you get the chance
I can feel the walls around me closing in
[Verse 2]
Just running forwards, a life like wires as I
See the past on an empty ceiling
I play along with the life signs anyway but
Hope to God you don't know this feeling
Yet in reverse you are all my symmetry
A parallel I would lay my life on
So if your wings won't find you heaven
I will bring it down
 like an ancient bygone
[Refrain]
Call me when you have the time
I just need to leave this part of me behind[Verse 3]
Do you remember me
When the rain gathers?
And do you still believe
That nothing else matters?
For me
It's still the autumn leaves
These ancient canopies
That we used to lay beneath
No, by now
The night belongs to you
This bough has broken through
I must be someone new
[Bridge]
No, for me

The whites of your eyes
Turn black in the lowlight
In turning divine
We tangle endlessly
Like lovers entwined
I know for the last time
You will not be mine
So give me the night, the night, the night
