[Verse 1: Point North]
It's been quiet in my mind
Now I'm paranoid
It's just a matter of time before it's making noise
It's like an hourglass I can't turn over
And when it's out, it comes down like a mortar
[Pre-Chorus: Point North]
I know you think I'm always in control
But it's hard for me to let things go
There's nothing left to talk about
Now you got me thinking how
[Chorus: Point North]
I've been getting bad news, all night
Swinging in a safe place, that's where I try
You'll never get a chance to rewind
You say that you care but don't
I need an antidote
When safe and sound comes burning down
I've been getting bad news, all night
Letting go of high hopes that just died (Die)
[Verse 2: Point North]
You seem to love it whеn you drag me down
You're concretе on my feet, I drown
Yeah, breathing's kinda hard
'Cause I'm sinking in the dark
And you're not gonna pull me out
[Pre-Chorus: Point North]
I know you think I'm always in control
But it's hard for me to let things go
There's nothing left to talk about
Now you got me thinking how
[Chorus: Point North]
I've been getting bad news, all night
Swinging in a safe place, that's where I try
You'll never get a chance to rewind
You say that you care but don't
I need an antidote
When safe and sound comes burning down
I've been getting bad news, all night
Letting go of high hopes that just died
[Verse 3: The Ghost Inside]
I'm watching where I walk
Touching every aftershock
From the heavy steps you take
I'm set with reign, I need a victory
For in the ways of revival, will be
For in the way to the shots I received
For in the way for the fresher debris
Everything that secrets revealed
Has just died for us to reach
[Refrain: Point North]
When safe and sound comes burning down
I've been getting bad news, all night
Letting go of high hopes
[Chorus: Point North, The Ghost Inside, Both]
I've been getting bad news, all night
Swinging in a safe place, that's where I try
You'll never get a chance to rewind
You say that you care but don't
I need an antidote
When safe and sound comes burning down
I've been getting bad news (Bad news!), all night (All night!)
Letting go of high hopes that just died (Die!)
[Bridge: The Ghost Inside]
For in the way for the fresher debris
Everything that secrets revealed
Has just died for us to reach
