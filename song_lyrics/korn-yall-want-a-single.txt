[Chorus]
Y'all want a single say fuck that!
Fuck that, fuck that!
Y'all want a single say fuck that!
Fuck that, fuck that!
Y'all want a single say fuck that!
Fuck that, fuck that!
Y'all want a single say fuck that!
Boom, boom, boom, boom!
[Verse 1]
What's going on today?
We gotta break away
We got a problem
And I think it's gonna make us go down
They think we're all the same
And always we're to blame
For shit I think is lame
It's time to stop the game
I think it's time to pay
For everything you made me say
[Chorus]
Y'all want a single, say fuck that!
Fuck that, fuck that!
Y'all want a single, say fuck that!
Fuck that, fuck that!
Y'all want a single, say fuck that!
Fuck that, fuck that!
Y'all want a single, say fuck that!
Fuck that, fuck that!
