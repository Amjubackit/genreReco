Where did we go wrong?
Now won't you tell me what went wrong with love
And maybe we could fix it.  (What's wrong between us?)
Where did we go wrong?
Now won't you tell me what went wrong with love
It doesn't matter who is right or wrong
It doesn't matter who's to blame
But we both have to swallow our pride to make this love strong
Oooh, baby
And we can conquer anything, hey baby
Together, together, together, together
And if our love was meant to be, oh girl
We'll find a way to save it.  (We're gonna find a way to save it.)
We'll build a road of love, baby
Where did we go wrong?
Now won't you tell me what went wrong with love
And maybe we could fix it.  (What's wrong between us?)
Where did we go wrong?
Now won't you tell me what went wrong with love
I had a lot of sleepless nights with this crisis on my mind
Spinning 'round in my mind.  (Spinning 'round in my mind)
Searching deep within to try to make it right with you and me
We can patch it up again, oh baby
Together, together, together, together
If our love was meant to be, hey baby
We'll find a way to save it.  (We're gonna find a way to save it.)
We'll build a road of love, baby
Find a way to save it.  (We're gonna find a way to save it.)
We'll build a road of love, baby
Find a way to save it.  (We're gonna find a way to save it.)
We'll build a road of love, baby
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, eh, eh, eh.  (Where did we go wrong?)
With love and maybe we could fix it.  (What's wrong between us?)
(Where did we go wrong?) Girl, tell me what went wrong with love
And maybe we could fix it, baby.  (What's wrong between us?)
Ooooooh....(Where did we go wrong?)
Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
Tell your baby, (What's wrong between us?)
Tell your baby what went wrong with love
(Where did we go wrong?) Hey, hey, maybe we can work it out
Work it out
(What's wrong between us?) We, we, we can work it out, baby
Where did we go wrong
Oh, can you tell your baby what went wrong with love
(What's wrong between us?)
