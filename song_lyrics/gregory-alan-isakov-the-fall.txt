[Intro]
The fall, the fall, the fall
I keep stumbling back
[Verse]
Ivory bone opera glass
Angles of attack
You heard blood was thick, brothers and sisters
But ya don't know where anybody's at
Time was a bust
You thought you'd better be tough
Nobody gets past
The trembling wire
[Chorus]
And all eyes on you now, on you
We're all holding our breath
(The fall) All eyes on you now, on you
We're still holding our breath
[Bridge]
We all break a little
We all break a little
We all break a little, when we fall
And evеrybody keeps saying, "Get up, get up"[Outro]
The fall, thе fall, the fall, mm-mmh
"Go on, get up"
The fall, the fall, the fall, mm-mmh
