[Intro]
It's 7 A.M. and I'm on a mountain with a view
I'm the only one, alone, at a table meant for two
Big Sur looks beautiful this morning
And I should be missin' you, I should be missin' you
[Verse 1]
You're across the pond at a show, I think, in Amsterdam
And the pictures look pretty, at least they do on your Instagram
We say good morning, then goodnight
I wonder if you even know where I am, where I am
[Chorus]
I'm wearin' the ring still, but I think I'm lyin'
Sometimes you forget yours, I think we're done tryin'
I realize you loved me much more at twenty-three
I think that this is when it's over for me
[Post-Chorus]
Uh, uh
Uh, uh
[Verse 2]
I can't believe I'm a few months out from 
twenty-nine
I can't handle another year of you and I just bein' fine
I've shared all my secrets, and I've paid for all my crimes
And our stars ain't fallin' back into line
