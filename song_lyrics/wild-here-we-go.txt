[Verse 1]
Diving in
While the currents fast
Gotta leave the past, it's in the past
Yeah, I won't look back
[Verse 2]
Strike a match
Watch the flames go higher
We can burn much brighter
If we don't look back
[Pre–Chorus 1]
What does it take
To leave it all behind?
We'll see it happen
One step at a time
[Chorus]
Here we go, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
And we're never slowing down, darling
Here we go, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
We got lost until we're found, darling
Here we go
[Verse 3]
Feel the blood
Rushing through my veins
Got some brand new wings
No, we won't go back[Pre–Chorus 2]
What does it take
To make our dreams collide?
The smallest change
Can make you feel alive
[Chorus]
Here we go, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
And we're never slowing down, darling
Here we go, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
We got lost until we're found, darling
Here we go
[Bridge]
What does it take to feel this alive?
Everyday, we're going to try
What does it take to feel this alive?
Chase down our fears till they're forced to hide
What does it take to feel this alive?
Everyday, we're going to try
[Chorus]
Here we go, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
And we're never slowing down, darling
Here we go, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh[Outro]
And we're never slowing down
No, we're never slowing down
We got lost until we're found
No, we're never slowing down, darling
Here we go
