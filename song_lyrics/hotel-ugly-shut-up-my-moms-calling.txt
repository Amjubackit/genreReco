[Hook]
I just want to rewind I haven't seen you in a long time
You got me feeling so lonely
Even when you come through I can tell
That it isn't you so baby, bring it in closely
Hate the way I love you but you so sweet
I always find a way to say the wrong things
I wish that we were laying in the same sheets
But lately you've been acting like you hardly know me
[Chorus]
Baby come home, home (So baby, won't you say some)
Baby come home, home
Baby come home, home (So baby, won't you say some)
Baby come home, home (So baby, won't you say some)
[Hook]
I just want to rewind I haven't seen you in a long time
You got me feeling so lonely
Even when you come through I can tell
That it isn't you so baby bring it in closely
Hate the way I love you but you so sweet
I always find a way to say the wrong things
I wish that we were laying in the same sheets
But lately you've been acting like you hardly know me[Verse]
I've only recently begun to fall
I feel the need to go and waste it all
I tried to numb away the pain
I hope someone is watching me, watching me, watching me
[Chorus]
Baby come home, home (So baby, won't you say some)
Baby come home, home
Baby come home, home (So baby, won't you say some)
Baby come home, home
