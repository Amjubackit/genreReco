[Chorus]
I woke up in my boots this morning
Fell asleep in my boots last night
Had a feeling that I'd run out of warnings
Girl, I couldn't have been more right
[Verse 1]
My only suitcase, it's by the front door
That look on your face says you don't want me no more
There's no use in talking
This time you mean it
You're sending me walking
Well what a convenience 'cause
[Chorus]
I woke up in my boots this morning
Fell asleep in my boots last night
Had a feeling that I'd run out of warnings
Girl, I couldn't have been more right
[Post-Chorus]
And I knew I wouldn’t have to take the time putting em back on when I’m sober
Yeah, I knew you’d be pissed off over me and I’d just be hungover
Girl, I knew I’d open my eyes in a house fit for a dog
Knew I’d need 'em come the daylight so I didn’t even take 'em off, nah
I woke up in my boots this morning[Verse 2]
Yeah, we were past the point of fighting
There'd be a curb you’d kick me to
I made it easy on me, girl, but I made it easier on you
Can't hide the truth, yeah, we both knew that it was coming
So I woke up in my boots this morning
I woke up in my boots this morning
[Chorus]
I woke up in my boots this morning
'Cause I went out and got drunk last night
Had a feeling that I'd run out of warnings so I
Said what the hell and kissed us goodbye
[Post-Chorus]
And I knew I wouldn’t have to take the time putting 'em back on when I'm sober
Yeah, I knew you'd be pissed off over me and I'd just be hungover
Girl, I knew I'd open my eyes in a house fit for a dog
Knew I'd need 'em come the daylight so I didn't even take 'em off, no
No, I didn't even take 'em off, no
I woke up in my boots this morning
Yeah, I woke up in my boots this morning
