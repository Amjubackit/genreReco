[Verse 1]
Dive in, take a breath
Blow the smoke through the hole in my chest
Still choking on the bed
Found your waste while the ember red keeps falling down and burning holes
Until the pillow and the mattress glow
Now I wanna be the tattoo ink that swims down through the needle in your skin
And I wish I was poisonous
Like a bottomless sound, like a violent drug
Do you remember the knife I kept?
The sharper it got, the more you wanted me to use it
I was lying to you, but you were lying too
So what's left to do?
What's left to say?
Stop making friends, just us
I'll decompose with you
So light the fuse inside your brain and we-
We will detonate
[Verse 2]
You threw your drink at the wall
It started raining wine and glass so
Stay and warm me with the Gentlemen Jack
Gold locks on the cage
Turn your diamond keys
Open the door you'll see me digging out my getaway
(Away, away, away)
Hang the stars
Who pulled the pin out of my heart?[Chorus]
And just because you're screaming for my attention
Does not mean I will waste my time
So hold your breath and swim under the ice
[Verse 3]
And modern anxiety
That motherfucker never rests
Our adrenaline is kickin' in so play the beat faster
Head for the streets
We're the puke and decay
We're only dreaming, what's your problem baby?
Don't mean to break your heart
I'm the new fragrance in fermented jars
In area code 666, oh
[Chorus]
And just because you're screaming for my attention
Does not mean I will waste my time
So hold your breath and learn how to swim underneath the ice
[Bridge]
They're everywhere
Nothing
 can stop them
Nothing![Breakdown]
Kill me if I end up like you
[Chorus]
And just because you're screaming for my attention
Does not mean I will waste my time
So hold your breath and swim under the ice
[Outro]
I know that it's not safe here
You did this to yourself but have no fear
Just hold your breath and swim under
