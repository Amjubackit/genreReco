[Verse 1]
One of these days, I'm gonna take mine back
I fell forever just to watch the slack
All of the days of working in the sun
My hands remind me of every hole I dug
[Pre-Chorus 1]
I said, hey, I'm all cried out
Hey, I'm all tired out
You'll climb out
When you're finding your own way
[Chorus]
I'll say it louder, say it clear
I'll say it louder, say it clear
I'll say it louder, say it clear
I'll say it louder, say it clear
They say sometimes
What you need is exactly what you fear
[Verse 2]
One of these days, I'll take it on my way
One of these nights, I'll leave it somewhere babe
Talk of days and night and what you want
You say forever, then it's way too long
[Pre-Chorus 2]
I said hey, hey baby
The night's turned to dawn and we're standing
In the shadows baby
Where we turn to face the sun
[Chorus]
I'll say it louder, say it clear
I'll say it louder, say it clear
I'll say it louder, say it clear
I'll say it louder, say it clear
[Pre-Chorus 1]
I said, hey, I'm all cried out
Hey, I'm all tired out
And you'll climb out
When you're finding your way
[Chorus]
I'll say it louder, say it clear
I'll say it louder, say it clear
I'll say it louder, say it clear
I'll say it louder, say it clear
They say sometimes
What you need is exactly what you fear
