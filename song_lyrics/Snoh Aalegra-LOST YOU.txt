[Verse 1]
Didn't know that love could change ya
Then I woke up to a stranger
After all this time, I thought that I knew
You and I was no debating
Now it's up for conversation
Tell me, was it all a lie? I'm confused, mm
[Pre-Chorus]
But then you say what I wanna hear
'Cause you know it's gon' get me here
Every time I say that I'm through
And even though I know it ain't right
Said I wasn't gon' spend the night
Here I am, right back with you
[Chorus]
Although I lost you
I, I'll always want you
'Cause you take me high (High)
See, I'll always want you
But I know I've lost you
[Post-Chorus]
Say it, right (Right)
(Oh-ooh-ah)
