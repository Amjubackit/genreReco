[Verse]
Comin' out of my cage and I've been doin' just fine
Gotta, gotta be down because I want it all
It started out with a kiss, how did it end up like this?
It was only a kiss, it was only a kiss
Now I'm fallin' asleep and she's calling a cab
While he's having a smoke and she's takin' a drag
Now they're goin' to bed, and my stomach is sick
And it's all in my head, but she's touching his
[Pre-Chorus]
Chest now, he takes off her dress now
Let me go
And I just can't look, it's killing me
They're taking control
[Chorus]
Jealousy, turning saints into the sea
Swimming through sick lullabies, choking on your alibis
But it's just the price I pay, destiny is calling me
Open up my eager eyes, 'cause I'm Mr. Brightside
[Instrumental Bridge]

I'm comin' out of my cage, and I've been doin' just fine
Gotta, gotta be down because I want it all
It started out with a kiss, how did it end up like this?
(It was only a kiss) It was only a kiss
Now I'm falling asleep and she's calling a cab
While he's havin' a smoke and she's takin' a drag
Now they're goin' to bed, and my stomach is sick
And it's all in my head, but she's touching his
[Pre-Chorus]
Chest now, he takes off her dress now
Let me go
'Cause I just can't look, it's killing me
They're taking control

Swimming through sick lullabies, choking on your alibis
But it's just the price I pay, destiny is calling me

[Outro]
I never
I never
I never
I never
