[Verse]
Doubled down on that pink molly, now I'm peaking, yeah
Doubled down on that pink molly so I’m peaking, yeah
I put my wrist up for some water, now it's freezing, yeah
I'm riding cross witness, stunting for my demons, yeah
She said I’m pussy, I like louder, so I need it, yeah
I let my dogs out from they leash, this ain't no kennel, yeah
Yeah, finna mix some codeine with the mix
Aim at your top, fuck a 'Vette
Put holes in your body like mesh
Lately I feel like that nigga, I'm finna say it with my chest
I'm rolling up medical zaza, that how I deal with my stress
[Chorus]
I get geeked off molly, I float out my body
I put my opp inside my blunt, that mean I caught that body
I get geeked off molly, I float out my body
I put my opp inside my blunt, that mean I caught that body (Slatt)
[Verse]
Doubled down on that pink molly so I'm peaking, yeah
I put my wrist up for some water, now it's freezing, yeah
I'm riding cross witness, stunting for my demons, yeah
She said I’m pussy, I like louder, so I need it, yeah
I let my dogs out from they leash, this ain’t no kennel, yeah
Yeah, finna mix some codeine with the mix
Aim at your top, fuck a 'Vette
Put holes in your body like mesh
Lately I feel like that nigga, I’m finna say it with my chest (Hol' on)
[Outro]
I get geeked off molly, I float out my body
I put my opp inside my blunt, that mean I caught that body
I get geeked off molly, I float out my body
I put my opp inside my blunt, that mean I caught that body
