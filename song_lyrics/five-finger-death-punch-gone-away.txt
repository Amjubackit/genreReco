[Verse 1]
Maybe in another life
I could find you there
Pulled away before your time
I can't deal, it's so unfair
[Chorus]
And it feels
And it feels like
Heaven's so far away
And it feels
Yeah, it feels like
The world has grown cold
Now that you've gone away
[Verse 2]
Leaving flowers on your grave
Show that I still care
Black roses and Hail Marys
I can't bring back what's taken from me
[Pre-Chorus]
I reach to the sky
And call out your name
Oh, please let me trade
I would[Chorus]
And it feels
And it feels like
Heaven's so far away
And it stings
Yeah, it stings now
The world is so cold
Now that you've gone away
[Post-Chorus]
Gone away
Gone away
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
[Instrumental Break]
[Pre-Chorus]
I reach to the sky
And call out your name
Oh, please let me trade
I would
[Refrain]
And it feels
Yeah, it feels like
Heaven's so far away[Chorus]
And it feels
Yeah, it feels like
Heaven's so far away
And it stings
Yeah, it stings now
The world is so cold
Now that you've gone away
[Post-Chorus]
Gone away
Gone away
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah
Oh, yeah, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Yeah-oh, yeah, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
[Outro]
And it feels
And it feels like
The world is so cold
Now that you've gone away
