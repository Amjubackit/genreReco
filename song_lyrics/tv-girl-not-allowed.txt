[Intro: Yeastie Girlz]
Now you suck
We wanna talk about sex but we're not allowed
Well, you may not like it but you better learn how 'cause it's your turn now
You're wasting your tongue with lame excuses and lies
Now, what's on your nasty old mind?
[Verse 1: TV Girl]
So how should I begin this?
I guess it started when you were with him
And how he never even took you out to dance
But did he fuck with any rhythm?
But now he's playing with your head
But did he ever make you cum?
Did he ever make you cry?
Do the wires in your mind get sewn together?
Rubbed and severed by the heat
You don't know how long I could stare into your picture
And wish that it was me
I guess it's different 'cause you love him
But I've got an interactive
Sick and twisted imagination
And that's gotta count for something
[Chorus: Yeastie Girlz]
We wanna talk about sex but we're not allowed
Well, you may not like it but you'd better learn how 'cause it's your turn now
You're wasting your tongue with lame excuses and lies
Get your face between my thighs
