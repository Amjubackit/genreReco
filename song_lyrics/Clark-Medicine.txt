[Verse 1: Clark]
And I'm caught off guard
From hello onwards with you
Cold in the blue light
Clock in your mind
Snatch the broken moment
Numb feet tap tappin'
And you're shovelling it down
Breathe until you don't
You until you're not
Satisfied crawling upside down
And these thoughts are not yours
And it's moving the lasers
A rest is as good as it gets
And it's a good one
Peaches and cream
And the sunshine is mute
And the river is slow today
And we dive in whirling
[Chorus: Clark]
How can I contain
Why do you control
[Verse 2: Thom Yorke]
I know you wanna say more than you can
I know you wanna speak
But something inside won't let you
Sneaky kick
On your way out of the garden
The insects are oblivious
As th–µ medicine floods your veins
