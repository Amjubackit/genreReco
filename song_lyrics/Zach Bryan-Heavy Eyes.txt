[Verse 1]
Remember when David dashed a twelve-pack
Of Budweiser Heavy for the road?
Two kids in the back, drunk off their ass
Screamin' in an old Bronco
[Chorus]
And I recall what she said
That she wanted me dead
There ain't no grave deep enough
Remember all the nights we had
You said it ain't so bad
Just keep those heavy eyes lookin' up
[Verse 2]
Remember when Mary brought her own Jane?
Lucas thought he was gonna die
'Cause stars started fallin' out a night cloud
From a clear, midwestern sky
[Chorus]
I recall what she said
Screamin' that the sky's red
It's burned into a younger man's mind
Remember all the days we had
I say it ain't so bad
Keep those heavy eyes soft and kind
