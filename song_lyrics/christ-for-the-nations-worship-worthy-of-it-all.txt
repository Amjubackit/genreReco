[Verse]
All the saints and angels bow before Your throne
All the elders cast their crowns before the Lamb of God and sing
All the saints and angels, they bow before Your throne
All the elders cast their crowns before the Lamb of God and sing
[Chorus]
You are worthy of it all
You are worthy of it all
For from You are all things
And to You are all things
You deserve the glory
You are worthy, You alone
[Verse]
All the saints and angels bow before Your throne
All the elders cast their crowns before the Lamb of God and sing

And to You are all things
You deserve the glory
Oh yes, You are
You are worthy of it all
You are worthy of it all
For from You are all things
And to You are all things
You deserve the glory
You are worthy of it all
There's no one like You
You are worthy of it all
For from You are all things
And to You are all things
You deserve the glory[Interlude]
