[Verse 1]
Grew up a Mississippi hippie tripping LSD
Smoking stems 'n seeds and drinking mushroom tea
We drinking mushroom tea
We're drinking mushroom tea
Here's to the Mississippi hippies tripping LSD
Yeah, we be up and rolling
Yeah, we be up and rolling
Smoking them things with our friends
Yeah, we be up and rolling
[Verse 2]
Extension cords out the window of RL's single-wide
Singing through a Peavey, sounding good outside
He's sounding good outside
Yeah, cords out the window of RL's single-wide
Yeah, we be up and rolling
Yeah, we be up and rolling
Singing the blues with our friends
Yeah, we be up and rolling
[Verse 3]
We love to play these hill country blues 'til you satisfied
We out on the road, Lord knows, we all love to ride
Yeah, we love to ride
We never satisfied
We out on the road but our home's the hilly countryside
The hills be up and rolling
Yeah, we be up and rolling
Out in the streets with our friends
Yeah, we be up and rolling[Verse 1]
Grew up a Mississippi hippie tripping LSD
Smoking stems 'n seeds and drinking mushroom tea
Drinking mushroom tea
We're drinking mushroom tea
Here's to the Mississippi hippies tripping LSD
Yeah, we be up and rolling
Yeah, we be up and rolling
Smoking them things with our friends
Yeah, old school representin'
[Outro]

Yeah, we be up and rolling
Yeah, we be up and rolling
