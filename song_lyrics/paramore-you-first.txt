[Verse 1]
Living well is not my kind of revenge
You should take it from me
Living well is just a privilege
Thought I'd simmer down as I got older
Can't shake the devil sitting on my shoulder
Who invited you?
[Pre-Chorus]
Just like a stray animal
I keep feeding scraps
I give it my energy
And it keeps on coming back
But just like a stray animal
I keep feeding scraps
I give it my energy
And it keeps on coming
[Chorus]
Everyone is a bad guy
And there's no way to, no way to know
Who's the worst
Karma's gonna come for all of us
And I hope, well, I hope, I just hope
She comes, comes for you first, oh
