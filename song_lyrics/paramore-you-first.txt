[Verse 1]
Living well is not my kind of revenge
You should take it from me
Living well is just a privilege
Thought I'd simmer down as I got older
Can't shake the devil sitting on my shoulder
Who invited you?
[Pre-Chorus]
Just like a stray animal
I keep feeding scraps
I give it my energy
And it keeps on coming back
But just like a stray animal
I keep feeding scraps
I give it my energy
And it keeps on coming
[Chorus]
Everyone is a bad guy
And there's no way to, no way to know
Who's the worst
Karma's gonna come for all of us
And I hope, well, I hope, I just hope
She comes, comes for you first, oh
[Verse 2]
Which wolf wins?
I guess it really depends, just gotta wait and see
Which one's appеtite's the biggest
Turns out I'm livin' in a horror film
Whеre I'm both the killer and the final girl
So who, who are you?
[Pre-Chorus]
Just like a stray animal
I keep feeding scraps
I give it my energy
And it keeps on coming back
But just like a stray animal
I keep feeding scraps
I give it my energy
And it keeps on coming
[Chorus]
Everyone is a bad guy
And there's no way to, no way to know
Who's the worst
'Cause karma's gonna come for all of us
And I hope, well, I hope, I just hope
She comes, comes for you first, oh
[Bridge]
Never said I wasn't petty
Never said I wasn't petty
I never said I wasn't petty
You can bet I don't regret it for a second
It's a pleasure, it's a reckoning
Never said I wasn't petty
I'll do better when you're better
Let me revel in your defeat
[Chorus]
Everyone is a bad guy
And there's no way to, no way to know
Who's the worst
But karma's gonna come for all of us
And I hope, well, I hope, I just hope
She comes, comes for you first, oh
