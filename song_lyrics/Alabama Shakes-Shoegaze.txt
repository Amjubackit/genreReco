[Verse 1]
Can't wait for night to come
That's when the fun really begins
My band cools off when that day is done
And then I tuck myself in
[Chorus]
It ain't no fun to be alone, yeah
But I was not too lonely
And I begin to realize that
I can't have everything, everything
Why can't I?
[Verse 2]
Let's go make memories
Precious and temporary
Of all the people I meet
I want to take you all with me
[Chorus]
It ain't no fun to be alone, well
But I was not too lonely
And I begin to realize that
Well, I can't have everything, everything
Oh, why can't I?
Or do I?
