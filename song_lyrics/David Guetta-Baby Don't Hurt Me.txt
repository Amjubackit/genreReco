[Verse 1: Anne-Marie]
I want you for the dirty and clean
When you're wakin' in your dreams
When you bite my tongue and make me scream (And make me scream)
See, I got everything that you need
Ain't nobody gon' do it like me
We are burnin' at a high degree (Burnin' at a high degree)
[Pre-Chorus: Anne-Marie]
And you make me feel like it burns
And it hurts, uh
Maybe that's part of the rush
This is us
[Chorus: Anne-Marie]
What is love?
Baby, don't hurt me
Don't hurt me no more
What is love?
Baby, don't hurt me
Don't hurt me no more
[Drop: Anne-Marie, 
Coi Leray

What is love?
What is love?
Yeah, yeah, uh-huh
