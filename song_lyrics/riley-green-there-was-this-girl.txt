[Verse 1]
Never knew my old man's truck could even run like that
Should've known better than to take that curve so fast
Daddy pulled up, I was down in a ditch
And he asked me why I did what I did
[Chorus]
There was this girl, drink in her hand
Shootin' me a "Let's get into trouble" grin
I ain't never seen somethin' so fine
And I was doin' anything to make her mine
I was out of my mind, she was out of this world
There was this girl
[Verse 2]
Some folks ask me why I still pick this guitar
They say livin' that life on the road won't get you very far
I say man you should've been down in Tupelo
Seen what was in the front row
[Chorus]
There was this girl, beer in her hand
Shootin' me a "Play a little Skynyrd" grin
She's turnin' it up, she's turnin' me on
And I'd play her anything she'd sing along
I was out of my mind, she was out of this world
There was this girl
Yeah, there was this girl
