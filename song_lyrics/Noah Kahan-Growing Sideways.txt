[Verse 1]
So I took my medication and I poured my trauma out
On some sad-eyed, middle-aged man's overpriced new leather couch
And we argued about Jesus, finally found some middle ground
I said, "I'm cured"
[Verse 2]
And I divvied up my 
anger
 into 
thirty separate parts
Keep the bad shit in my liver
 and the rest around my heart
I'm still angry at my parents for what their parents did to them
But it's a 
start
[Pre-Chorus]
But I ignore things and I move sideways
'Til I forget what I felt in the first place
At the end of the day, I know there are worse ways to stay alive
[Chorus]
'Cause everyone's growing and everyone's healthy
I'm terrified that I might never have met me
Oh, if my engine works perfect on empty
I guess I'll drive
I guess I'll drive
[Verse 3]
So I forgot my medication, fell into a manic high
Spent my savings at a Lulu, now I'm sufferin' in style
Why is pain so damn impatient? Ain't like it's got a place to be
Keeps rushin' me
