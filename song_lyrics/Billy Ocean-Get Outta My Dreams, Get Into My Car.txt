[Intro]
Hey you, get in to my car! Who me?
Yes you, get in to my car
Woooooooooh. Wah! Hey
[Verse: 1]
Who's that lady coming down the road
Who's that lady
Who's that woman walking through my door
What's the score
I'll be the sun shining on you
Hey Cinderella step in your shoe
I'll be your non-stop lover
Get it while you can
Your non-stop miracle, I'm your man
[Hook]
Get outta my dreams
Get in to my car
Get outta my dreams
(Get in to the back seat baby)
Get in to my car
(Beep Beep, yeah)
Get outta my mind
Get in to my life
(Ooooooh)
Oh I said hey (Hey) you (You)
Get in to my car
Oh baby
