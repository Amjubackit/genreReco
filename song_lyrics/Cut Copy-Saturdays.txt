[Verse]
When I am looking for you
I call your number
But I can't get through
When I am looking for you
I call your number
But I can't get through
[Verse]
When I am looking for you
I call your number
But I can't get through
When I am looking for you
I call your number
But I can't get through
[Outro]
There is a feeling in me
And I don't know why
Is there a feeling in you
That you can't deny?
There is a feeling in me
And I don't know why
Is there a feeling in you
That you can't deny?
There is a feeling in me
And I don't know why
Is there a feeling in you
That you can't deny?
There is a feeling in me
And I don't know why
Is there a feeling in you
That you can't deny?
There is a feeling in me
And I don't know why
Is there a feeling in you
That you can't deny?
