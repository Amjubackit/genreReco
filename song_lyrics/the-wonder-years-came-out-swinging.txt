[Verse 1]
Moved all my shit into my parent's basement
And out of our old apartment
And I know things changed
But I'm not sure when
I guess you'd call this regression
I left a real job and a girlfriend
Convinced myself that I'm brave enough for all of this, well
I spent a whole year in airports
And the floor feels like home
Oh, at least we're never alone
I lost track of the time zones, I'd call but you know, oh
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm running on empty
And the late nights and the long drives start to get to me
I'm just so tired
[Chorus]
I spent this year as a ghost
And I'm not sure what I'm looking for
A voice on a phone that you rarely answer anymore
I came in here alone, came in here alone
(But that doesn't scare me like it did seven months ago)
I spent this year as a ghost
And I'm not sure where home is anymore[Verse 2]
Been on a steady fast food diet
Like we're this generation's
Morgan Spurlock
 
but we don't admit defeat
My body feels rejected
I can't say that I blame it
My heart keeps saying stay young
My lower back seems to disagree
Unrolled a cheap cotton blanket
On an old dirty couch, oh
I felt the year start to wind down
Can't stand any dead space, empty beds bum me out, oh
[Chorus]
I spent this year as a ghost
And I'm not sure what I'm looking for
A voice on a phone that you rarely answer anymore
I came in here alone, came in here alone
(But that doesn't scare me like it did seven months ago)
I spent this year as a ghost
And I'm not sure where home is anymore
[Outro]
I came out swinging from a
South Philly basement, caked in stale beer and sweat
Under half-lit fluorescents
 
and I
Spent the winter writing songs about getting better
And if I'm being honest, I'm getting thereI came out swinging from a
South Philly basement, caked in stale beer and sweat
Under half-lit fluorescents
 
and I
Spent the winter writing songs about getting better
And if I'm being honest, I'm getting there
I came out swinging from a
South Philly basement, caked in stale beer and sweat
Under half-lit fluorescents
 
and I
Spent the winter writing songs about getting better
Well, if I'm being honest, I'm getting there
