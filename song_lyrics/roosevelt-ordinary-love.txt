[Verse 1]
So easy loving you
So call it what you want
Lost in a memory
Falling back in time
Falling back in time
[Pre-Chorus]
Can't feel it anymore
So what have I become
Feed off your energy
The night is on your side
Night is on your side
[Chorus]
The way you make me feel
No ordinary love
It's never been so real
No ordinary love
No ordinary love
No ordinary love
[Verse 2]
So what you gonna do
Staring at the sun
Another melody
Yeah, you know I tried
Yeah, you know I tried
