[Intro]
Uno, dos, tres
[Verse 1]
It's been a really, really messed up week
Seven days of torture, 
seven days of bitter
And my girlfriend went and cheated on me
She's a California dime, but it's time for me to quit her
[Pre-Chorus]
La, la, la, whatever
La, la, la, it doesn't matter
La, la, la, oh, well
La, la, la
[Chorus]
We're going at it tonight, tonight
There's a party on the rooftop top of the world
Tonight, tonight, and we're dancing on the edge of the Hollywood sign
I don't know if I'll make it, but watch how good I'll fake it
It's alright, alright, tonight, tonight
[Verse 2]
Woke up with a strange tattoo
Not sure how I got it
Not a dollar in my pocket
And it kinda looks just like you
Mixed with Zach Galifianakis, huh
