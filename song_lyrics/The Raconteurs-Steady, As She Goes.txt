[Verse 1]
Find yourself a girl and settle down
Live a simple life in a quiet town
[Refrain]
Steady as she goes (Steady as she goes)
Steady as she goes (Steady as she goes)
So steady as she goes
[Verse 2]
Your friends have shown a kink in the single life
You've had too much to think, now you need a wife
[Refrain]
Steady as she goes (Steady as she goes)
So steady as she goes (Steady as she goes)
[Chorus]
Well here we go again
You've found yourself a friend that knows you well
But no matter what you do
You'll always feel as though you tripped and fell
[Refrain]
So steady as she goes
