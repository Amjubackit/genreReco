[Verse 1]
Play in the backyard
Where the grass and spiderwebs grow up next to us
Say, what's your interests?
Tell me how you plan to give up on all of them
Hey, why'd we leave?
Could've stayed for a while if we knew where we're ending up
Hide in the basement
Concealed well enough so we won't get evicted
[Verse 2]
Pay all your savings
To a debt you that you didn't know you had been living in
Hide the black eye
That you give yourself every time you get wasted
Hey, why'd we leave?
Could've stayed for a while if we knew this is all we got
Lie, it's all weeds
Could've swore that the flowers would've bloomed, but they've hidden
[Chorus]
Rain
You're better off in the clouds as we fade
Barely leaving a semblance of
What we thought it meant to grow up
When things don't get better
No, things don't get better and
Rain
You're better off in the clouds as we fade
Barely leaving a semblance of
What we thought it meant to grow up
When things don't get better
No, things don't get better, just different[Bridge]
Stay, the bed's warm enough
If you step into the living room, you'll find a job to do
Buy some more time
Try to call in sick 'cause you haven't been sleeping
Lie if you want
Melody, never change
Day in, day out
Day in, day out
All the same
Write like a kid
Can't create anything
That's worth the ink
That's worth the page I'm wasting
Makes me feel like I haven't made anything
That makes me feel
Makes me feel
[Chorus]
Rain
You're better off in the clouds as we fade
Barely leaving a semblance of
What we thought it meant to grow up
When things don't get better
No, things don't get better and
Rain
You're better off in the clouds as we fade
Barely leaving a semblance of
What we thought it meant to grow up
When things don't get better
No, things don't get better, just different[Outro]
Play in the backyard
Where the grass and spiderwebs grow up next to us
Say, what's your interests?
Tell me how you plan to give up on all of them
