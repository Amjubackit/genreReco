[Spoken Intro]
Look at somebody and tell 'em that
Jesus brought the sunshine
Come on, if you know that he brought the sunshine
Come on move a little bit
I just want some young people out there
To just come up here
We don't want y'all to go crazy
But come on give us some love
Yeah that's what I'm talking about
Come on, where our young people at?
[Pre-Chorus]
You made my day
You came my way (we love y'all)
You heard me every time I pray
You gave me peace
You gave me grace
You put a smile upon my face
[Chorus]
You brought the sunshine (you brought the sunshine)
In my life (threw out the lifeline)
Threw out the lifeline (you brought the sunshine)
Saved my life (threw out the lifeline)
Since then I have known Christ
There has been such a change in my life
[Verse]
Oh (Jesus is the answer)
Oh, Jesus is the answer (he breaks every fetter)
He breaks every fetter (it really doesn't matter)
There's nothing impossible, nothing infallible
Nothing to hard [???] got the word out
(No matter what your problem) no matter what your problem
(God can always solve 'em) God can always solve 'em
(Cast your cares upon him)
Try him today he will brighten up your day
[Scatting] I know he will, I know, I know, I know he will
[Chorus]
You brought the sunshine (in my life)
Threw out the lifeline (threw out the lifeline)
You brought the sunshine (saved my life)
Threw out the lifeline
Since then I have known Christ
There has been such a change in my life
[Bridge]
I'm a witness (can I get a witness?)
That Jesus (anybody know Jesus? won't he make a way in your life)
Will make a difference in your life
I'm a witness (can I get a witness?)
That Jesus (anybody know Jesus? won't he open doors for you)
Will make a difference in your life
I'm a witness (can I get a witness?)
That Jesus (anybody know Jesus? won't he make a way for you)
Will make a difference in your life
Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
Oh
[Outro]
You made, you made my day (oh)
You came, you came my way (oh)
You made, you made my way (we see y'all back there)
You came, you came my way (oh)
You made, you made my day (oh)
You came, you came my way
