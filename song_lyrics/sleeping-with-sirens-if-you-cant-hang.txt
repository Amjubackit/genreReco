[Verse 1: Kellin Quinn]
Met a girl at seventeen
Thought she meant the world to me
So I gave her everything
She turned out to be a cheat
Said she'd been thinking for a long time
And she found somebody new
I've been thinking that this whole time
Girl, I never thought you'd stay, that's okay
I hope he takes your filthy heart and then he throws you away someday
Before you go, there's one thing you oughta know
[Pre-Chorus: Kellin Quinn]
If you can't hang then, there's the door, baby
If you can't hang then, there's the door, baby
If you can't hang then, there's the door, baby
If you can't hang then, there's the door
[Chorus: Kellin Quinn]
I-I-I don't wanna take your precious time
'Cause you're such a pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty face
But you turned into a pretty big waste of my time
I-I-I don't wanna take up all your time
'Cause you're such a pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty face
But you turned into a pretty big waste of my time
