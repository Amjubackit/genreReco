[Verse 1:  Brian Johnson]
We've seen what You can do, oh, God of wonders
Your power has no end
The things You've done before, in greater measure
You will do again
[Pre-Chorus:  Brian Johnson]
'Cause there's no prison wall You can't break through
No mountain You can't move, all things are possible
There's no broken body You can't raise
No soul that You can't save, all things are possible
[Chorus: Brian Johnson]
The darkest night
You can light it up
You can light it up
God of revival
Let hope arise
Death is overcome
You've already won
God of revival
[Verse 2: Brian Johnson]
You rose in victory and now You're seated
Forever on the throne
So why should my heart fear what You've defeated?
I will trust in You alone[Pre-Chorus:  Brian Johnson]
'Cause there's no prison wall You can't break through
No mountain You can't move, all things are possible
There's no broken body You can't raise
No soul that You can't save, all things are possible
[Chorus: Brian Johnson]
The darkest night
You can light it up
You can light it up
Oh, God of revival
Let hope arise
Death is overcome
You've already won
Oh, God of revival
God of revival
[Interlude: Brian Johnson]
We're gonna turn this into a prayer tonight
Over our nation, over our cities
[Bridge: Brian Johnson & Jenn Johnson]
Come awaken Your people, come awaken Your city
Oh, God of revival, pour it out, pour it out
Every stronghold will crumble, hear the chains hit the ground
Oh, God of revival, pour it out, pour it out
Come awaken Your people, come awaken Your city
Oh, God of revival, pour it out, pour it out
Every stronghold will crumble, I hear the chains hit the ground
Oh, God of revival, pour it out, pour it out[Chorus: Brian Johnson]
Oh, the darkest night
You can light it up
You can light it up
Oh, God of revival
Let hope arise
Death is overcome
You've already won
God of revival
Oh, God of revival
[Interlude: Brian Johnson]
Come awaken our hearts to Your glory
We sing, come awaken Your people, come awaken this city
[Bridge: Brian Johnson & Jenn Johnson]
Come awaken Your people, come awaken Your city
Oh, God of revival, pour it out, pour it out
Every stronghold will crumble, I hear the chains hit the ground
Oh, God of revival, pour it out, pour it out
Come awaken Your people, come awaken Your city
Oh, God of revival, pour it out, pour it out (
Now you sing it, every stronghold
)
Every stronghold will crumble, hear the chains hit the ground
Oh, God of revival, pour it out, pour it out
[Interlude: Jenn Johnson & 
Brian Johnson
]
We pour out Your spirit, glory (
Yeah, sing it out, your own song
)
Hey, hey, hey
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, God of revival (
Start to raise your voice
)
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, God of revival (Fan the flame afresh in me, God)
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, God of revival (Revive me tonight, God, yeah)
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, God of revival (Fan the flame)
Oh, and oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, God of revival[Bridge: Brian Johnson & Jenn Johnson]
Come awaken Your people, come awaken Your city
Oh, God of revival, pour it out, pour it out
Every stronghold will crumble, I hear the chains hit the ground
Oh, God of revival, pour it out, pour it out
[Outro: Brian Johnson]
There's no prison wall You can't break through
No mountain You can't move, all things are possible
There's no broken body You can't raise
No soul that You can't save, all things are possible
All things are possible
