[Verse 1]
Moving on
So I just see this on my own
Just let me go
You never saw this in my eyes before
You're moving on
You decided to go on your own
Just let me know
That you can feel the way you did before
[Instrumental Chorus]
[Verse 2]
Moving on
So I just see this on my own
Just let me go
I got out of it to reach for more
You're moving on
You decided to go on your own
Just let me know
Another reason that you came here for
[Instrumental Chorus]
[Outro]
Moving on
Moving on
Moving on
Moving on
