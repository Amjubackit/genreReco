[Intro]
Banger
[Chorus: Future]
Too many bracelets'll sprain a nigga wrist
Comin' from the gutter, never imagined livin' like this
Five-thousand shots when I'm at the Pow-Wow with the clique, yeah
She gotta be bossed up in order to be my bitch, yeah (
DJ on the beat so it's a banger
)
[Verse 1: Future]
It ain't a coincidence, these shooters ready to go on stains
He done took two transformers, fentanyl got him out his brain
Throw him in the water, get them sharks on him like a big ol' snake (Slatt)
Came off the cornеr with some gangsters, took this shit to space
Shootеr had his mask off, he didn't even think about it (Didn't think about it)
Gotta keep it one-thousand, tryna clear the bank out
Been in them trenches, holdin' switches like a auntie (Like my auntie)
Spent half a ticket on it and it was antique (Skrrt)
I put lil' demon on that hit, he gon' go brazy
Won't even cost a vehicle to get you this mutilated
They caught him in the cut and switched him up, and hit his lady
We gon' kill the shooter when he come back if he hit the baby
Couldn't make the store, he want that coke, now shit gettin' slimed out (Slimed out)
One mill' a show, it's on the floor, these niggas dyin' now (Niggas dyin' now)
I'm takin' G6 to feel like I'm on Saturn (I'm on Saturn)
I could've leased it, but I cashed out like a scammer (Pluto)
From the bottom to the top, made it do what it's supposed to do (Pluto)
I came up dirty, now my check right, my money blue (Super)
I used to sell it to these junkies, now some time I use (Turn up)
Cost a lot of mon-yun, get you done-yun, knocked out your shoes (Woo)
I was just a lil' nigga servin' GRAMMYs, yeah (Yeah)
I'ma catch the flu from solitary (Yeah, yeah, I swear)
It ain't no sleepin' when you legendary (Pluto)
My main bitch come secondary (Freebandz)[Chorus: Future]
Too many bracelets'll sprain a nigga wrist
Comin' from the gutter, never imagined livin' like this
Five-thousand shots when I'm at the Pow-Wow with the clique, yeah
She gotta be bossed up in order to be my bitch, yeah
[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
Them hoes gotta get my mama involved for me to reason
I put my brother before the nation, they say I'm treason
 (Wow, wow, wow)
I fuck with her energy, spiritually, she be keepin' her beads on (Keep her beads on)
I done gave him a gun while he on the run, brodie a street one (Wow, wow, wow)
They stay out the streets, ain't none right here 'fore you play D1 (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Why you go on the 'Gram bashin' my name knowin' that the streets warm?
Told a young nigga when he catch another body, told him to keep goin'
Got shot in his neck, they pronounced him dead, brodie breathed strong (Wow, wow, wow)
You can be my backbone in rare form, I still reject you (Wow, wow, wow)
Get back, you a real neighborhood hero, they'll still neglect you
I gave the streets more than my own kids, that disrespectful
You can't dig this deep in the trenches, you gon' need a shovel
I don't want no more Adderall capsules, medical
Data connected with Apple, federal
He gave me some pills and a napkin
Everything happened is tragic
You that mad? Get him in traffic
Get a address to say you arrivin'
Took a plea deal
, gave him eleven
He kept it P, so it's Only The Family[Chorus: Future & 
Lil Durk
