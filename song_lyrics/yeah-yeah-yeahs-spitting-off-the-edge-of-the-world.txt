[Verse: Karen O]
Cowards, here's the sun
So bow your heads
In the absence of bombs
Draw your breath
[Pre-Chorus: Karen O, 
Perfume Genius
]
Dark, dark places shall be none
She's melting houses of gold
And the kids cry out
[Chorus: Karen O]
We're spitting off the edge of the world
Out in the night
Never had no chance
Nowhere to hide
Spitting off the edge of the world
Out comes the sun
Never had no chance
Nowhere to run
[Bridge: Karen O, 
Perfume Genius
]
Mama, what have you done?
I trace your steps
In the darkness of one
Am I what's left?
Silver lines whisper to me
Wounded arms must carry the load
And the kids cry out[Chorus: Karen O, 
Karen O & Perfume Genius
]
We're spitting off the edge of the world
Out in the night
Never had no chance
Nowhere to hide
We're spitting off the edge of the world
Nowhere to run
Never had no chance
Out comes the sun
Spitting off the edge of the world
Winds from the sky
Never had no chance
Will watch us rise
