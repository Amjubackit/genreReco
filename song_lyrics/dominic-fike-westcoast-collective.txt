[Intro]
I used to live out west in a collective
I used to, yeah
[Verse 1]
We used to live out west in a collective
Everybody got arrested 'cause nobody wanted sleep
I used to dish out verses on purpose
And if you wanted to purchase one you weren't as good as me
I don't know if that time is comin' to an end
I hope the band gets back together when it's over
[Chorus]
Don't you go runnin' for the hills
You can't outrun it by yourself
By yourself
[Verse 2]
And when I call you up, you barely answer
You think you got it all figured out
You act like you don't even remember
Oh, you're all by yourself
[Chorus]
Don't you go runnin' for the hills
You can't outrun it by yourself
By yourself
