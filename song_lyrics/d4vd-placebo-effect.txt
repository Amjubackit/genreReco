[Verse 1]
Days go by so rapidly
Oh, won't you comfort me
I know what we had
It was make believe, oh
A placebo
I can’t take a loss like that again
I'd rather float off in the wind
But maybe this is how it's supposed to be
I guess we’ll see on the other side
Where the grass seems to be greener
On the other side
Where my ribcage could be cleaner
On the other side
Where the light will not go out
Oh, on the other side
Thе other side
[Verse 2]
Take my timе
Please stop rushing me for company
I can't figure it out
I need you here, but you're not near
I can't, I can't
I can't, I can't
Remember what was a dream or a memory
Love isn't real
Not to me, not to me
[Outro]
Oh, oh, oh oh
It was make believe, oh
A placebo
