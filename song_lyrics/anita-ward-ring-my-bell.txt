[Verse 1]
I'm glad you're home
Now did you really miss me
I guess you did by the look in your eyes
(Look in your eyes, look in your eyes)
Well, lay back and relax while I put away the dishes
(Put away the dishes)
Then you and me can rock-a-bye
[Chorus]
You can ring my bell, ring my bell
You can ring my bell, ring my bell
You can ring my bell, ring my bell
You can ring my bell, ring my bell
[Verse 2]
The night is young and full of possibilities
Well, come on and let yourself be free
My love for you, so long I've been saving
Tonight was made for me and you
[Chorus]
You can ring my bell, ring my bell
You can ring my bell, ring my bell
You can ring my bell, ring my bell
You can ring my bell, ring my bell[Bridge]
You can ring my bell, you can ring my bell
Ding-dong-ding, ah, ring it
You can ring my bell, anytime, anywhere
Ring it, ring it, ring it, ring it, ah
You can ring my bell, you can ring my bell
Ding-dong-ding, ah, ring it
You can ring my bell, anytime, anywhere
Ring it, ring it, ring it, ring it, ah
[Refrain]
Bell, ring my bell
Ring my bell, ding-dong-ding, ah
Bell, ring my bell
Ring my bell, ring-a-ling-a-ling
Bell, ring my bell
Ring my bell, ding-dong-ding, ah
Bell, ring my bell
Ring my bell, ring-a-ling-a-ling
[Outro]
