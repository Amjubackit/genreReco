[Verse 1: HARDY]
Paint your truck tread with some red dust
While you kick up the long way home
Share some bootleg with your best buds
Wear a bit of that bonfire smoke
If a back porch swing and twang in your words
And settin' that hook was a Good Book verse, I'd be doin' alright
I'd know where I's goin' when I get to the other side 'cause
[Chorus: Morgan Wallen & HARDY]
Backroads and cold beer are my down-home prayer
Can't get no closer to the Man upstairs
Than way out there, where the river runs
Lord knows I'd be one hell of a disciple
If bein' country was in the Bible
Hallelujah, amen
Heaven blessed this life I live
Hallelujah, amen, amen
[Verse 2: Morgan Wallen]
If "John Deere Green" was 3:16
And old barstools were back pew seats
These Friday nights would all just seem like Sunday mornin'
If them words in red were a little more read this sinner'd be a saint instead
[Chorus: Morgan Wallen & HARDY]
'Cause backroads and cold beer are my down-home prayer
Can't get no closer to the Man upstairs
Than way out there, where the river runs
Lord knows I'd be one hell of a disciple
If bein' country was in the Bible
Hallelujah, amen
Heaven blessed this life I live
Hallelujah, amen, amen[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus: Morgan Wallen, 
HARDY

'Cause backroads and cold beer
Are my down-home prayer
We can't get no closer to God's grace, I swear
Than way out there, where the river runs
Lord knows I'd be one hell of a disciple
If bein' country was in the Bible
Hallelujah, amen
Heaven blessed this life I live
Hallelujah, amen, amen
