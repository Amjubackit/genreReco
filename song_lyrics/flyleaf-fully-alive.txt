[Verse 1]
Telling Layla's story spoken
'Bout how all her bones are broken
Hammers fall on all the pieces
Two months in the cover creases
[Chorus]
Fully alive, more than most
Ready to smile and love life
Fully alive and she knows
How to believe in futures
[Verse 2]
All my complaints shrink to nothing
I'm ashamed of all my somethings
She's glad for one day of comfort
Only because she has suffered
[Chorus]
Fully alive, more than most
Ready to smile and love life
Fully alive and she knows
How to believe in futures
[Chorus]
Fully alive, more than most
Ready to smile and love life
Fully alive and she knows
How to believe in futures
Fully alive, more than most
Ready to smile and love life
Fully alive and she knows
How to believe in futures
