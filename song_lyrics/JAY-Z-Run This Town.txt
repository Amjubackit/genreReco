[Intro: Rihanna & 
Jay Z
]
Feel it comin' in the air (
Yeah
)
Hear the screams from everywhere (
Yeah
)
I'm addicted to the thrill (
I'm ready
)
It's a dangerous love affair (
What's up? Come on
)
Can't be scared when it goes down
Got a problem, tell me now (
What's up?
)
Only thing that's on my mind (
What's up?
)
Is who's gon' run this town tonight (
Ah, what's up?
)
Is who's gon' run this town tonight (
Yeah, what's up? Yeah
)
We gon' run this town
[Verse 1: Jay Z]
We are, yeah, I said it: we are
This is Roc Nation, pledge your allegiance
Get your fatigues on, all black everything
Black cards, black cars, all black everything
And our girls are blackbirds ridin' with they Dillingers
I get more in depth if you boys really real enough
This is la Familia,
 
I'll explain later
But for now, let me get back to this paper
I'm a couple bands down and I'm tryin' to get back
I gave Doug a grip and lost a flip for five stacks
Yeah, I'm talkin' 5 comma, 6 zeros, dot zero, here Doug
Back to runnin' circles round niggas, now we squared up
Hold up
