[Verse 1: Brittany Diaz]
It's getting dark now
I'm at the end of myself
I'm out of options
I've tried and nothing has helped
I don't feel innocent
The streets are wild at best
I need a safe place
To feel like a child again
[Pre-Chorus: Brittany Diaz]
The tears in my eyes, the tired in my bones
The death in my life, the heavy in my soul
Like the streetlights turnin' on
Telling me it's time to come home
[Chorus: Brittany Diaz]
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
The streetlights are turnin' on
I'm comin' home
[Verse 2: Brittany Diaz]
It's running to You
And seeing You run after to me
You're where my hеart belongs
I've nevеr felt such sweet relief
(Oh, oh, oh)
[Pre-Chorus: Brittany Diaz]
The tears in my eyes, the tired in my bones
The death in my life, the heavy in my soul
Like the streetlights turnin' on
Telling me it's time to come home
[Chorus: Brittany Diaz]
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
The streetlights are turnin' on
I'm comin' home
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
The streetlights are turnin' on
I'm comin' home
