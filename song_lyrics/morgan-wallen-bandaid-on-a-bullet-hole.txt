[Verse 1]
Girl, since you left me
Been tryin' to forget we
Ever became what we were
And I poured some whiskey
On places you kissed me
Tried to wash off all the hurt
But ain't nothin' workin'
I've lived out the words in
A thousand old sad country songs
But whenever I try to move on
[Chorus]
It's like tryna put a bandaid on a bullet hole
Tryna tell a cowboy to slow down
It's like watchin' the way that the river rolls
And then tellin' it to turn back around
And I've held some strangers, told people I hatе you
But I just keep hittin' a wall
It's like tryna put a bandaid on a bullet hole
It just don't do mе no good at all
[Verse 2]
If I was only
Heart broke and lonely
I'd head on back down to the bar
Find me a companion
But you left a canyon
Can't nobody fill in this heart[Chorus]
And girl, it's like tryna put a bandaid on a bullet hole
Tryna tell a cowboy to slow down
It's like watchin' the way that the river rolls
And then tellin' it to turn back around
And I've held some strangers told people I hate you
But I just keep hittin' a wall
It's like tryna put a bandaid on a bullet hole
It just don't do me no good at all
No damn good, damn good, damn good at all
[Bridge]
And baby tell me how you did it?
I just gotta know
And tell me what's your secret?
And how'd you let me go so easy?
[Chorus]
'Cause girl, it's like tryna put a bandaid on a bullet hole
Tryna tell a cowboy to slow down
It's like watchin' the way that the river rolls
And then tellin' it to turn back around
Oh, I've held some strangers told people I hate you
But I just keep hittin' a wall
It's like tryna put a bandaid on a bullet hole
It just don't do me no good at all
It's like tryna to put a bandaid on a bullet hole
It just don't do me no good at all
No damn good, damn good, damn good at all
