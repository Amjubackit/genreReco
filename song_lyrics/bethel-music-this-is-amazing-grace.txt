[Verse 1]
Who breaks the power of sin and darkness
Whose love is mighty and so much stronger
The King of Glory, the King above all kings
Who shakes the whole earth with holy thunder
Who leaves us breathless in awe and wonder
The King of Glory, the King above all kings
[Chorus]
This is amazing grace
This is unfailing love
That You would take my place
That You would bear my cross
You would lay down Your life
That I would be set free
Jesus, I sing for
All that You've done for me
All that You've done for me
[Verse 2]
Who brings our chaos back into order
Who makes the orphan, a son and daughter
The King of Glory, the King above all kings
Who rules the nations with truth and justice
Shines like the sun in all of its brilliance
The King of Glory, the King above all kings
[Chorus]
This is amazing grace
This is unfailing love
That You would take my place
That You would bear my cross
You would lay down Your life
That I would be set free, oh-ooh
Jesus, I sing for
All that You've done... for me
All, all that You've done for me
[Bridge]
Worthy is the Lamb who was slain
And worthy is the King who conquered the grave
And worthy is the Lamb who was slain
Yeah, worthy is the King who conquered the grave
And worthy is the Lamb who was slain
And worthy is the King who conquered the grave
Worthy is the Lamb who was slain
Worthy, worthy, worthy
[Chorus]
This is amazing grace
This is unfailing love
That You would take my place
Oh, that You would bear my cross
You would lay down Your life
That I would be set free, oh-ooh
Jesus, I sing for
All that You've done... for me
[Spontaneous]
Oh, this is what I will sing
This is what we will sing
All that You've done
All that You have done
I've tasted, I've tasted
I've tasted, I've tasted
[4:52?]
Of the riches
Of the most beautiful, [God?]
What other king leaves the throne
What other king leaves his home
What other king leaves his glory
What other king leaves his glory to die
Yeah, his glory to die, oh-ooh...
[Chorus]
This is amazing grace
This is unfailing love
That You would take my place
Oh, that You would bear my cross
You would lay down Your life
That I would be set free, yeah
Jesus, I sing for
All that You've done!
All that You've done for me, oh-ohh
This is amazing grace
This is unfailing love
That You would take my place
That You would bear my cross
You would lay down Your life
That I would be set free, oh-ooh
Jesus, I sing for
All that You've done... for me
All that You've done for me
