[Verse 1]
I guess to you now, I'm just a face in the crowd
Oh, God, kindly please, would you kill me now?
Late at night in my room, lie awake, think of you
And all your little dooms
[Chorus]
Last night I dreamt I still knew you
You
I carved out a place in this world for two
But it's empty without you
[Refrain]
I got all this love I've got to keep to myself
All this effort to make it look effortless
All this love I've got to keep to myself
All this effort to make it look effortless
[Verse 2]
Confront all the pain like a gift under the tree
Oh, please, I can't be who you need me to be
I grind in the sunshine, grind in the rain
So real that I feel fakе
[Chorus]
Last night I dreamt I still knew you
You
I carved out a placе in this world for two
But it's empty without you[Refrain]
I got all this love I've got to keep to myself
All this effort to make it look effortless
Got all this love I've got to keep to myself
All this effort to make it look effortless
[Bridge]
One day, every candle's gotta run out of wax
One day, no one will remember me when they look back
I can't stop, can't stop 'til we catch all your ears, though
Somewhere between Mike Tyson and Van Gogh, oh, oh
[Chorus]
You
You
I carved out a place in this world for two
But it's empty without you
[Outro]
I got all this love I've got to keep to myself
All this effort to make it look effortless
Got all this love I've got to keep to myself, myself, oh
All this effort to make it look effortless (All this effort to make it look effortless)
All this effort to make it look effortless (All this effort to make it look effortless), oh, oh, oh
All this effort to make it look effortless (All this effort to make it look effortless), yeah, hoo
