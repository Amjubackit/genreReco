[Verse 1]
Note to self
A truck only goes so far on half a tank
That credit card ain't money in the bank
If it don't sound like a good idea it probably ain't
[Verse 2]
Note to self
You can't change a way she's gonna change her mind
She might love you but she won't like you all the time
'Stead of taking her for granted take her somewhere nice
Note to self
[Chorus]
Love ain't diamond rings
Bigger don't always mean better
The grass ain't always green
Money don't grow on trees ever
Can't make somebody bе made for ya
God ain't gonna do the praying for ya
Whiskey's bеst left up there on a shelf
[Verse 3]
Note to self
Some girls say goodbye and mean goodbye
It don't mean that she don't hurt and she don't cry
You're gonna wish she woulda
When she tells you she don't wanna fight
Note to self[Chorus]
Love ain't diamond rings
Bigger don't always mean better
The grass ain't always green
Money don't grow on trees ever
Can't make somebody be made for ya
God ain't gonna do the praying for ya
Whiskey's best left up there on a shelf
Note to self
[Verse 4]
I shoulda kept it in my pocket
I shoulda known it from the start
I shoulda read it every morning
Shoulda wrote it on my heart
[Chorus]
Love ain't diamond rings
Bigger don't always mean better
The grass ain't always green
Money don't grow on trees ever
Can't make somebody be made for ya
God ain't gonna do the praying for ya
Whiskey's best left up there on a shelf
You're gonna have to find the answers somewhere else
Note to self[Outro]
Note to self
A truck only goes so far on half a tank
