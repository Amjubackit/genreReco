[Spoken part]
Oh, I beg your pardon ladies and gentlemen
I did not know that you were waiting for me
Hold them close
Petals of a rose
Thorns as well
Friends and foes
Have no fear
Seize the day, the day
Seize the day, the day
Seize the day, the day
Seize the day, the day
I don't mind what ever happened
I don't care what ever happened
Lalalalalalalala
[Spoken part]
What is going to happen now
Can't see much in the future
Let them burn
Things of cotton
Admire the fire
Things undone
There's applause
There'll be encores
You're sincere
That's what's we're
Have no fear
Seize the day, the day
Seize the day, the day
Seize the day, the day
Seize the day, the day
I don't mind what ever happened
I don't care what ever happened
Lalalalalalalala
I don't
I don't

What, what, what
Well
What, what, what
Well
Oh
Talking 'bout love
