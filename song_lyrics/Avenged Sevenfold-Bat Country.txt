[Intro]
He who makes a beast out of himself
Gets rid of the pain of being a man
[Verse 1]
Caught here in a fiery blaze, won't lose my will to stay
I tried, to drive all through the night
The heat stroke ridden weather, the barren empty sights
No oasis, here to see
The sand is singing deathless words to me
[Chorus]
Can't you help me as I'm startin' to burn?
 
(All alone)
Too many doses, and I'm starting to get an attraction
My confidence is leaving me on my own
 
(All alone)
No one can save me, and you know I don't want the attention
[Verse 2]
As I, adjust to my new sights
The rarely tired lights, will take me to new heights
My hand is on the trigger, I'm ready to ignite
Tomorrow might not make it, but everything's all right
Mental fiction, follow me
Show me what it's like to be set free
[Chorus]
Can't you help me as I'm startin' to burn? (All alone)
Too many doses, and I'm starting to get an attraction
My confidence is leaving me on my own (All alone)
No one can save me, and you know I don't want the attention
