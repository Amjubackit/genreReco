[Verse 1: Abbie Gamboa]
Who is like You?
No one that I know of
I could search all the Earth and find not one
And there's no shadow
That You won't be found in
Your face illuminates the deep in me
[Chorus: Abbie Gamboa]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
No one like You
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Faithful and true
No one like You
[Verse 2: Abbie Gamboa]
And all creation
Flickering Your beauty
Every starlight responding to Your name
And all of Heaven
Is caught up in Your glory
Jesus Christ, our humble, wounded King
[Chorus: Abbie Gamboa]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
No one like You
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Faithful and true
No one like You (Sing that again, no one)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
No one like You
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Faithful and true
No one like You
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge: SarahBeth Smith]
I could search all of Heaven abovе and never find another likе You, another like You
I could search all the Earth below and never find another like You, another like You
There's no other more beautiful
I'll never find another like You, another like You
There's no other more wonderful
I'll never find another like You, another like You
I could search all of Heaven above and never find another like You, another like You
I could search all the Earth below and never find another like You, another like You
There's no other more beautiful
I'll never find another like You, another like You
There's no other more wonderful
I'll never find another like You
[Post-Bridge: Abbie Gamboa & SarahBeth Smith]
Who is like the Lord?
Who is like the Lord?
Who is like the Lord?
Who is like the Lord?
[Chorus: Abbie Gamboa & SarahBeth Smith]
Oh-oh-oh-oh
No one like You
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Faithful and true
No one like You (Sing it again, no one)
Oh-oh-oh-oh
No one like You
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Faithful and true
No one like You
[Outro: SarahBeth Smith]
I could search all of Heaven above and never find another like You, another like You
I could search all the Earth below and never find another like You, another like You
There's no other more beautiful
I'll never find another like You, another like You
There's no other more wonderful
I'll never find another like You, another...
