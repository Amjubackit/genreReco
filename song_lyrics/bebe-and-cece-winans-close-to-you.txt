[Intro: BeBe Winans]
I just wanna be close to you
[Verse 1: BeBe Winans & CeCe WInans]
Sunshine, moonlight, delight
Just a couple words describing who you are
Lovely, so lovely
Want everyone to know why I'm in love with you
Patient and strong, always
No matter what I face you've been there to see me through
Just right (Right on) on time
It took a while to see that your love was true
[Chorus: BeBe & CeCe Winans, BeBe, CeCe]
Now no one can Undo
'Cause I belong to you
Until the end of time
It's good to know, good to know you're mine
And all i want to say
'Til my dying day
I just wanna be close to you
[Verse 2: BeBe Winans & CeCe Winans]
Honest and sweet
Heaven is where I wanna be
Where I am when I'm with you
Perfect (Perfect), yes perfect
Is what He gave for all the world to see
[Chorus: BeBe & CeCe Winans, BeBe, CeCe]
Now no one can undo
'Cause I belong to you
Until the end of time
Good to know you're mine
And all I want (all I wanna say)
'Til my dyâ€” ('til my dying day)
I just wanna be close to you
[Bridge: BeBe & CeCe Winans, BeBe, CeCe]
Come on, CeCe, follow me
Dah dah, you say
Dah dah
Dah dah
Dah dah dah dah dah, dah dah dah dah dah dah dah
Dah dah, mmm, mmm, dah dah
It took a while to see but now we know the truth
And no one can
[Chorus: BeBe & CeCe Winans, BeBe, CeCe]
Now no one can (Undo)
I belong (To you)
Until the end (Of time)
Good to know (Good to know you're mine)
Judging my will (Will)
How long will you stay?
I just wanna be close to you
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
How long will you stay? (Hey)
I just wanna be close to you
