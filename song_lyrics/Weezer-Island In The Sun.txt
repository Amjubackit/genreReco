[Intro]
Hip hip
Hip hip
Hip hip
Hip hip
[Verse 1]
When you're on a holiday
You can't find the words to say
All the things that come to you
And I wanna feel it too
[Chorus]
On an island in the sun
We'll be playin' and havin' fun
And it makes me feel so fine
I can't control my brain
[Refrain]
Hip hip
Hip hip
[Verse 2]
When you're on a golden sea
You don't need no memory
Just a place to call your own
As we drift into the zone
