[Verse 1]
Oh my drunken southern star
How you tried to hide in darkness
Slipped from orbit
Now you’re dangerously close
[Verse 2]
Come out, come out
From all your hiding out
We’ll dig in our heels
Salute the battlefields
Where our broken hearts were born, oh
[Chorus]
And the storm clouds are thirsty
I can see them bursting, watch them gathering light
And the walls in the bedroom now are pounding out
Were we broken open baby, maybe just a crack
Swore I heard you whisper that you preferred us like that, oh
[Verse 3]
My broken open child
Were we thirsty, thorned with wild eyes
Still, we are slaves to the sirens of the salty sea
Oh, oh, oh, oh
