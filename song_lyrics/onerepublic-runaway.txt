[Intro]
Run away
Right now, let's just run away
All that talk is killing me
One last shot, hold onto me, oh
[Verse 1]
There's something I gotta say to ya
There's somewhere we gotta go
And now they're sinkin' in the sand, chasin' what we can
Baby, it's not enough (Oh)
It's like we're stuck in the mezzanine
With twenty floors left to go (Oh yeah)
And now they're drivin' in the rain, tryin' to switch the lane
But you already know
[Pre-Chorus]
So don't waste this time, yeah, I don't move slow
But one good shot and I'll let you know
It's all I want, yeah
[Chorus]
Can we just let go and run away?
Right now, lеt's just run away
All that talk is killing me
One last shot, hold onto me, oh
Babе, I think we should run away
I'm my own worst enemy
Blue sky's only miles away
One last shot, hold onto me, oh[Verse 2]
There's something I gotta say to ya
I'm on that new energy (Oh yeah)
Not on that "easy as it goes, wait for miracles"
No "what will be will be"
[Pre-Chorus]
No, so don't waste this time, yeah, I don't move slow
But one good shot and I'll let you know
It's all I want, yeah
[Chorus]
Can we just let go and run away?
Right now, let's just run away
All that talk is killing me
One last shot, hold onto me, oh
Babe, I think we should run away
I'm my own worst enemy
Blue sky's only miles away
One last shot, hold onto me, oh (Oh yeah)
[Bridge]
One last shot, hold onto me, oh
[Outro]
Run away
Right now, let's just run away
All that talk is killing me
One last shot, hold onto me, oh
