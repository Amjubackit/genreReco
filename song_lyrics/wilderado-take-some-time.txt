[Verse 1]
Take some time to get it off your chest
Yeah, take it and give it a rest
You and I, we're just doing our best
But we make it into a mess
[Chorus]
Ah-ah
We looking for the other side
Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
We looking for the other side
[Verse 2]
Need to know, getting off on time
I need to know when I'm on your mind
And you were the one, you were the yield
I was the man looking over the field
Give me an hour at the edge of my faith
All the way beyond my case
Well I love what you've done, love what you do
You were the man but
[Chorus]
Ah-ah
We looking for the other side
Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
We looking for the other side
Go and look around
[Bridge]
Give me a chance, doing myself
Give me a chance, down from the shelf
Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
And you were the one, you were the yield
I was the man below the field
Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Say what you want, say what you need
Over the heart, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
We looking for the other side (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
[Chorus]
Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
We looking for the other side
Ah-ah
We looking for the other side (And you were the one, you were the yield, I was the man looking over the fields)
Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
We looking for the other side (Say what you want, say what you need, over the heart, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
