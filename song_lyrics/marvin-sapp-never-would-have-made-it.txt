Never would have made it
Never could have made it without You
I would have lost it all
But now I see how You were there for me
And I can say
Never would have made it
Never could have made it
Without You
I would have lost it all
But I now I see
How You were there for me
And I can say
I'm stronger, I'm wiser
I'm better, much better
When I look back
Over all You brought me through
I can see that You were the One
I held on to
And I never, never would have made it
(Never would have made it)
Oh, I never could have made it
(Never could have made it without You)
