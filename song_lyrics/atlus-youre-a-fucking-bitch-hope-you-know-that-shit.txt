[Verse 1]
Girl, where you been at? Don't try to lie
I smell his cologne on your shirt, it's hard to breathe in
You're quite the actress, you make me sick
Yeah, I just wanna get the truth, you plead the fifth
[Pre-Chorus]
You turn out the lights
Kick off your shoes, lay in our bed
And you whisper sweet nothings in my ear
But I can't trust a word you said
[Chorus]
You're a fuckin' bitch, hope you know that shit
You can never trust a ho, had to learn that quick
How many others are you sleepin' with?
All I know is I don't deserve this
You're a fuckin' bitch, hope you know that shit
You can never trust a ho, had to learn that quick
How many others are you sleepin' with?
All I know is I don't deserve this
[Verse 2]
Go ahead, yeah, just play the victim
Go tell your friends if I was there, you wouldn't need them
And justify that night you had in his bed
I'm sorry I was busy workin', tryna pay our debts
[Pre-Chorus]
You turn out the lights
Kick off your shoes, lay in our bed
And you whisper sweet nothings in my ear
But I can't get 'em out of my head
[Chorus]
You're a fuckin' bitch, hope you know that shit
You can never trust a ho, had to learn that quick
How many others are you sleepin' with?
All I know is I don't deserve this
You're a fuckin' bitch, hope you know that shit
You can never trust a ho, had to learn that quick
How many others are you sleepin' with?
All I know is I don't deserve this
[Interlude]
First saved message
I know I fucked up
It's one mistake, please
Don't leave me, I'll do better
I promise I'll do better, please
[Chorus]
You're a fuckin' bitch, hope you know that shit
You can never trust a ho, had to learn that quick
How many others are you sleepin' with?
All I know is I don't deserve this
You're a fuckin' bitch, hope you know that shit
You can never trust a ho, had to learn that quick
How many others are you sleepin' with?
All I know is I don't deserve this
