[Verse 1]
Light of the world
You step down into darkness
Opened my eyes let me see,
Beauty that made this heart adore you
Hope of a life spent with you,
[Chorus]
And here I am to worship,
Here I am to bow down,
Here I am to say that you're my God,
You're altogether lovely,
Altogether worthy,
Altogether wonderful to me
[Verse 2]
King of all days, oh so highly exalted
Glorious in heaven above,
Humbly you came to the earth you created
All for love's sake became poor,
[Chorus]
[Bridge]
I'll never know how much it cost
to see my sin upon that cross
I'll never know how much it cost
to see my sin upon that cross
And I'll never know how much it cost
to see my sin upon that cross
No I'll never know how much it cost
to see my sin upon that cross
[Chorus]
Here I am to worship,
Here I am to bow down,
Here I am to say that you're my God,
You're altogether lovely,
Altogether worthy,
Altogether wonderful to me.
