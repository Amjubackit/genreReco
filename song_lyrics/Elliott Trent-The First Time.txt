[Verse 1]
Ooh, girl, your body
Got me on some other shit, you got it
You make these other hoes irrelevant, you poppin'
Don't ever let a hater tell you different
Cause you know every nigga trying to hit it
Betting none them other niggas with the business
You know I ain't trying to save no dreams
I'm just trying to make this money
I ain't trying share you with the team
Girl, I ain't trying to take nothing from ya
I just need a chick I can grind with and shine with and spend every dime with and ball 'til it's over
Swear that ass you got behind you got me standing at attention like a soldier
Like, tell me what I gotta do to make you mine for a lifetime?
We could make money all day, making love 'til the nighttime, yeah
If we ever fell in love, girl, I'd do it right the first time
In one try
[Chorus]
Ooh, girl, your body
Make a nigga wanna dive in
Girl, I wanna make you my chick
I just hope you realize it
Shawty, I'mma keep it real and be true
And won't nobody matter but you, babe
Just watch what I do
I'mma love you right the first time, first time, first time, baby
(Kissin' you, touchin' you, lovin' you, holdin' you, baby)
I'mma do it right the first time, first time, first time, baby
(Kissin' you, touchin' you, lovin' you, holdin' you, baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
