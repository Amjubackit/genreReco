[Verse 1]
If you're listening, whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Sing it back, whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
String from your tether unwinds (String from your tether unwinds)
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Up and outward to bind (Up and outward to bind)
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
[Chorus]
I was spinning free, whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
With a little sweet and simple numbing me
[Verse 2]
Are you listening? Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Sing it back, whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
So tell me, what do I need? (Tell me, what do I need?)
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
When words lose their meaning (When words lose their meaning)
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
[Chorus]
I was spinning free, whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
With a little sweet and simple numbing me, yeah
Stumble 'til you crawl, whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Sinking into sweet uncertainty
