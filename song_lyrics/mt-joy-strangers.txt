[Verse 1]
Well, I guess I'll have to fall in love with strangers
Ride through New York City like I'm famous
And if our lives don't work then we can change
Lord knows we've changed, love will rearrange us
Like, if you want freedom, that breathes on
Better not run when I'm hanging on
If you want freedom, you better free someone
Better not run when I'm blind
[Chorus]
'Cause I am over you
I am over you
And I am over you
I am over you
I am over you
And I am over you
Flesh wound, little flesh wound
[Verse 2]
I guess I'll have to fall in love with strangers
Go ride through New York City like I'm famous
And I did not want our love to be erased
But Lord knows we chased it, love just rearranged us
I'm everything I thought I was, even if I don't have much
My blue side, my fire eyes, my heart keeps me in the fight
Like if you want freedom, you better free someone
Better not run when I'm blind[Chorus]
But I am over you
I am over you
And I am over you
I am over you
I am over you
And I am over you
Flesh wound, little flesh wound
[Post-Chorus]
So long (I am over you, I am over you)
Other side now
I will be alright (I am over you, I am over you)
So long (I am over you, I am over you)
Other side now
I will be alright (I am over you, I am over you)
[Outro]
I guess I'll have to fall in love with strangers
Ride through New York City like I'm famous
And I did not want our love to be erased
But, Lord knows we chased it, love just rearranged us
