[Verse 1]
You see it all around you
Good loving gone bad
And usually it's too late when you
Realize what you had
[Pre-Chorus]
And my mind goes back
To a girl I met some years ago
Who told me
[Chorus]
Just hold on loosely, but don't let go
If you cling too tightly
You're gonna lose control
Your baby needs someone to believe in
And a whole lot of space to breathe in
[Verse 2]
So damn easy
When your feelings are such
To overprotect her
To love her too much
[Pre-Chorus]
And my mind goes back
To a girl I met some years ago
Who told me
[Chorus]
Just hold on loosely, but don't let go
If you cling too tightly
You're gonna lose control
Your baby needs someone to believe in
And a whole lot of space to breathe in
[Bridge]
Don't let her slip away
Sentimental fool
Don't let your heart get in the way
Yeah, yeah, yeah
[Verse 1]
You see it all around you
Good loving gone bad
And usually it's too late when you
Realize what you had
[Chorus]
So hold on loosely, but don't let go
If you cling too tightly
You're gonna lose control
Your baby needs someone to believe in
And a whole lot of space to breathe in
[Outro]
So hold on loosely, but don't let go
If you cling too tightly
You're gonna lose it
You're gonna lose control
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
So hold on loosely, but don't let go
If you cling too tightly
You're gonna lose control
Hold on loosely, but don't let go
If you cling too tightly to her
You're gonna lose control
Yeah, yeah, yeah
