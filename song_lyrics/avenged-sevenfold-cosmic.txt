[Verse 1]
Fade - from all that was before we shut another door
But not a last goodbye
Fate - has taken once again, a fight we'll never win
And time again we try
Left alone I can't wait too long, fade
Love - we loved so many times
And in so many lives sometimes we got it right
Pain - It found its way back in
Until we meet again into that good night
None too far as we chase through the stars beyond forever
I'll follow you

[Verse 2]
Dancing in the wind as roses born again
There you'll find me
Before the dawn of man in castles made of sand
There you'll find me
Writing in the caves as fire lights the way
There you'll find me
Mask of royal glow don in pharaoh's clothes
There you'll find me
Let it go
Rings of dust and ice weightless in the night
There you'll find me
Let it go[Outro]
Dancing in the wind as roses born again
There you'll find me
Before the dawn of man in castles made of sand
There you'll find me
Writing in the caves as fire lights the way
There you'll find me
Mask of royal glow don in pharaoh's clothes
There you'll find me
From all that was before we shut another door
But not a last goodbye
Taken once again, a fight we'll never win
And time again we try
(I'm gone, I'm gone)
We loved so many times
And in so many lives sometimes we got it right
(I'm gone, I'm gone)
It found its way back in, until we meet again
Into that good
