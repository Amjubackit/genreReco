[Intro]
It's a blue world without you
It's a blue world alone
[Chorus]
Yeah, well, this a mad world, it made me crazy
Might just turn around, do one-eighty
I ain't politickin', I ain't kissin' no babies
The devil on my doorstep bein' so shady
Mmm, don't trip, we don't gotta let him in
Don't trip
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I let it go
But I never go with it, mhm, yeah
[Verse 1]
Okay, cool as fall weather, fuck your bullshit
I'm here to make it all better with a little music for you
I don't do enough for you
Without you, it's the color blue, ooh, don't trip
I was in the city, they was talkin' that shit
Had the homies with me, all a sudden, they split
We ain't even worried, we just laughin', that's rich
You know how it goes, 
it ain't broke, don't fix
[Refrain]
Hey, one of these days
We'll all get by
Don't be afraid
Don't fall
