[Verse 1: Josh Homme]
Innocence has no resistance
Against a wicked counselor such as I
[Hook: Dave Grohl with Josh Homme]
(You won't make it out
You won't make it out)
[Verse 2: Josh Homme]
Shall I lead you to my parlor?
Poison offers disguised in just your size
[Hook: Dave Grohl with Josh Homme]
(You won't make it out
You won't make it out)
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3: Josh Homme]
You may think me altruistic
Feel my dark hypnosis closing in
[Hook: Dave Grohl with Josh Homme]
(You won't make it out
You won't make it out)[Chorus: Josh Homme]
Then you grow cold, cold, as I stare
As if no, none could compare
But you don't know how close, to ensnare
When I control, you will despair
[Hook: Dave Grohl with Josh Homme]
(You won't make it out
You won't make it out)
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 4: Josh Homme]
Sycophancy, solipsistic
Spider plays the fool to lure the fly
[Hook: Dave Grohl with Josh Homme]
(You won't make it out
You won't make it out)
[Chorus: Josh Homme]
Then you grow cold, cold, as I stare
As if no, none could compare
But you don't know how close, to ensnare
When I control, you will despair
