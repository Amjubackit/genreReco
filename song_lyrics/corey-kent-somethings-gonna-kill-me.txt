[Verse 1]
I've watched a California sunset
Burn from orange to gold
Bought a pawnshop six-string
Sold my soul to rock and roll
They say if you ain't busy livin'
Then you're just dyin' slow
I wanna say I've done it all by the time it's time to go
[Pre-Chorus]
Where and when and what'll be the death of me
Well, heaven only knows
[Chorus]
It might be the highway and it might be these songs
It might be the whiskey or the smoke inside these lungs
Ain't no way around it
One day I'm gonna die
If something's gonna kill me might as well be
What makes me feel alive
[Verse 2]
I've loved a damn good woman
I've had to let one go
Rode life's rollercoasters
Mountain highs and valley lows
Broke 100 on two wheels
Found revival on the road
The devil's always on my heels but I keep him on his toes
[Chorus]
And it might be the highway and it might be these songs
It might be the whiskey or the smoke inside these lungs
Ain't no way around it
One day I'm gonna die
If something's gonna kill me might as well be
What makes me feel alive
[Post-Chorus]
Alive, oh yeah
[Chorus]
It might be the highway and it might be these songs
It might be the whiskey or the smoke inside these lungs
Ain't no way around it
One day I'm gonna die
If something's gonna kill me might as well be
What makes me feel alive
[Post-Chorus]
Alive
Alive
Alive
[Outro]
I've made my peace with God
I ain't afraid to die
If something's gonna kill me
Might as well be what makes me feel alive
