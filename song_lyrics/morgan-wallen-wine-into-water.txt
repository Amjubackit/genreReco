[Verse 1]
Some girls like roses and a man sayin' sorry by the dozen
To heal the heartbreak up, and
Some girls like a letter on a windshield, pourin' out his feelings
When it's all hit the ceilin'
But I know something even better I could try, so
I'm out here soakin' up your porch light glow
With an apology in my left hand
Hope it tastes like a second chance
[Chorus]
'Cause I'm here to say sorry with a to-the-top glass of that Napa Valley vine Cabernet
Girl, I couldn't go to bed, let another second pass without you and mе being okay
So, let's get to thе bottom of these problems and this bottle before that moonlight quits
And turn this wine into water under the bridge
[Verse 2]
A little olive branch romance, drink it off our minds
'Til that twenty minute fight's ancient history
Baby, I just hope you'll forgive me
I'm tipsy, come kiss me, by the time it's empty
[Chorus]
'Cause I'm here to say sorry with a to-the-top glass of that Napa Valley vine Cabernet
Girl, I couldn't go to bed, let another second pass without you and me being okay
So, let's get to the bottom of these problems and this bottle before that moonlight quits
And turn this wine into water under the bridge
[Instrumental Break]
[Bridge]
And I know
Girl, I'm probably walkin' on a tightrope
But I can see you holdin' back a smile, so
What you say we don't stop 'til we get to the last drop?
[Chorus]
'Cause I'm here to say sorry with a to-the-top glass of that Napa Valley vine Cabernet
Girl, I couldn't go to bed, let another second pass without you and me being okay
So, let's get to the bottom of these problems and this bottle before that moonlight quits
And turn this wine into water under the bridge
And turn this wine into water under the bridge
