[Verse 1]
It's somethin' about you that's so familiar
Somethin' that's got me wantin' to know you
And I can't put my finger on it
But it feels, oh like I've been here before
It's somethin' about me that makes me wonder
I swear I met you, but you're a stranger
And I can't put my finger on quite what it is
Oh, but I've been here before
[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe it was me who brought you here
I should run the other way, but I stay right here
[Chorus]
And I'll be a fool for you
I know myself, but I pretend
I leave and I come back again
I'm a fool for you
I love you time and time again
I know just how the story ends, oh
[Verse 2]
Oh, you remind me of someone I once knew
Maybe I'm crazy, but it's hard to ignore you
And I can't wrap my head around it
But it feels, oh like I loved you before
