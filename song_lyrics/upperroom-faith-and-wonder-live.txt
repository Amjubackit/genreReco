[Verse 1]
This name that shakes the mountain tops
The only Word that breaks the curses off
Your name, the one that covers all
It's higher than the others, higher than the others
This name that shakes the mountain tops
The only Word that breaks the curses off
Your name, the one that covers all
It's higher than the others, higher than the others
[Chorus]
Full of faith and wonder
I will say no other name but Yours, name but Yours
Full of faith and wonder
I will say no other name but Yours, name but Yours
[Verse 2]
This name that storms the gates of hell
The only Word my life will live to tell
All the earth will bow beneath the sound
It's higher than the others, higher than the others
[Chorus]
Full of faith and wonder
I will say no other name but Yours, name but Yours
Full of faith and wonder
I will say no other name but Yours, name but Yours[Post-Chorus]
Jesus, Jesus
Jesus, Jesus
Jesus, Jesus
Jesus, Jesus
Jesus
[Bridge]
There is power in the name of Jesus
Sing it louder, oh the name of Jesus
(There is power) There is power in the name of Jesus
Sing it louder, oh the name of Jesus
There is power in the name of Jesus
Sing it louder, oh the name of Jesus
[Chorus]
Full of faith and wonder
I will say no other name but Yours, name but Yours
Full of faith and wonder
I will say no other name but Yours, name but Yours
[Post-Chorus]
Jesus, Jesus
Jesus, Jesus
Jesus, Jesus
Jesus, Jesus[Outro]
Jesus, Jesus
Jesus, Jesus
Jesus, Jesus
