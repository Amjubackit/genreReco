[Verse]
Do you hear that voice inside your head
Whispering to live your dreams instead?
Some people cling to what they know
But I woke up, now it's time to go
Ooh, I can hear it calling
Ooh, did you see me fall in and out of love?
Ooh, I can hear it calling
Ooh, did you see me fall in?
[Pre-Chorus]
Take me over
Now take me out
Give me something
To dream about
[Chorus]
Take me over, take me out
To the jungle through the night in paradise, paradise
Take me over, take me out
To the jungle through the night forever
[Verse]
Hold the things seen only on the screen
Of printer columns, that's no way to live
City's memories from this stereo
But don't sleep cause now it's time to go
