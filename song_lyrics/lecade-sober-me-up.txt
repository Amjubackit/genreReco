[Verse 1]
You found that bottle of pills I hid in the dresser drawer
Them teardrops fallin' like I've never seen before
I was way too high to even cry when your hand hit the door
Red in the eyes, I wonder why I can't get off the floor
Before you leave me
Let me promise one more time that things'll change
You know I'd walk through hell alone to ease your pain
It's hard to exorcise the voices in my brain
Scream or shout to me, it all just
[Chorus]
So give up on me
I'm a waste of time
I'm a long lost cause
Weighin’ on your mind
Yeah watching you leave
Doesn't cut deep enough
Then ain't nothing gonna sober me up
Sober me up
I guess your mom was right, I'm heading nowhere fast
Might be your worst mistake but you won't be my last
I was way too high to start a fight when your hand hit the door
I halfway hope you don't come back so I can't hurt you no more[Chorus]
So give up on me
I'm a waste of time
I'm a long lost cause
Weighin’ on your mind
Yeah watching you leave
Doesn't cut deep enough
Then ain't nothing gonna sober me up
Sober me up
[Bridge]
Before you leave me
Let me promise one more time that things'll change
Even though they can't
[Chorus]
So give up on me
I'm a waste of time
I'm a long lost cause
Weighin’ on your mind
Yeah watching you leave
Doesn't cut deep enough
Then ain't nothing gonna sober me up
Sober me up
