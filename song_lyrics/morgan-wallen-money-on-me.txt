[Verse 1]
If you're lookin' for a drink, if you're lookin' for a dance
If you're lookin' for a wreck in your Friday night plans
Lookin' for your name in a heart on the wall
Lookin' for a number you ain't ever gonna call again
I got you, I'll type it in
[Chorus]
But, baby, if you're lookin' for a sure bet, smooth ride
Dogs-come-and-meet-him-at-the-door-every-night
Kinda right man at the right time
Change your last name while the church bells chime
A soft place to land, arms you can trust
I ain't a bettin' man but, baby, if I was
Honestly, I wouldn't put my money on me
[Verse 2]
Gotta know when it's golden, gotta know when to fold 'em
Never count on a heart like mine
'Causе I'm an up-in-the-air swingin' ferris wheel chair
Might end up stuck in thе sky again
So I don't wanna waste your time
[Chorus]
If what you're tryin' to find tonight is a sure bet, smooth ride
Dogs-come-and-meet-him-at-the-door-every-night
Kinda right man at the right time
Change your last name while the church bells chime
A soft place to land, arms you can trust
I ain't a bettin' man but, baby, if I was
Honestly, I wouldn't put my money on me[Bridge]
To be
There in the morning, anything more than a short memory
If that's what you need we can leave
[Chorus]
But, baby, if you're lookin' for a sure bet, smooth ride
Dogs-come-and-meet-him-at-the-door-every-night
Kinda right man at the right time
Change your last name while the church bells chime
A soft place to land, arms you can trust
I ain't a bettin' man but, baby, if I was
Man, honestly, I wouldn't put my money on me
[Outro]
I wouldn't put my money on me
