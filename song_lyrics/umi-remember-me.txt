[Spoken Intro]
Please, allow me to show you something
[Verse 1]
Wrote you a letter
Now that I’m here without you
Hope that you’re better
Hope that you found someone new
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm getting older
Know that I've changed
And I can't go back now
Nothing's the same
But I won't forget how
You called my name
When I was afraid
And now I'm afraid
[Chorus]
Will you remember me
Will you remember the way that I was
Will you remember me
Will you remember the way that you felt when you're next to me
[Post-Chorus]
Will you remember
Do you remember me
Do you remember
Will you remember me
